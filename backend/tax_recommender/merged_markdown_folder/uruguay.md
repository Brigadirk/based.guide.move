## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
In order to determine the net taxable income, all accrued expenses that are necessary for the generation of Uruguayan-source income and that are duly documented are allowed as deductions. Additionally, taxpayers are able to deduct expenses from their gross income if such expenses are subject to taxation (either foreign or local taxation) in the hands of their counterpart. A compulsory proportional deduction must be calculated when the taxation in the hands of their counterpart is lower than 25% (CIT rate).
## Trading companies
Uruguayan corporations that sell and buy foreign goods and/or services from Uruguay (which are not physically introduced to the country, in the case of goods; or which are not economically used in Uruguay, in the case of services) may determine the net Uruguayan-source income on a notional basis of 3% of the gross margin (difference between the selling price and the purchase price). This gross margin has to be compliant with transfer pricing rules (in line with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] guidelines). The applicable effective CIT rate is 0.75% (25% x 3%).
## Local income taxes
No taxes on corporate income may be levied by municipal authorities or other local governments.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
The Republic of Uruguay is located in South America, between Brazil and Argentina, with a coast on the Atlantic Ocean. It is divided into 19 departments, with Montevideo as the capital and chief port. Spanish is the official language of Uruguay, and the currency is the Uruguayan peso (UYU).
Uruguay has existed as an independent republic since 18 July 1830, when its first Constitution was approved. Since then, it has taken advantage of its natural harbour to become an important commercial centre.
Uruguay has experienced continued gross domestic product (GDP) growth during the last 20 years, which enabled reaching investment grade in 2012 and achieving the largest GDP *per capita* in the region. However, from 2016 to 2019, the economy entered into a period of languished growth that was further exacerbated by the pandemic, resulting in a 6.1% GDP reduction in 2020. During 2020 and 2021, Uruguay was praised by the international community for its handling of the pandemic, with a rapid assessment and display of vaccines for all the population.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Income tax on resident individuals (IRPF)
Income stemming from work (i.e. wages, salaries, etc.) is subject to progressive rates ranging from 10% to 36%. As only a few expenses are allowed as deductions (such as social security contributions and a notional amount corresponding to education, feeding, health, and housing of dependent underage children), almost the whole gross income is subject to this tax.
The income tax rates applicable to resident employees are the following (as of 31 December 2024):
| Annual taxable gross income (UYU\*) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Up to |
| 0 | 518,868 | 0 |
| 518,868 | 741,240 | 10 |
| 741,240 | 1,111,860 | 15 |
| 1,111,860 | 2,223,720 | 24 |
| 2,223,720 | 3,706,200 | 25 |
| 3,706,200 | 5,559,300 | 27 |
| 5,559,300 | 8,524,260 | 31 |
| 8,524,260 |  | 36 |
\* Uruguayan pesos
This tax can also be paid as a family unit. The scale of rates to be applied depends on the income of each of the family group's members. If each of the members earns more than 12 minimal salaries (one minimal salary is UYU 22,268), taxable income before deductions must be added together and then the following scale of rates is applied according to the different income brackets (as of 31 December 2024):
| Annual taxable gross income (UYU) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Up to |
| 0 | 1,037,736 | 0 |
| 1,037,736 | 1,111,860 | 15 |
| 1,111,860 | 2,223,720 | 24 |
| 2,223,720 | 3,706,200 | 25 |
| 3,706,200 | 5,559,300 | 27 |
| 5,559,300 | 8,524,260 | 31 |
| 8,524,260 |  | 36 |
If one of the members earns less than 12 minimal salaries, taxable income before deductions must be added together and then the following scale of rates is applied according to the different income brackets (as of 31 December 2024):
| Annual taxable gross income (UYU) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Up to |
| 0 | 592,992 | 0 |
| 592,992 | 889,488 | 10 |
| 889,488 | 1,111,860 | 15 |
| 1,111,860 | 2,223,720 | 24 |
| 2,223,720 | 3,706,200 | 25 |
| 3,706,200 | 5,559,300 | 27 |
| 5,559,300 | 8,524,260 | 31 |
| 8,524,260 |  | 36 |
Remunerations that employees derive from personal services rendered outside Uruguay to local taxpayers are subject to IRPF at progressive rates ranging from 0% to 36%. Additionally, the source principle of IRPF was widened and includes income derived from technical services. Now advertising services rendered outside Uruguay by self-employed individuals (not included in the company’s payroll) will be taxed, provided those services are incurred to generate taxable income for local corporate income tax (CIT) purposes.
Income derived from mediation, leasing, use, transfer of use, or transfer of federative rights, image rights, and similar of athletes registered in resident sports entities, regardless of the registration period or permanence in Uruguay, is also considered Uruguayan sourced.
As of 2017, income derived from derivative financial instruments (DFIs) obtained by resident individuals is also considered Uruguayan sourced.
IRPF's source principle on capital investments was widened since 2011, including income originated on holding movable assets located outside Uruguay (passive income). The tax is levied on capital investments (e.g. interest, rents, royalties, capital gains) at a flat rate of 12%, with some exceptions. This tax is basically levied on gross income.
## Income tax on non-residents individuals (IRNR)
IRNR is levied on Uruguayan gross income at rates that vary from 7% to 25%. Income obtained by entities resident, domiciled, or located in low-or-no-tax jurisdictions (LNTJs) is taxed at 25%. This tax is mainly collected by way of withholding.
If the non-resident individual obtains income from a Uruguayan source of any kind, then the local CIT payer must withhold IRNR on the corresponding payment.
Also, the general rule for IRNR is that it follows the source principle. As mentioned above, technical services rendered by non-residents (not under a dependency relationship) outside Uruguay, but associated to taxable income for CIT purposes, are deemed to be Uruguayan sourced and subject to IRNR at a rate of 12% or 25% (in case of being from LNTJs). However, it is also stated that when the taxable income for CIT obtained by the local user of said service does not exceed 10% of its total income, then only 5% of the service fee paid or credited abroad will be subject to IRNR. In these cases, the effective tax rate is 0.6% (5% x 12%), or 1.25% if the recipient individual is from an LNTJ on the amount paid or credited abroad. In those cases where the company receiving the service does not obtain income subject to CIT, the service received will be entirely associated with foreign-source income and thus not subject to IRNR.
The following will also be considered Uruguayan-sourced income:

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Tax returns
Monthly tax returns are required to be filed by employers with the tax authorities, exposing the employee income withheld from one’s monthly payroll compensation. Otherwise, each taxpayer is required to file an annual tax return for individuals.
As regards due dates, residents must file the tax return between June and August, depending on their ID number; while non-residents must file it in May.
## Payment of tax
Advance and withholding payments are assessable on individuals on a calendar-monthly basis stated by the tax authority.
Self-employed workers must register with the tax authorities and are required to make advance payments on account of their income tax liability for the current year. In cases where self-employed income derived from rendering of services will be higher than approximately UYU 58,000, certain previously defined taxpayers must withhold at a rate of 7% on gross income.
There is also income tax withholding from salaries. Employers are required to withhold at the appropriate personal rate applied to net taxable remuneration of each employee.
Definitive personal income tax for residents is made in instalments, and the first payment is due towards the end of August. In case of non-residents, final payment is in May.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The following items (among others) are either subject to a reduced 10% VAT rate or exempt from VAT entirely.
Items subject to the 10% VAT rate:
Items exempt from VAT:
Exports are zero rated for VAT purposes. VAT on purchases of the exporters can be recovered in the form of credit certificates that can be (i) used to pay other taxes, (ii) used to pay social security contributions, or (iii) endorsed to suppliers who can pay their own national taxes or their own social security contributions.
According to Law Nbr. 19,210 of financial inclusion and electronic payment means and its regulations, the VAT rate has been reduced for the disposal of goods and services made to final consumers, provided that payment is made through debit cards or electronic money instruments. The current rate reduction results in a VAT rate of 20%. Likewise, other VAT reductions have been implemented for specific cases, provided debit cards or electronic payment methods are used.
VAT requires monthly payments and may require monthly or annual tax returns, depending on the qualification of the taxpayer.
## Customs duties
- Import VAT at the rate of 22%.
- Advanced payment import VAT at a rate of 10%.
- Import VAT at the rate of 10%.
- Advanced payment import VAT at a rate of 3%.
## Mercosur: Origin of goods in free zones
On 21 July 2019, Decision 33/15 issued by the Common Market Council (CMC) of the Mercosur (South American Customs Market) entered into force. This Decision establishes that all goods originated in a member state of the Mercosur, or a third country with the same origin rules (on the basis of an agreement with the Mercosur), shall not lose their origin nature when they pass through a special customs zone, an export processing zone, or a free zone, provided such zones are under customs control.
In order to enjoy the benefits of Mercosur origin, neither the tariff classification of the goods nor their origin nature verified by means of the Certificate with which they enter such zones shall be altered. It should be borne in mind that if the origin nature wants to be maintained, there shall be carried out only operations to ensure the trade, conservation, division into lots or volumes, and operations bearing similar purposes.
This applies when the final destination of the goods is any of the full Mercosur member countries.
## Export duties
Exports are not subject to any taxes, and there are almost no prohibitions regarding the type of goods to be exported. On the contrary, several instruments are offered to promote exports, such as the reimbursement of taxes. *For VAT on exports, please see VAT above*.
The exporter may also recover internal taxes that are added to the cost of the products exported. The amount to be reimbursed is a percentage of the export customs value. Additionally, temporary admission is a regime that consists of the import of raw materials, pieces, motors, package material, and other industrial input, free of customs duties or taxes.
## Excise tax (IMESI)
In general, excise tax applies on the first transaction effected in the domestic market by manufacturers or importers of goods. Exports are not taxable.
Excise tax rates vary for each item, and they are generally fixed by the government within maximum parameters established by law.
Goods subject to the highest rates are alcoholic beverages (from 20.20% to 80%, depending on the alcohol degree), tobacco (from 28% to 70%), lubricants (from 5% to 35%), and gasoline, fuel, and other petroleum products (from 5% to 133%).
This tax requires monthly payments and/or tax returns.
## Net wealth tax (NWT)
All types of legal entities and business enterprise owners are subject to an annual NWT at a rate of 1.5% (3% in case of LNTJ) on the value of net assets. This tax also follows the source principle, whereby only assets located or economically used in Uruguay are taxable. Taxpayers may deduct from the NWT the CIT of the same fiscal year; however, the deduction is currently capped at 1% of the NWT.
The deduction of liabilities from the amount of taxable assets to determine the NWT basis is limited to: (i) the average of debts with local financial institutions, (ii) debts with suppliers of goods (except imports) and services, (iii) taxes not yet due, (iv) debts with governments, international credit offices of which Uruguay is a member and with foreign state financial institutions that lend funds for long-term productive projects, and (v) debts documented in debentures and obligations if their emission is done in a public offering and such papers are quoted in a stock exchange.
## Property taxes
Regarding taxes of relevance for those doing business in Uruguay, *please see Net wealth tax (NWT) above*.
There are additional property taxes of less significance, levied by Municipal authorities (e.g. *Contribución Inmobiliaria*) and by National authorities (e.g. Primary School Tax *[Impuesto de Primaria]*).
Note that the Primary School Tax levied on rural assets has been re-established.
## Tax on real estate transfer (ITP)
ITP applies to the transfer of immovable assets. Transfer is defined in a wide sense, as a sale, a cession of the right to use, a transfer of inheritance rights, etc.
Both parties to the transfer contract are subject to this tax at a rate of 2% on the property’s tax value (according to a National Register, a value generally lower than market value). When the property is transferred without payment, the beneficiary pays tax at a rate of 4% on the property tax valuation, except in instances where the property is transferred to direct heirs or legatees, who pay this tax at a rate of 3%.
The transmissions of taxable assets that take place as a result of the replacement or removal of trustees is excluded from this tax.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp taxes are not applicable in Uruguay.
## Tax of control of corporations (ICOSA)
Upon the set-up of a corporation, ICOSA is payable at a 1.5% rate on a notional basis amount, which is determined annually by the authorities. For fiscal year 2024, the amount of this tax (lump sum) is 50,963 Uruguayan pesos (UYU).
This tax is also due annually for corporations at the end of each fiscal year, at a rate of 0.75% on said notional amount. Even though this tax can be deducted from the NWT, the excess cannot be refunded, acting as a minimum NWT payment. For fiscal year 2024, the amount of this tax (lump sum) is UYU 25,481.
## Payroll taxes
Individual income taxes applicable on employees’ remunerations must be withheld by the employer.
## Social security contributions
The Uruguayan Social Security regime states that hiring personnel under a dependency relationship implicates the obligation (both for employer and employee) of making contributions over the compensations that constitute the taxable basis.
Taxable basis consists of all earning that in a regular and permanent basis, in cash or kind, susceptible to pecuniary appreciation, is perceived by the dependant personnel, in concept of remuneration and product of its personal activity, in the frame of the working relationship. As a general rule, any compensation originated in activities carried out in Uruguay is subject to social security contributions.
The social security contribution rates are applicable on gross remunerations, according to the following percentages:
| Contribution | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retirement contributions (1) | 7.5 | 15 |
| Health insurance | 5 | 3/4.5/5/6/6.5/8 (2) |
| Labour restructuring fund | 0.1 | 0.1 |
| Labour Credit Guarantee Fund | 0.025 | 0 |
| Total social security contributions | 12.625 | 18.1 to 23.1 |
Notes
1. Both employer and employee retirement contributions rates are applicable, up to the monthly amount of UYU 256,821 (until 31 December 2024); the exceeding amount will be exempt.
2. Varies depending on whether the employee is married and whether they have children.

| **Total contributions** | **12.625** | **18.1 to 23.1** |
Notes
1. Both employer and employee retirement contribution rates are applicable up to a monthly amount of UYU 256,821 until 31 December 2024 (the exceeding amount is exempt).
2. There is no health insurance contribution for Corporate Directors. These rates are applicable to employees, as follows:
## Value-added tax (VAT)
## Excise tax
In general, excise tax applies on the first transaction effected in the domestic market by manufacturers or importers of goods. Exports are not taxable.
Excise tax rates vary for each item, and they are generally fixed by the government within maximum parameters established by law.
## Net wealth tax (NWT)
NWT is not only levied on corporate taxpayers but also on the net wealth of individuals (resident or not) located In Uruguay at the end of each civil year at a progressive scale of rates that will depend on their residence. In this sense, while resident individuals will be subject to NWT at a scale of rates from 0.1% to 0.2%, the scale of rates applicable to non-residents individuals are from 0.7% to 1.5%.
Different rules for asset valuation, liabilities, and deductions are applicable to this category of taxpayers.
Furthermore, there is a threshold under which the local net wealth of the individual is considered exempt (currently amounts to approximately USD 155,000). This tax can be paid as a family unit, and, in such cases, the threshold is doubled.

# Uruguay
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year closing date may be chosen by the company. However, certain sectors or industries have mandatory closing dates.
## Tax returns
CIT and NWT are self-assessed, and their tax returns are filed by the end of the fourth month following the date of the year-end.
## Payment of tax
Income and capital taxes are paid monthly by way of advanced payments, which are calculated on the basis of the previous year’s tax. The difference between the advanced tax payments and the total annual tax calculated at fiscal year-end is paid by the end of the fourth month after the fiscal year-end.
## Tax audit process
The taxpayer has the right to appeal an Administrative Act to the Tax Office (DGI) and, simultaneously, to the Executive Branch in an administrative process. Both appeals must be filed jointly within ten days from the notification of the administrative act. If both appeals are tacitly (not expressly resolved within a period of 150 days) or expressly rejected, the taxpayer has the right to appeal to a special court through a judicial proceeding.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Uruguay is five years, which can be extended to ten years in the case of: (i) tax fraud, (ii) not complying with Tax Office registration, (iii) lack of communication of a taxable event, or (iv) not submitting a tax return (among other cases).

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Inventory valuation
Replacement cost is permitted for tax purposes, as well as the first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), or average cost methods, irrespective of the inventory valuation method used for accounting purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as ordinary income for CIT purposes.
Furthermore, for certain capital gains, there are special ways of determining the taxable income (e.g. based on notional income).
Capital gains derived from the transfer of titles/shares issued by Uruguayan entities are subject to a 12% tax rate, applicable to a notional 20% of the transfer price (or 20% of market value of the titles transferred if there is no price). For titles quoted in a Uruguayan stock exchange, the 'real method' can be applied.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from local subsidiaries are exempt.
The general rule is that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries are out of the scope of this tax since they are considered foreign-sourced, thus non-taxable, income.
However, for fiscal years ended as of 31 December 2023, dividends will be taxed by CIT to the extent that they are obtained by an entity that is part of a multinational group and ’substance‘ requirements, as defined in the rules, are not met in Uruguay *(see Foreign-source income below for more information on this matter)*.
## Interest income
Uruguayan-sourced interest income, derived by resident companies in the country, is subject to CIT under the general regime (i.e. taxed at 25%).
## Royalty income
Uruguayan-sourced royalty income, obtained by resident companies in the country, is subject to CIT under the general regime (i.e. taxed at 25%).
## Foreign-source income
CIT payers in Uruguay are only subject to tax on income from Uruguayan sources under the territorial system of taxation. Hence, foreign-source income is not subject to tax. Income derived from activities performed, assets located, or rights utilised outside Uruguay, regardless of the nationality, domicile, or residence of the parties participating in the transactions and the place where the transaction agreements are subscribed, is not subject to CIT.
The following paragraphs address exceptions to this principle.
The following will also be considered Uruguayan-source income:
Additionally, based on amendments to CIT provisions (December 2022), the following items of foreign-source income will be taxed by CIT to the extent that they are obtained by an entity that is part of a multinational group and if ’substance‘ requirements, as defined in the rules, are not met in Uruguay:
The concept of a multinational group is defined by the regulations as a group of two or more related entities, resident in different jurisdictions, including the parent company and its PEs.
On the other hand, the rules establish that the relationship will exist when the entity is a member of a multinational group, which occurs when any of the following conditions is verified:
1. The entity is included in the consolidated financial statements of the group for filing purposes in accordance with the accounting principles generally applied in the jurisdiction of the ultimate controlling entity of the group or would have been included if the entity were required to prepare such statements, or should have been included in them if the equity interests in such entity were traded in a public securities market.
2. If the inclusion hypotheses set forth in paragraph (i) above are met, but it is excluded from the consolidated financial statements of the group solely for reasons of size or relevance.
A qualified entity is such that has an adequate economic substance during the fiscal year. For not being subject to CIT, the condition of qualified entity has to be met with respect to each of the assets generating the items of income stemming from certain assets located outside Uruguay, and during the entire holding period. For such purposes, it will be considered that there is an adequate economic substance for those items of income obtained by an entity that complies with the following conditions simultaneously:
3. It incurs the appropriate expenses and costs in relation to the acquisition, holding, or disposal of the relevant investments.
In relation to the condition of qualified entity in a fiscal year, taxpayers must file an annual affidavit with the Uruguayan Tax Office stating the mentioned points.
Requirements referred to in (ii) and (iii) do not apply for entities whose core business is holding participations in other entities or in real estate.
## Income adjustment for inflation
An income adjustment for inflation applies for the determination of income. It is calculated by multiplying the variation in the consumer price index (CPI) for the financial year by the difference between:
1. total assets at the beginning of the year (excluding fixed assets) and
2. total liabilities at the beginning of the year.
Under an inflation scenario, if (i) is higher than (ii), then an inflation loss adjustment is deducted from gross income. If (ii) is higher than (i), then an inflation gain adjustment is added.
Tax regulations disallow Uruguayan taxpayers to calculate tax inflation adjustment in their CIT return if inflation is below 100% (variation of the CPI accumulated in the 36 months prior to the close of the fiscal year end). To the extent that inflation has not got to those levels, this adjustment is not applicable in practice.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
All Uruguayan-sourced income obtained by non-residents (other than those obtained through a PE in Uruguay) is taxed at flat rates of up to 12% on gross income, with some exceptions. This tax is basically collected by way of WHT.
The exceptions are as follows:
Although the Uruguayan tax law follows the source principle as a general rule, technical services (defined as those rendered in the fields of management, technical administration, or advice of any kind) rendered in another country by non-residents but associated with taxable income obtained by the local user in Uruguay are considered to be Uruguayan sourced for tax purposes and subject to WHT. However, when the taxable income obtained by the local user of the service does not exceed 10% of its total income, then only 5% of the service fee paid or credited abroad will be subject to non-resident WHT. Therefore, in these cases, the effective WHT rate is 0.6% (5% x 12%). In those cases where the local taxpayer receiving the service does not obtain any taxable income, the service received will be entirely associated to foreign-source income and thus not subject to WHT.
This WHT should be declared and paid to the Tax Office on the month following the one in which the tax is withheld.
For those countries with which Uruguay has entered DTTs, the maximum WHT rates are the following (in those cases where the maximum WHT provided by the DTT is higher than the internal law WHT, the latter will be applicable):
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Under internal law | 0/7 | 0/7/12 | 0/12 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |
| Belgium | 5/15 (4) | 0/10 | 10 |
| Brazil | 10/15 (13) | 15 | 10/15 (2) |
| Chile | 5/15 (3) | 4/15 | 10 |

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Social security contributions
The Uruguayan social security system is comprehensive, covering retirement pensions, health insurance, sick pay, and unemployment insurance. Social security contributions are compulsory, based on the salary earned, including bonuses and commissions, and are borne by the employer and the employee.
The employer contributes an amount equivalent to 12.625% and withholds 18.1% to 23.1% from the employee, as follows:
| Contributions | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retirement (1) | 7.5 | 15 |
| Health insurance | 5 | 3 to 8 (2) |
| Labour Restructuring Fund | 0.1 | 0.1 |
| Labour Credit Guarantee Fund | 0.025 | 0 |
| **Total contributions** | **12.625** | **18.1 to 23.1** |
Notes
1. Both employer and employee retirement contribution rates are applicable up to a monthly amount of UYU 256,821 until 31 December 2024 (the exceeding amount is exempt).
2. There is no health insurance contribution for Corporate Directors. These rates are applicable to employees, as follows:
## Value-added tax (VAT)
## Excise tax
In general, excise tax applies on the first transaction effected in the domestic market by manufacturers or importers of goods. Exports are not taxable.
Excise tax rates vary for each item, and they are generally fixed by the government within maximum parameters established by law.
## Net wealth tax (NWT)
NWT is not only levied on corporate taxpayers but also on the net wealth of individuals (resident or not) located In Uruguay at the end of each civil year at a progressive scale of rates that will depend on their residence. In this sense, while resident individuals will be subject to NWT at a scale of rates from 0.1% to 0.2%, the scale of rates applicable to non-residents individuals are from 0.7% to 1.5%.
Different rules for asset valuation, liabilities, and deductions are applicable to this category of taxpayers.
Furthermore, there is a threshold under which the local net wealth of the individual is considered exempt (currently amounts to approximately USD 155,000). This tax can be paid as a family unit, and, in such cases, the threshold is doubled.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Corporate income tax (CIT) regulations on passive income
The Tax Office Resolution Nbr. 488/023 establishes the conditions in which the provisions of Law Nbr. 20,095 and Decree Nbr. 395/022 will apply in relation to certain items of foreign-sourced passive income, including the following:
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
The DTT signed in November 2021 between Colombia and Uruguay for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital was approved by the Uruguayan Parliament on 12 December 2022. As of June 2024, approval by the Colombian Parliament is still pending.
The DTT signed in June 2019 between Brazil and Uruguay for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital entered into force on 21 July 2023. Its provisions generally apply from 1 January 2024.
## Low-or-no-tax jurisdictions (LNTJs)
The Executive Power established the requirements for a country to be considered as an LNTJ. In this context, the Uruguayan tax authorities are empowered to issue a consolidated list for tax and transfer pricing purposes of countries, jurisdictions, and regimes that meet the conditions in order to be considered as an LNTJ.
On 29 December 2022, the Uruguayan tax authorities issued Resolution 2470/2022, which became effective from 1 January 2023. According to this Resolution, as of 1 January 2023, the following jurisdictions are considered as an LNTJ:
| Angola | Jordan | Saint Martin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ascension Island | Kiribati | Saint Pierre and Miquelon |
| Christmas Island | Labuan | Solomon Islands |
| Cocos (Keeling) Islands | Liberia | Svalbard |
| Djibouti | Niue | Swaziland |
| Falkland Islands | Norfolk Island | Tokelau |
| Fiji | Pacific Islands | Tonga |
| French Polynesia | Palau | Tristan da Cunha |
| Guam | Pitcairn Islands | Tuvalu |
| Guyana | Puerto Rico | US Virgin Islands |
| Honduras | Saint Helena | Yemen |
## Value-added tax (VAT) relief of tourist activities
On 22 April 2024, Decree Nbr. 106/024 was issued extending the term of the provisions set forth in Decree 318/021 until 30 September 2024. The regulations established that the following activities will have a reduction of 9% in the VAT rate (standard rate 22%), provided the transactions are executed through electronic means:
For VAT payers under the 'small companies regime', the reduction is determined by applying a discount of 7.38% on the total amount of the transaction.
## Tax relief for small companies: Regulations
In March 2023, the Executive Branch issued Decrees 65/023, 66/023, 67/023, and 71/023, which introduced modifications to CIT and VAT, aiming to reduce the tax burden to small companies.
Regarding CIT, adjustments impact the amount of the monthly payments to be made during the fiscal year as well as the brackets and percentages defined for the ’IRAE ficto‘ (notional CIT) regime, which will no longer be proportional and will start to be applied as a system of progressive rates.
In addition, it was determined that companies that cease to be included in the small companies’ regime as a result of exceeding the annual income limit (approximately 550,000 United States dollars [USD]) during the fiscal year may return to such simplified regime in the following year, as long as the income of the previous one does not exceed the limit.
## Incentives for professionals and technicians of the information technology (IT) sector
In August 2023, Uruguay passed Law Nbr. 20,191 for the promotion of work and settlement in Uruguay of technicians and professionals of the IT sector. This law aims to attract professionals from abroad, both nationals and foreigners, to professionalise the local IT sector and improve the quality of employment. Said law grants an incentive for IT employees, whereby these individuals may opt for being taxed as non-residents (i.e. 12% flat rate) and opt out of the social security scheme. These options are available for the for the year in which the employment relationship is verified and the following four years.
## Accountability Law for Fiscal Year 2022
On 6 November 2023, Uruguay passed Law of Accountability for Fiscal Year 2022, which introduces certain tax provisions that will take effect on 1 January 2024. Among others, the following relevant provisions were introduced.
### Mergers and spin-offs
Legal status is granted to the rule that excludes from computing for tax purposes the goodwill in intra-group restructurings that are not tax-driven and provided the following conditions are met:
In case of non-compliance of the above, taxes must be paid without penalties and interests. The statute of limitations applicable in this case will be ten years. The successor companies will be jointly responsible for the tax obligations of their predecessors in the event of non-compliance.
### Transfer of equity shares
Transfer of equity shares of Uruguayan tax-resident legal entities will be considered carried out at their fiscal value, and thus no tax due would be derived from these operations, provided that the following conditions are met:

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
Legal entities are deemed to be resident in Uruguay when they are incorporated according to the local legislation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The concept of PE in the Uruguayan tax legislation follows, in general terms, the definition provided in the OECD Model Tax Convention, although it has some special clauses that may be found in the United Nations (UN) Model Tax Convention. From a Uruguayan law perspective, the term PE means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on in Uruguay. The term PE especially includes: (i) places of management; (ii) branches; (iii) offices; (iv) factories; (v) workshops; (vi) mines, oil or gas wells, quarries, or any other place of extraction of natural resources; (vii) buildings, constructions, installation projects, or the management activities associated to them, when they last more than three months; and (viii) services, including consultancy services, rendered by a non-resident through employees or other hired personnel by the company for that purpose, to the extent that such activities are developed (in relation with the same or a connected project) during a period or periods exceeding, in total, six months within any 12-month period. Please note that item (viii) constitutes an exception to the OECD model and is based on the provisions of the UN model.
Rules in force expressly state that operations undertaken by taxpayers with, among others, branches or PEs will be subject to the transfer pricing regime. Head offices and their branches/PE must be considered as separate entities for tax purposes, and the transactions and balances between them must be recognised based on the arm's-length principle, with the exception of financial operations.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Straight-line depreciation over useful life is mandatory. Specific rates exist for the following cases: (i) 2% per year for urban buildings, (ii) 3% per year for rural buildings, and (iii) not less than 10% per year for new vehicles. Other rates are accepted if economically justified. No conformity between book and tax depreciation is required.
Percentages for depletion computed on the cost of natural resource properties are allowed in accordance with generally accepted criteria.
Depreciation and depletion percentages are computed on the historical cost of fixed assets revaluated at year-end, based on the variation of the CPI. Capital gains derived from the revaluation of fixed assets are not taxable income.
### Production of software and related services
Law 19,637 introduced amendments to the exemption applicable for activities of production of software and related services, provided the assets are developed, at least partially, in Uruguay. This decree introduces the following complementary provisions regarding the regulation of the referred exemption:
## Goodwill
When transferring a business or a business unit, the difference between sales/transfer price and the fiscal cost of the assets being transferred constitutes 'goodwill'. This goodwill is an asset for the buyer and must not be depreciated, neither for CIT nor for NWT purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses should be depreciated within a period of three to five years. The taxpayer may elect the number of years to depreciate those expenses within those limits.
## Interest expenses
When companies derive both income subject to CIT and either income exempt or not included in CIT (e.g. from a foreign source), interest expenses associated to the former (i.e. deductible interest) will be determined by applying a proportion based on assets.
## Bad debts
As a general rule, only those debts that are at least 18 months old will be deductible as 'bad debts'. However, the rules allow deductions under some other special situations.
## Charitable contributions
Deductibility of charitable contributions will depend on the organisations receiving them.
Furthermore, there is a special regime for certain charitable contributions under which the contributor may deduct 25% of the contribution, and the remaining 75% will be recovered through credit certificates that may be used to pay taxes (with certain limitations).
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties generated from unduly paid taxes are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
CIT and NWT are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Law 19,438 (October 2016) limited the deduction of tax losses from previous years to 50% of the net tax income. However, Law 19,924 (Budget Law 2020 - 2024) eliminated this limitation. In this sense, as of the years ended on 31 December 2020, taxpayers with accumulated losses may deduct them without considering the aforementioned cap.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
All accrued expenses that are necessary for the generation of Uruguayan-source income and that are duly documented are allowed as deductions. Additionally, a taxpayer may deduct expenses from its gross income if such expenses are subject to taxation (either via foreign or local taxation) in the hands of the other party. A compulsory proportional deduction must be calculated when the taxation in the hands of the counterpart is lower than 25% (CIT rate).

# Uruguay
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Uruguay.
Specific provisions regarding the existence of an 'administrative economic unit' are included in NWT law, but only for agricultural and/or farming investments for determining the application of NWT exemption and corresponding NWT rates (i.e. group taxation is still not permitted).
## Transfer pricing
As a general principle, transfer pricing rules are applicable to international transactions between related parties. However, Uruguayan legislation has extended the scope of these regulations to transactions carried out with LNTJs (either international or domestic) and to certain operations through third-party intermediaries. Domestic transactions with Uruguayan FZ users fall under this category.
The definition adopted by the law for related parties is quite broad. Such a relationship is configured when both parties are subject (directly or indirectly) to the management or control of the same individuals or legal entities, or when they have power of decision to direct or define the taxpayer’s activities due either to their participation in capital interest, the level of their credit rights, or their functional or any other type of influence (whether contractual or not).
The transfer pricing documentation shall be kept by the taxpayers for the statute of limitations period (five years; this can be extended to ten years in the case of failure to obtain sworn declarations, failure to register with the tax authorities, or fraud).
In the annual tax return (which expires by the fourth month after the fiscal year-end), all taxpayers must inform whether a transfer pricing adjustment applies (and its amount), as well as the inter-company transactions performed during the fiscal year.
Taxpayers that perform inter-company transactions that exceed the threshold stipulated by rules in force (50 million 'Indexed Units', equivalent to approximately USD 7,775,000, within the fiscal year), or are notified by the tax authorities, will be required to file the following annual information to the tax authorities within the ninth month after the year-end:
It is important to note that there is a new annual obligation for taxpayers that integrate a multinational enterprise of large economic dimensions (i.e. those whose consolidated income exceeds 750 million euros [EUR]) and verify the related party assumptions to file, in addition to the current local file, a Country-by-Country (CbC) report. Additionally, Master File requirements were established (to be specified yet who will be required to file it). Such obligation is in force for fiscal years initiated as of 1 January 2017.
### Country-by-Country (CbC) report
A CbC report is required in Uruguay for fiscal years commencing after 1 January 2017. Legislation contemplates an annual obligation for Uruguayan taxpayers that integrate a multinational enterprise (MNE) of large economic dimensions. To this effect, MNE groups of large economic dimensions are defined as those whose total consolidated income at the end of the group's fiscal year exceeds EUR 750 million.
Taxpayers that comply with these regulations shall submit to the local tax authorities the CbC report.  Information shall be submitted to the Uruguayan Tax Office (*Dirección General Impositiva* [DGI]), and could be used by local tax authorities for complying with their duties and for the exchange of information with competent authorities of foreign states, in the framework of international agreements and respective protocols of understanding ratified by Uruguay, ensuring confidentiality and reciprocity.
Taxpayers will not be subject to file a CbC report when the return is submitted by an entity that integrates the MNE to a foreign tax administration of a jurisdiction with whom Uruguay has an exchange of information agreement in force, and the report can be effectively exchanged with the tax authorities of the jurisdictions of the MNE.
In this sense, taxpayers belonging to MNE groups of large economic dimensions are required to fill a CbC notification. The notification must include the identity and tax residence of the reporting entity. It must be filed annually, prior to the closing date of the report.
Regarding the CbC report, it must be submitted (if corresponds) within a period of 12 months, counting from the closing date of the group’s fiscal year referred to in the report.
### Master File
The minimum content to be included in the Master File is determined by the Regulatory Decree. Taxpayers required to submit the Master File shall prepare a special return to be filed to the DGI within a period of 12 months, counting from the closing date of the group's fiscal year referred to in the report. It is worth mentioning that, at the moment, there is no threshold that determines the obligation of submitting the report.
### Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)
Regarding transfer pricing administration rules, the Executive Power can enter into APAs with taxpayers that cannot cover more than three fiscal years. Additionally, since 2017, the Executive Power can also enter into BAPAs, which includes not only the negotiation with local taxpayers but also with other tax authorities from countries with which the local taxpayer could have inter-company transactions.
Furthermore, strong penalties are set for failure of compliance with transfer pricing formal duties and with other formal documentation requirements.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Uruguay.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Uruguay other than those applicable to individuals.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
CIT is imposed at a rate of 25% on net income derived from business activities carried out in Uruguay. A 7% WHT is imposed on profits remitted or credited to a head office. Profits paid or credited to a non-resident head office will not be subject to WHT when they are paid out of non-taxable income for CIT purposes.
Furthermore, those profits and/or losses derived from financial operations between the branch and its head office will be disregarded for Uruguayan tax purposes (i.e. not taxed in case of income or not deductible in case of costs and/or expenses).

# Uruguay
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Non-qualified entities obtaining non-qualified passive income of foreign source will be liable to CIT, having the right to credit the analogous income tax paid in the foreign jurisdiction against the CIT generated by the same items of income. This credit cannot exceed the portion of the tax calculated prior to the deduction.
## CIT reduction for income reinvested in fixed assets
40% of income reinvested in the purchase of (i) industrial and agricultural machinery, (ii) vehicles and installations, (iii) computers, (iv) telecommunications equipment, and (v) some assets for the tourism industry is exempt from CIT.
20% of income reinvested in the construction and expansion of industrial, agricultural, and tourism buildings is exempt from CIT (limited to 40% of net taxable income in the year of expenditure).
The joint amount of said investments can be deducted from the taxable basis, with a limit of 40% of the annual net profit, once the amount of other exemptions has been deducted. The excess can be deducted (with the same limitations) in the following two tax periods. It is important to mention that income exempt by these provisions cannot be distributed and must be retained as a reserve account, which ultimately can only be capitalised.
Note that the above-mentioned CIT benefit will be exclusively applicable to taxpayers whose income, in the immediately preceding fiscal year to which the investment is executed, does not exceed the amount of 10 million 'Indexed Units' (approximately USD 1,555,000). This limitation is not applicable to professional cargo transport companies.
## NWT exemption
Movable fixed assets directly connected to the industrial cycle and equipment for data processing are exempt from NWT.
All assets directly associated to the development of agricultural and/or farming activities will be exempt from NWT as long as the owners are individuals or companies with nominative shares also owned by individuals. As a consequence of the elimination of the Rural Real Estate Concentration Tax (ICIR), this NWT exemption has been modified. According to Law Nbr. 19,088, this exemption will apply only in cases where the referred assets do not exceed 12 million ‘Indexed Units’ (approximately USD 1,866,000).
## Investment Law 16,906
Uruguay has modified Investment Law 16,906, achieving a better framework for local and foreign investments carried out in the country. To obtain tax benefits, the Investment Law requires that enterprises obtain a government statement in this regard. The Bureau of Investor Assistance is in charge of monitoring the correct compliance of these projects.
The Investment Law grants two types of benefits:
### Automatic benefits
This kind of benefit is only for manufacturing, extractive, or farming/ranching activities, and includes:
### Discretionary benefits
Benefits that may be obtained at the discretion of the Executive Power for any type of business activity (not cumulative with automatic benefits) include:
### Regulatory framework for the Investment Promotion Law - Decree 268/020
It is worth mentioning that the Executive Power updated the regulatory framework for the Investment Promotion Law in 2020. In this regard, it establishes a transition period for the presentation of projects for which it is possible to opt to apply the previous regime (Decree Nbr. 143/018).
Regarding tax benefits, CIT exempted in each fiscal year may not exceed 90% of the tax. If convenient for the taxpayer, the computation term of the exoneration might be suspended for up to two years.
The indicators established by the previous regime through which the tax benefit is determined remain in force, but the new provisions modify their burden in the matrix and the calculation method.
Nevertheless, all investment projects could be assessed through a simplified matrix with only one indicator: job creation.
The calculation of the amount of CIT exemption and the effective period for this benefit is established on the basis of a score determined by the amount of investment committed (tranches) and the number of people to be employed.
On 30 November 2022, the Commission for the Application of the Investment Law issued a document that adjusts the basic general criteria for the operation of Decree 268/020, which modifies the methodology for the calculation of certain indicators and the limits applicable to investments in utility vehicles, electric vehicles, and renewable energies.
### Amendments to Investment Promotion Regime: Law 19,637
Law 19,637 introduced measures in order to promote investments in small companies, generate new incentives for investment and productive development, and adjust the applicable exemption for the software industry.
The main provisions approved are the following:
## CIT exemption for R&D activities in biotechnology, bioinformatics, and software production
The regulations establish a legal framework for the CIT exemption condition for R&D activities in biotechnology and bioinformatics and software production, referring to the fact that to be exempted the assets resulting from the aforementioned activities shall be registered according to the IP protection and registration regulations.
The exemption will apply if the assets are executed, at least partly, in Uruguay, and the amount exempted will be calculated considering the relative weight of the direct development costs incurred in Uruguay in relation to the costs incurred in the rest of the world. The assets that result from such activities can be used abroad as well as locally.
Within the services related to the activity, services of technical advice in the areas of biotechnology and bioinformatics provided by the entities that carry out R&D activities, in relation to certain products, are included.
In addition, a full exemption is available, provided that the referred services are developed in Uruguay. Said fact will be verified when the company employs full-time human resources in accordance with the services provided, and the amount of expenses and direct costs incurred in the country for the provision of said services is adequate and exceeds 50% of the amount of expenses and total direct costs incurred in the year for the provision of the same.
Finally, the exemption is limited to those entities that are CIT payers by their legal status (it excludes some taxpayers that are not corporate entities).
In this context, Resolution 183/020 establishes the frequency in which the tax returns must be filed and the information they must contain for the application of the exemption.
## Auto-saving ‘direction’ benefit
The auto-saving ‘direction’ benefit allows a company to deduct from the CIT basis the amount of the capital increase that occurred as a consequence of the reserves capitalisation or of the in-kind distribution of shares, for an amount equivalent to the investment carried out with the investor’s own funds. The amount of the CIT deduction and the period(s) to which said exemption will apply is granted by the government through a statement issued by the Executive Power.
## Free zones
Following the approval of the Free Zone Law in 1987, this system became an important tool for attracting investments to Uruguay.
It has been utilised for carrying out traditional activities in the free zones (warehousing, logistics, and distribution), for the provision of services (software, finance, call centres, etc.), and for manufacturing activities.
This regime, established by Law Nbr. 15,921 in 1987, was modified in 2017 by Law 19,566 (hereinafter the 'New Law', in force since 8 March 2018), which introduced changes (in line with OECD recommendations) without affecting the rights acquired by free zone users (as guaranteed by the Uruguayan government).
The Law declares 'of national interest in the promotion and development of the free zones, with the objectives of promoting investments, diversifying the productive matrix, generating employment, increasing the capacities of the national labour force, increasing the national added value, promoting the activities of high technological content and innovation, promoting the decentralisation of economic activities and regional development, and in general terms, promoting the insertion of the country in the dynamics of international trade in goods and services and international investment flows'.
In addition, as an exceptional manner, free zone users may perform the following activities outside free zones, within the limits that the Executive Power establishes:
It is also foreseen that users that are settled in free zones located outside the metropolitan area are allowed to perform complementary activities outside the free zone, such as public relations, handling of auxiliary documentation, billing, and collection of goods and services. To do so, they will have administrative offices provided by the free zone operators. It is important to mention that it will not be allowed to carry out operations of sale of goods and services in these administrative offices.
In order to operate in/from the free zone, certain requirements must be fulfilled from an ‘economic substance’ perspective (i.e. there must be an actual economic activity developed in the free zone). In this sense, some modifications were introduced to determine which substantial activities can be developed outside the free zone.
The New Law introduced maximum terms (limits) for free zone contracts, generally up to five, ten, or fifteen years (depending on the activity and type), and filing will be required to free zone users with existing agreements not complying with such limits.
In order to preserve and maintain the condition of free zone status and the corresponding exemptions and benefits, free zone users must employ, as a minimum, 75% of natural or legal Uruguayan citizens within their staff. However, the New Law stated that those free zone users that develop service activities may employ a minimum of 50% of natural or legal Uruguayan citizens during the whole agreement period, as long as the nature of the developed activities requires it and the free zone user makes an effort to employ as many Uruguayan citizens as possible. In this case, an authorisation of the Executive Power will be needed.
Free zone users are exempt from all current and future national taxes, including those taxes for which a specific legal exemption is required, in connection with the activities performed within the free zones. The Uruguayan government guarantees all the exemptions and benefits granted by the law for the term of their contracts. Free zones can be located outside or inside the cities; it depends on the kind of free zone.
The New Law introduced a provision that establishes that income derived from the exploitation of IP rights and other intangible assets will be exempt, provided they derive from R&D activities carried out within the free zone.
Social security taxes, as well as certain WHTs, are excluded from the exemption. WHT on payments of dividends made by these companies to their non-resident shareholders are exempt.
Additionally, the New Law established exemptions for thematic zones for the provision of audio-visual, leisure, and entertainment services outside the metropolitan area.
The rules establish certain provisions related to activities of R&D, such as the information to be included in a tax return that must be filed annually to the Tax Office and its due date, as well as the attribution of the property of the registered assets.
## CIT exemption for trading activities with transit of goods through Uruguay
## Industrial park incentives
Decree 170/019 modifies certain provisions regarding incentives granted to industrial park users by Investment Law 16,906. In addition, in May 2018, Decree 143/018 introduced a new regulatory framework to said law.
In this regard, Decree 143/018 established that the exemption of CIT granted to industrial park users and the period in which the benefit applied, as well as the tax credit given in relation to employer retirement contributions, would be increased by 15%.
Notwithstanding this, Decree 70/019 establishes that for those projects that include investments within and outside of the industrial park, the benefits must be calculated over the investment carried out within it. Also, the amount of the tax credit should be determined, taking into consideration the retirement contributions made on behalf of employees that work within the industrial park.
In February 2020, the Executive Power issued the Decree 79/020, which regulates this regime, updated by Decree 408/022 (22 December 2022). The latter introduced more flexible conditions for accessing the benefits and extended certain terms, aiming to make the regime more attractive.
## Holding companies
## Tax benefits for Shared Service Centre (SSC) activities
Activities carried out by SSCs are granted relevant tax benefits under certain conditions.
For these purposes, an SSC is defined as an entity that belongs to a group of enterprises, which has as its sole activity the effective provision of any of the following services: advisory and data processing services, management or administration (strategic planning, business development, advertising, management, and staff training), logistics and storage, financial management, and R&D, regardless of the place of use; to at least 12 related parties that belong to the same group of enterprises.
In addition, it is clarified that the exploitation of IP rights is not included in this beneficial regime.
Tax benefits granted include the exemption of CIT of 90% of the income derived from the promoted activities and exemption of NWT on the assets involved for five or ten fiscal year-ends, depending on specific compulsory requirements that must be fulfilled. To have access to the five year-end tax benefits, an SSC must comply simultaneously with the following conditions:
The tax exemption period will be extended to ten years when (i) the minimum number of jobs exceeds 300 at the end of the first five year-ends and remains until the end of the exemption period and (ii) the referred training expense exceeds twice the aforementioned amount in the course of the first six year-ends.
Tax benefits under the SSC regime have been extended through Decree Nbr. 330/016. Making benefits more accessible, a CIT exemption of 70% of the income derived from the promoted activities by complying with the following conditions is available:
It is important to note that for the determination of new direct qualified jobs, those that are related to a decrease in jobs of local related entities will not be considered.
Regarding NWT, the exoneration of the assets affected by the activity promoted by the CIT exemption period remains unchanged.

# Uruguay
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Tax transparency law
Tax Transparency Law Nbr. 19,484 introduced a set of provisions aimed to enhance the achievement of international standards on tax transparency and prevention of money laundering, as follows:
## Bank secrecy and identification of title holders
The inclusion of the request of information by a DTT partner is approved as one of the hypotheses under which banking secrecy can be lifted.
### Identification of holders of shares
The identification of holders of bearer and nominative titles representing the capital of entities domiciled or doing business in Uruguay is mandatory. In this regard, Laws Nbr. 18,930 and 19,484 include the compliance of certain obligations for identification purposes. This obligation relies on the holders, who must identify themselves with the Central Bank of Uruguay, providing not only their identity but also the percentage of their participations in the entity.
Information shall be kept by the Central Bank of Uruguay and subject to secrecy, although the Tax Office, anti-money laundering authorities, penal and family courts, and related entities may access them in certain cases, with sufficient and proved justification.
The duty of identification applies to all entities domiciled in Uruguay and to companies incorporated abroad, provided that they act in Uruguay through a PE or if their management is carried out in Uruguay.
### Identification of ultimate beneficial owners
According to the legislation, entities whose share capital is represented through bearer or nominative certificates must also communicate to the Central Bank of Uruguay not only the ownership of those participations but also the ownership chain until reaching its ultimate beneficial owners.
In this regard, the law considers as ‘beneficial owners’ those natural people who directly or indirectly hold at least 15% of the paid-in capital or its equivalent, the rights to vote, or who otherwise exercise the final control of the company.
The law foresees exemptions to the obligation of communicating the mentioned information, such (i) those particular cases where beneficial owners do not hold at least 15% of the paid-in capital; (ii) companies whose titles are listed on a stock exchange of recognised prestige (national or international); or (iii) when in the ownership chain exists an investment fund or trust, also with their participations contributed publicly in the stock exchange. It is worth mentioning that qualifying for this exception does not necessarily consist in not requesting information from those companies since the form must be filled anyway but with less information requested.
Decree 272/022 (September 2022) modified the graduation of sanctions and added more deadlines. The Decree establishes that the obligated entities will have a maximum period of 90 days from the day following the end of the calendar year in which they occur to notify the Central Bank of Uruguay of certain modifications with respect to the entity and with respect to the shareholders and members of the chain of ownership. Among those modifications are the modification of the company's address, personal data of shareholders and directors, etc.
## Tax treaties
Uruguay has entered into DTTs with the following countries:

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Employment income
## Capital gains
Capital gains obtained by individuals (resident or non-resident) upon disposal of shares/quotas in Uruguayan CIT payers are subject to individual taxation at a 12% rate (IRPF or IRNR, respectively).The transfers of titles issued by Uruguayan entities are subject to an effective capital gains tax rate of 2.4% on the transfer price (12% applied to a notional 20% of the transfer price or 20% of market value of the titles transferred if there is no price). The effective rate is of 7.5% when the transferor is resident, domiciled, or located in LNTJs (25% applied to a notional 30% of the transfer price or 30% of market value of the titles transferred if there is no price).
Income derived from the transfer of shares or participations in entities from LNTJs whose assets located in Uruguay exceed 50% of their total investments is deemed to be Uruguayan sourced (thus taxable) for tax purposes.
## Dividend income
Dividends or profits paid or credited by CIT payers to non-resident shareholders are not subject to IRNR when they derive from non-taxable income for CIT purposes (i.e. foreign-source income). In other cases, 7% withholding IRNR will be applicable. Under certain circumstances, non-distributed earnings will also be subject to 7% withholding after three years of being generated.
The same tax treatment is applicable to IRPF, except for dividends or profits paid out of foreign-source income derived from holding movable capital. In this last case, a 12% withholding IRPF rate is applicable.
## Interest income
Loan interests are exempt from IRNR if at least 90% of the CIT payer (debtor) assets generate non-taxable income for CIT purposes. Therefore, interests paid or credited by local entities whose assets are located abroad and exceed 90% of their total assets are free of withholding tax (WHT).
