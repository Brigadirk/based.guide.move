## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are to be stated at the lower of cost or market. The first in first out (FIFO) and average methods are accepted. Conformity of methods used for book and tax reporting is desirable, and the method used should be consistently applied.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale, exchange, or transfer of movable capital assets held by a company, except for securities traded at a stock exchange, are taxable at the normal corporate rate of tax. Capital gain arising on these capital assets held for more than one year, which was earlier taxable to the extent of 75% of the total gain, is now fully taxable.
### Capital gain on immovable properties
The gain arising on the disposal of immovable property shall be computed as the consideration received on disposal of the asset less the cost of the asset and is subject to tax as follows:
#### Properties acquired on or after 1 July 2024
For a company appearing on the Active Taxpayers’ List on date of disposal of property, the rate of tax is 15%.
#### Properties acquired on or before 30 June 2024
Capital gains continue to be taxed at the applicable following slab rate on the basis of the respective holding period:
| Holding period | Tax (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open plots | Constructed property | Flats |
| Where the holding period does not exceed one year | 15.0 | 15.0 | 15.0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds one year but does not exceed two years | 12.5 | 10.0 | 7.5 |
| Where the holding period exceeds two years but does not exceed three years | 10.0 | 7.5 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds three years but does not exceed four years | 7.5 | 5.0 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds four years but does not exceed five years | 5.0 | 0 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds five years but does not exceed six years | 2.5 | 0 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds six years | 0 | 0 | 0 |
Purchase, sale, and transfer of immovable property is subject to advance tax at rates ranging from 3% to 4%, depending upon the gross consideration/fair market price of the immovable property. These rates are subject to increase in case buyer or seller are late filers / non-active taxpayers.
### Capital gain on securities
Gain on disposal of listed securities acquired on or after 1 July 2024 is as follows**:**
For securities acquired during the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2024 (both dates are inclusive), the capital gain continues to be taxed at the applicable following slab rate on the basis of the respective holding period:
| Holding period | Tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Less than one year | 15.0 |
| From one year to two years | 12.5 |
| From two years to three years | 10.0 |
| From three years to four years | 7.5 |
| From four years to five years | 5.0 |
| From five years to six years | 2.5 |
| More than six years | 0 |
Future commodity contracts entered into by members of the Pakistan Mercantile Exchange are subject to tax at a rate of 5%.
The rate shall be 12.5%, irrespective of the holding period, for securities purchased on or before 30 June 2022. The rate shall be 0% for securities acquired before 1 July 2013.
Companies shall be subject to tax at the corporate rate of tax under the normal tax regime in respect of debt securities.
A mutual fund, collective investment scheme, or real estate investment trust (REIT) scheme shall, at redemption of securities, deduct capital gain tax at a rate of 15% for stock funds in case of individual / association of persons or a company. However, the rate shall be 25% for other funds in case of a company. In case of stock funds, if dividend receipts of the fund are less than capital gains, the rate of deduction shall be 15%. No tax shall be deducted if the holding period of a security is more than six years.
Loss on disposal of listed and other securities could earlier only be set off against capital gains (and not allowed to be carried forward). From tax year 2019 and onwards, such loss can be carried forward and set off against future capital gains on such securities, up to a maximum of three years.
Capital gains on statutory depreciable assets, other than immovable property, are chargeable to tax as normal business income in the year of sale. They are measured as the difference between the sale proceeds and the tax written-down value of the relevant asset sold.
No gain or loss shall be taken to arise on disposal of an asset by a resident company to another resident company if certain conditions are met. The required conditions include, *inter alia*, that the transferor is 100% owned by the transferee or vice versa, or both companies are 100% owned by a third company, and the transferee income is not exempt in the year of transfer. The scheme of arrangement must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan or State Bank of Pakistan.
### Capital gain on disposal of Special Convertible Rupee Accounts (SCRAs) and Roshan Digital Accounts (RDAs)
Foreign companies (not having PE in Pakistan) and non-resident individuals investing in Pakistan in debt instruments and government securities through SCRAs and RDAs are subject to a blanket 10% WHT rate on capital gain arising on disposal of these debt instruments and government securities. This deduction shall be full and final discharge of their tax liability.
### Capital gain derived on disposal of assets by non-residents outside Pakistan
Gain on disposal/alienation of any asset derived outside Pakistan by a non-resident person in respect of any asset located in Pakistan shall constitute Pakistan-source income.
With respect to shares of a company, however, the asset shall be treated to be located in Pakistan if:
Where the entire assets of the non-resident company are outside Pakistan, a share or interest in such company will be treated as located in Pakistan to the extent of reasonable attribution.
The above gain is subject to income tax (with no further incidence of tax under any other provisions of law) at the higher of:
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from a company (including mutual funds and REITs, etc.) is generally subject to final tax at 15%; however, a different rate would apply in the following cases:
## Interest income
Interest earned by a company is taxed as its income from other sources, subject to tax at corporate rate of tax on a net income basis. Interest earned by a non-resident company without a PE in Pakistan is taxable subject to the rate provided in the relevant DTT.
## Income from royalties and fees for technical services/offshore digital services
Royalties received by non-residents are deemed to accrue or arise in Pakistan and are taxable if paid by a resident in Pakistan or borne by a PE of a non-resident in Pakistan.
Income from ‘fees for technical services’ and ‘fees for offshore digital services’ are deemed to accrue or arise in Pakistan if paid by a resident in Pakistan or borne by a PE of a non-resident in Pakistan.
Apart from above, income in the form of fees for money transfer operations, card network services, payment gateway services, and inter-bank financial telecommunication services derived by non-resident companies (with no PE) are also brought to tax-net in Pakistan.
The above are subject to DTT provisions for treaty countries.
## Other significant items
Liabilities allowed as a tax deduction in a tax year and remaining unpaid for three subsequent years are deemed to be income in the first tax year following the said three years. Such items are then allowed as a deduction in the year the liability is discharged.
Agricultural income is exempt from federal income tax where the related provincial tax has been paid.
## Foreign income
A resident company is taxed on its worldwide income and on its foreign income as earned. Double taxation of foreign income is avoided by means of foreign tax credits; this relief is allowed to the resident company on the doubly taxed income at the lower of the Pakistan or foreign tax rate.
Foreign loss can only be offset against foreign income and can be carried forward for six years.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Pakistan, located in South Asia, is bordered by India to the east, China to the northeast, Afghanistan to the north and west, Iran to the southwest, and the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman to the south. The northern and western highlands of Pakistan contain the towering Karakoram and Pamir mountain ranges, which include some of the World’s highest peaks: K2 (8,611 metres) and Nanga Parbat (8,126 metres). The Baluchistan Plateau lies to the west; the Thar Desert and expanse of alluvial plains, the Punjab, and Sindh lie to the east. The 1,000 mile long (1,609 km) Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the Kashmir region to the Arabian Sea. Pakistan is divided into 170 districts (including the capital of Islamabad and districts of Azad Kashmir). The official languages of Pakistan are Urdu and English, and the currency is the Pakistani rupee (PKR).
There is a great potential for investment and business opportunities in Pakistan in almost all sectors, considering the size of its population, as it is a habitat of more than 250 million people.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
WHTs are applicable on a multitude of payments made to resident taxpayers by withholding agents specified in the local law (commonly known as ‘prescribed persons’) and on payments to non-residents in connection with Pakistan-source income.
Under the local law, for non-residents having no PE in Pakistan, primarily WHTs are applicable on payments such as fees for technical service, royalties, dividends, interests, insurance premiums, fees for offshore digital services, and fees for money transfer operations, card network services, payment gateway services, and inter-bank financial telecommunication services, etc. The applicable WHT rate on such payments ranges from 5% to 20%, subject to any relief available under the DTT. The tax withheld is deemed to be the final tax liability of the non- resident.
Common payments to non-residents, the applicable tax rate under the local law, and any relief available under the respective tax treaty are tabulated below:

Notes
1. This table is a summary only and does not reproduce all the provisions that may be relevant in determining the application of WHT in each tax treaty.
2. Resident and non-resident imply tax status.
3. Individuals and companies are required to render annual returns of income and pay tax at the applicable rates. Credit is given for WHT deducted.
4. WHT rates for dividends, interest, and royalties given to non-resident corporations and individuals of treaty countries vary depending upon the terms of the relevant tax treaty.
5. The following remarks for dividends should be noted:
6. Certain treaties provide for tax exemption of interest paid to the government or the central bank of the contracting state and on foreign loans specifically approved by the federal government.
7. No concession is provided under the treaty.
8. Royalties are exempt from tax, provided the recipient does not have a PE in Pakistan.
9. N/A.
10. WHT rate depends on percentage of holding in the company.
11. This rate applies if the paying company is engaged in the industrial undertaking.
12. Consideration for technical know-how or information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
13. This rate applies if the beneficial owner is a bank.
14. This rate applies if the paying company operates in preferred areas.
15. This rate applies if the company is owned by the government.
16. 5% is applicable for royalties payable for copyright of a literary, artistic, or scientific work, but excluding cinematograph films and tapes for television or broadcasting. All other royalties are taxable at 15%.
17. 18% is applicable for royalties payable for patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula, or process of any industrial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial and scientific experience; 15% for copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work; and 10% for copyright of cinematograph films or tapes for television or radio broadcasting.
18. 10% is applicable for royalties payable for copyright of literary, artistic, and scientific work. All other royalties are taxable at 20%.
19. The rate applies if the beneficial owner is a financial institution, an insurance company, or investment company.
20. This rate applies if the beneficial owner of dividends is a company.
21. 0% applicable in case interest is being earned by the government, a company 51% or more shares of which are held by the government, or the loan is guaranteed by the government or any of its institutions.
22. 10% applies if the interest is received in virtue of a contract of financing or of delay in payment relating to the sale of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or to the construction of industrial, commercial, or scientific installations, as well as of public works.
On a general note, where a treaty provides a WHT rate that is over and above the rate provided in the local law, the company may take relief under the local law.
Where a payer is required to remit an amount to a non-resident without deduction of tax, they can apply to the Commissioner for an exemption certificate. The Commissioner is required to pass an order on that application within a period of 30 days. In case the Commissioner fails to pass an order within the stipulated time period of 30 days (excluding the period for which the taxpayer sought adjournment), the certificate shall be automatically processed and issued by FBR IRIS web-portal. The Commissioner is, however, empowered to modify or cancel such automatically issued certificate after recording reasons in writing and providing an opportunity of being heard to the applicant.
For resident taxpayers and non-residents having a PE in Pakistan, WHTs are applicable on a number of the transactions, including sale of goods, execution of contracts, and rendering of services. These taxes are generally considered as transaction-based minimum taxes (except for sale of goods by a manufacturer or a company listed on a Pakistani stock exchange) and are adjustable against a person’s annual tax liability.
It should be noted that certain WHTs are enhanced by 100% where a taxpayer does not appear on the Active Taxpayers List (ATL).

| Income (PKR\*) | | Super tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 150 million | 200 million | 1 |
| 200 million | 250 million | 2 |
| 250 million | 300 million | 3 |
| 300 million | 350 million | 4 |
| 350 million | 400 million | 6 |
| 400 million | 500 million | 8 |
| 500 million |  | 10 |
\* Pakistani rupees
The concept of super tax was reintroduced by the government on high earning persons in tax year 2022. Slab-wise rates were prescribed for tax year 2022 with a maximum rate of 4%. With regard to certain specified sectors, an enhanced rate of 10% was prescribed for tax year 2022 only, and for banking companies, 10% super tax was applicable for tax year 2023.
In relation to the retrospective application of super tax for tax year 2022 and enhanced rate applicable for specified sectors causing discrimination, Constitution Petitions were filed before Higher Courts in Pakistan. The matter is currently sub-judice before the Supreme Court.
Through Finance Act, 2023, new slab rates (*as provided in tabular form above*) for super tax were introduced and are applicable for the tax year 2023 and onwards. As a result, the highest slab rate of 10% will be applicable on taxpayers from all sectors having income in excess of PKR 500 million, thus eliminating the discrimination.
## Taxation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) engaged in the manufacturing sector
An SME is defined as a person who is engaged in manufacturing of goods whose business turnover in a tax year does not exceed PKR 250 million. In the case that annual business turnover exceeds PKR 250 million, it shall cease to be an SME for such tax year and onwards.
An SME is required to register with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on the IRIS web portal or the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) on its SME registration portal. A company covered by the definition of an SME will not qualify as a ‘small company’.
For the purpose of taxation, SMEs are classified into the following two categories, and tax on taxable income is required to be computed at the rates given below:
SMEs can also opt to be taxed under the final tax regime (FTR). The said option is required to be exercised at the time of return filing, and the same will be irrevocable for three tax years. The SMEs who opt to be taxed under the FTR shall not be subject to tax audit under sections 177 and 214C. The category-wise rate of tax under the FTR is given below:
Minimum tax on turnover shall not apply to SMEs.
## Taxation of exports
### Export of goods
Since the early 1990s, export of goods remained subject to the FTR, whereby WHT collected by the Authorised Dealers on remittance of export proceeds was considered to be final discharge of their tax liability, irrespective of underlying income/loss. A similar tax regime was also applicable for entities operating in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) as well as for indirect exporters.
Through Finance Act 2024, the regime for direct/indirect exporters has been amended, whereby tax collected from them at the rate of 1% is to be treated as minimum tax, and such persons shall be required to compute their normal taxable income/loss in accordance with applicable provisions and in case the 1% WHT is lower than tax computed on such taxable income the incremental tax will have to be paid. As a result of change in tax regime, exporters will also be liable to pay super tax as against the earlier position regarding non-applicability on their income having been subject to final tax.
Apart from the above, a new provision has now been added in the advance tax section whereby specified withholding agents are now required to collect 1% advance income tax from the exporters of goods (whether direct or indirect) at the time of realisation of export proceeds, etc.
### Export of services
Export of services is subject to the FTR, whereby WHT collected at the rate of 1% (0.25% applicable only in case of an IT/IT-enabled service provider registered with Pakistan Software Export Board till tax year 2026) by the Authorised Dealers on remittance of export proceeds is considered to be final discharge of their tax liability, irrespective of underlying income/loss and subject to certain conditions. However, taxpayers can opt to be taxed under the normal tax regime, where the corporate tax rate applies (*as tabulated above*).
## Taxation of builders and developers
Builders and developers are subject to a special tax regime based on their taxable profits from specific activities, as follows:
Where a taxpayer, while explaining the nature and source of the amount credited or the investment made, money or valuable article owned, or the funds from which the expenditure was made, takes into account any source of income that is subject to tax as above, the taxpayer shall not be allowed to take credit of any sum as is in excess of taxable profits as computed above. If, however, one’s actual taxable income is more than the taxable profits as computed above, the taxpayer shall be entitled to take credit of such excess income subject to the payment of tax at the applicable normal rates.
A builder or developer established by an Act of the Parliament or a Provincial Assembly or by a Presidential Order and who is engaged in activities for the benefit of its employees or otherwise (including activities for the planning and development of and for providing and regulating housing and ancillary facilities in a specified or notified area) is not covered by this regime.
## Taxation of a permanent establishment (PE)
The following principles shall apply in computing taxable income of a PE:
| **Description** | WHT ra**te (%)** | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sale of goods | 5 |  |
| Services | 9 |  |
| Execution of contract | 8 |  |
The above stated rates are enhanced by 100% in case of inactive taxpayers.
Minimum tax on turnover is also applicable at a rate of 1.25% on PE of a non-resident. In certain cases/sectors, such turnover tax is payable at rates less than 1.25% (ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% of turnover). *For detail, refer to Minimum tax on turnover below*.
## Taxation of certain contracts executed by non-resident persons
Income derived by non-resident persons/their affiliates from turnkey contracts that are part of an overall arrangement for supply of goods, installation, construction, assembly, commission, guarantee, and supervisory activities, including offshore supply of goods (i.e. cohesive business operation), constitutes Pakistan-source income.
‘Cohesive business operations’, includes:
In case of payment against transactions that constitutes part of an overall arrangement of a cohesive business operation, the Commissioner (on application made by the payer) may allow the person to make payment after deduction of tax equal to 20% of tax chargeable on such payment, which is normally 8%. Consequently, the effective rate of withholding in the instant case shall be 1.6%. This rate is 1% in case of offshore supply contract for an independent power producer (IPP) located in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain conditions.
## Minimum tax on turnover
Where the tax payable by a company is less than 1.25% of the turnover, the company is required to pay a minimum tax equivalent to 1.25% of the turnover, except where the company is exempt from levy of minimum tax. In certain cases/sectors, such turnover tax is payable at rates less than 1.25% (ranging from 0.25% to 0.75 % of turnover).
Tax paid in excess of normal tax liability in the instant case can be carried forward for adjustment against normal tax liability of the subsequent three tax years.
## Transaction-based minimum taxes
Certain WHTs applicable on payments made to residents and non-residents are considered as minimum tax while determining their corporate tax liability on a net income basis. These transactions, *inter**alia*, include sale of goods (unless by a company being a manufacturer of such goods or by a company listed on a Pakistani stock exchange), rendering of services, and execution of contracts (unless payment received by a company listed on a Pakistani stock exchange).
Advance income tax paid at the import stage is minimum tax in case of commercial importers, while it is an adjustable tax on import of raw material by industrial undertakings, with few exceptions.
## Alternate Corporate Tax (ACT)
Under the ACT, the minimum tax liability of a company is the higher of 17% of accounting income or the corporate tax liability determined under the Ordinance, including minimum tax on turnover. This concept is applicable for all companies except insurance companies, companies engaged in exploration and production of petroleum, banking companies, and companies enjoying a reduced rate of tax.
Exempt incomes, capital gain on disposal of specified listed securities, income entitled to 100% tax credit on account of equity investment, and income of non-profit organisations, trusts, and welfare institutions are not subject to levy of ACT.

# Pakistan
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is 1 July through 30 June.
## Tax returns and statements
An individual is required to file a return of income with the tax authorities on a fiscal year basis (1 July through 30 June). Filing of a revised return requires prior approval of the Commissioner, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The Commissioner is now also empowered to grant approval for revision of a return for a bona fide omission or wrong statement.
Every resident taxpayer filing a return of income is required to file a wealth statement (in the prescribed format) along with the return of income. The Commissioner can also require any person to furnish the said statement. For revision of a wealth statement, an intimation has to be filed with the Commissioner, who is empowered to disallow/disregard such revision in case he/she is of the view that the same has not been made for correction of bona fide errors or omissions. A taxpayer has been allowed to make revision of a wealth statement up to a period of five years.
Every resident taxpayer being an individual and having foreign income equal to or in excess of 10,000 United States dollars (USD) or having foreign assets with a value of USD 100,000 or more is now also required to file a separate statement of foreign income and foreign assets in a prescribed format. The Commissioner can also require any person to furnish such statement.
All individuals (including salaried persons) are required to file their return/wealth statement for the year ended 30 June by 30 September. Late filing shall be liable to penalty proceedings.
Persons whose income was subject to the final tax regime were previously required to file a statement prescribed in the law in lieu of a return of income; however, such requirement has now been omitted. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is to prescribe returns for different classes of income or persons, including those covered by the final tax regime.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries by the employer. The amount to be withheld is determined by applying to the salary the average rate of tax on the estimated income of the employee for the fiscal year.
Advance tax is payable by an individual (other than a salaried individual) in four instalments if the latest assessed taxable income is in excess of PKR 1 million.
## Statute of limitations
An audit of the tax return filed by a taxpayer can be conducted by the tax authorities within five years of the end of the financial year in which the return is filed. A person whose income tax affairs have been audited in any preceding four tax years shall have immunity from selection of audit. However, amendment proceedings may be initiated other than by way of selection of audit.
Tax authorities can probe into the source of unexplained offshore assets and foreign-source income irrespective of any time limitation.
The time period to pass an amendment order is 180 days from the issuance of show cause notice.
The tax authorities mainly focus their attention on taxpayers other than salaried individuals.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Pakistan levies tax on its residents on their worldwide income. A non-resident individual is taxed only on Pakistan-source income, including income received or deemed to be received in Pakistan or deemed to accrue or arise in Pakistan. Salary is considered Pakistan-source income to the extent to which it relates to employment exercised in Pakistan, wherever paid.
## Personal income tax rates
The following tax rates apply where income of the individual from salary exceeds 75% of taxable income:
| Taxable income (PKR) | | Tax on column 1 (PKR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 600,000 |  | 0 |
| 600,000 | 1,200,000 |  | 5 |
| 1,200,000 | 2,200,000 | 30,000 | 15 |
| 2,200,000 | 3,200,000 | 180,000 | 25 |
| 3,200,000 | 4,100,000 | 430,000 | 30 |
| 4,100,000 |  | 700,000 | 35 |
The following tax rates are applicable in other cases (for individuals and associations of persons [AOPs]):
| Taxable income (PKR) | | Tax on column 1 (PKR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 600,000 |  | 0 |
| 600,000 | 1,200,000 |  | 15 |
| 1,200,000 | 1,600,000 | 90,000 | 20 |
| 1,600,000 | 3,200,000 | 170,000 | 30 |
| 3,200,000 | 5,600,000 | 650,000 | 40 |
| 5,600,000 |  | 1,610,000 | 45 |
Individuals and AOPs with taxable income exceeding PKR 10 million in a year must pay a surcharge equal to 10% of their income tax.
In the case of an AOP that is a professional firm prohibited from incorporating by any law or the rules of the body regulating their profession, a maximum of 40% tax rate has been prescribed.
## Withholding requirements
In general, the entire tax is deducted at source on payment of salary to individuals at rates mentioned above for salaried individuals. Varying withholding tax (WHT) rates are prescribed for different goods, services, and contracts provided and executed by individuals and AOPs, based on status of the vendor being an active taxpayer or not.
## Local taxes on income
The only significant tax on salaries is federal income tax.

# Pakistan
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is 1 July through 30 June. However, tax authorities are empowered to approve a special year-end.
## Tax returns
All companies are required to file an income tax return each year by 31 December for the preceding financial year (1 July through 30 June) by accounting for business income on an accrual basis. If the special year granted by the tax authorities ends between 1 July and 31 December, then the tax return is required to be filed by 30 September following the year-end.
An across-the-board deemed assessment scheme is in place whereby assessment is taken to be finalised upon filing of the return. The Commissioner, however, has powers to amend the assessment if it is believed that the assessment made is prejudicial to the interest of revenue or on the basis of audit or definite information that any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment/has been under assessed/has been assessed at a lower rate or there is any misclassification between various heads of income. These powers are to be exercised within a prescribed time frame. In the case of transactions between associates, the Commissioner can substitute the transaction value with the fair market consideration. The Commissioner is also empowered to determine tax liability according to the substance of the transaction, disregarding formal arrangements between the parties.
Persons subject to final tax regime were required to file a statement prescribed in the law in lieu of return of income. The concept of statement in lieu of return has now been omitted with such persons now required to file a return income. The FBR is to prescribe returns for different classes of income or persons, including those covered by final tax regime.
Tax authorities can require a person whose name is not appearing in the ATL to file an income tax return.
Filing of a revised return requires prior approval of the Commissioner, unless it is revised within 60 days, which has certain limitations and conditions. The Commissioner is also empowered to grant approval for revision of return for bona fide omission or wrong statement.
## Payment of tax
Companies are required to pay advance tax on the basis of tax liability of the immediately preceding tax year in respect of their income (excluding capital gains and presumptive income). The advance tax is to be paid after taking into consideration the liability for super tax and after adjusting the taxes withheld at source.
Advance tax is required to be paid in four quarterly instalments on or before 25 September, 25 December, 25 March, and 15 June in each financial year. Credit for tax paid in a tax year shall be allowed against tax liability of that year. However, in case of banking companies, such advance tax is payable on a monthly basis.
The total tax liability is to be discharged at the time of filing the return of income. However, penal action is prescribed in the law where tax payable at the time of filing of return is in excess of 10% of the total tax liability.
Advance taxes and taxes withheld are adjustable against the tax payable with the return of income.
## Tax audit process
The FBR is authorised to prescribe criteria for selection of audit of taxpayers who have filed their returns for a tax year. Based on such criteria, cases are selected through computer ballot separately for income tax, sales tax, and federal excise duty. The returns are examined by tax authorities, and related documents and information are requisitioned. Show-cause notices are then raised and, on receipt of explanations from taxpayers, income or loss is assessed. In case of disagreement with assessments, the taxpayer has the right to agitate the issues before appellate forums.
The concept of an ‘agreed assessment’ is also present in the local income tax law. A taxpayer intending to settle a case may file an offer of settlement in the prescribed form before the ‘assessment oversight committee’, in addition to filing a reply to the notice of amendment proceedings. The Committee shall decide its position on the said offer and communicate to the taxpayer. In case of agreement, the taxpayer can deposit the tax due, with the Commissioner passing an amendment order to this effect (in which event the taxpayer shall lose the right to appeal); otherwise, the matter would again be referred back to the Commissioner for continuation of the amendment proceedings in the routine manner. This option is, however, not available in cases involving concealment of income or where the interpretation of question of law is involved and having an effect on other cases.
The taxation authorities can apply generic sectoral benchmarks and ratios, etc. for determination of taxable income disregarding the results furnished by a taxpayer. This provision will only apply where a case is selected for tax audit and the taxpayer fails to provide the information/documents/explanations required during such audit.
The Commissioner, in addition to being authorised for having access to taxpayers’ premises, place, accounts, documents, or computer, if required, in pursuance of any audit or other proceedings initiated under the Ordinance, is also allowed real-time electronic access to such records of the taxpayer. The Commissioner is also permitted to conduct audit proceedings electronically through video links or any other prescribed facility.
## Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR)
An aggrieved person may apply for resolution of a dispute pending before any court of law or appellate forum through the ADR mechanism in the following cases:
The aggrieved person shall file an application for dispute resolution accompanied by an initial proposition for resolution of dispute, including an offer of tax payment. The FBR shall, within a period of 15 days of the receipt of the application, constitute a committee for that matter, which shall make a decision on the dispute with 45 days (extendable to another 15 days).
The taxpayer, if satisfied with the decision of the ADR, is required to withdraw their appeal filed before any court of law or appellate forum.
## Statute of limitations
An audit of the tax return filed by a taxpayer can be conducted by the tax authorities within five years of the end of the financial year in which the return is filed. A person whose income tax affairs have been audited in any preceding four tax years shall have immunity from selection of audit.
Tax authorities can probe into the source of unexplained offshore assets and foreign-source income irrespective of any time limitation.
The time period to pass an amendment order is 180 days from the issuance of show cause notice.
Nevertheless, the FBR is empowered to extend the time limitation for any application to be made or any act or thing to be done, subject to certain conditions.
## Advance rulings
A non-resident not operating in Pakistan through a PE can apply to the FBR to issue an advance ruling setting out the Board’s position regarding application of the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance to a transaction proposed or entered into by the taxpayer. The tax ruling, once issued, is binding on tax authorities.
Tax authorities focus on the following issues:

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
A company is resident in Pakistan if it is incorporated or formed by or under the law of Pakistan or if the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in Pakistan in that year.
The term ‘company’ includes a trust, a cooperative society, a finance society, or any other society established or constituted by or under any law; a corporate body incorporated outside Pakistan; and any foreign association, incorporated or unincorporated, that the Federal Revenue authorities may declare to be a company.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
As per the local tax law, PE in relation to a person means a place of business through which the business of the person is wholly or partly carried on, and includes the following:
- in the name of the person
- for the transfer of the ownership of or for the granting of the right to use property owned by that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use, or
- for the provision of services by that person, or
For removal of doubt, it is clarified that an agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of business does not include a person acting exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of the person to which it is an associate.
For the removal of doubt, it is clarified that:
The definition of a PE provided in a double tax treaty (DTT) will prevail in cases where a DTT is executed by Pakistan with the related country of origin of the PE.
### Associates
Two persons shall be associates in the following instances:
Two persons shall not be associates solely by reason of the fact that one person is an employee of the other or both persons are employees of a third person.
Without limiting the generality of the descriptions above and below, the following shall be treated as associates:
Two persons shall not be associates under the first two bullet points above where the Commissioner is satisfied that neither person may reasonably be expected to act in accordance with the intentions of the other.
Under this scheme:
1. an ancestor, a descendant of any of the grandparents, or an adopted child of the individual or of a spouse of the individual, or
2. a spouse of the individual or of any person specified in (i).
## Business connection
Business income of a non-resident is, *inter-alia**,* considered to be Pakistan-sourced income to the extent to which it is directly or indirectly attributable to a ‘business connection’ in Pakistan. Through the Finance Act 2024, the concept of ‘business connection’ has been expanded to include ‘significant economic presence in Pakistan’ of a non-resident.
‘Significant economic presence in Pakistan’ has been defined as:
Non-resident persons covered by an applicable DTT shall not be affected by the above amendment as the provisions of the DTT override domestic tax legislation, subject to certain general anti-avoidance provisions.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Depreciation
Normal depreciation is allowed at the following prescribed rates by applying the reducing-balance method.
| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 10 |
| Furniture (including fittings) | 15 |
| Machinery and plant, including motor vehicles and ships | 15 |
| Aircraft and aero engines | 30 |
| Ramps built (up to PKR 250,000) to give access to persons with disabilities | 100 |
| Offshore platform | 20 |
All depreciable assets put into service for the first time in Pakistan during a tax year, other than buildings, road transport vehicles not plying for hire, furniture (including fixtures), plant and machinery used previously in Pakistan, plant and machinery for which a deduction has been allowed under another section of this ordinance, for the entire cost of the asset, immovable property, or structural improvement (even if classifiable as plant and machinery), shall be entitled to an initial allowance at 25% of the cost of the asset.
Book depreciation need not conform to tax depreciation. Unabsorbed tax depreciation not set off against the income of the year is carried forward and added to depreciation of the assets of the same business in the following year. Tax depreciation can be carried forward for adjustment against income of future years for an unlimited period. However, such deprecation is only allowed to be set off to the extent of 50% of taxable profits of a particular (succeeding) tax year in cases where the same is PKR 10 million or more. The remaining amount can, however, still be carried forward/adjusted in future tax years.
Full tax depreciation deduction is allowable in the first year of addition of an asset used for the purpose of business, and no depreciation deduction is allowed in the year of disposal.
## Amortisation of intangibles
The cost incurred on acquisition of a patent, invention, design or model, secret formula or process, copyright, software, quota, licence, intellectual property (IP), or other like property or right, and any expenditure that provides an advantage or benefit for a period of more than one year, is allowed as a deduction on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset, but not exceeding a period of 25 years for assets whose life cannot be ascertained.
Self-generated goodwill or any adjustment arising on account of accounting treatment (e.g. that arising on account of mergers, acquisitions, and business reorganisations) is excluded from the purview of ‘intangible assets’ and no amortisation is allowable thereon.
Unabsorbed tax amortisation not set off against the income of the year is carried forward and added to amortisation of the assets of the same business in the following year. Tax amortisation can be carried forward for adjustment against income of future years for an unlimited period. However, such amortisation is only allowed to be set off to the extent of 50% of taxable profits of a particular (succeeding) tax year, in cases where the same is PKR 10 million or more. The remaining amount can be carried forward/adjusted in future tax years.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Expenditure incurred before the commencement of a business wholly and exclusively to derive income chargeable to tax can be deducted over a period of five years.
## Interest expense
Interest expense is allowed as an expense if required WHT is deducted and deposited in the government treasury.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are allowed as deductible expenditure if the following conditions are satisfied:
## Charitable contributions
## Fines and penalties
Fines or penalties that are not paid or payable for the violation of any law, rule, or regulation are allowable as tax deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Taxes on income are not deductible. Sales tax and excise tax are tax deductible where these are to be absorbed by the business; otherwise, these are passed on to the consumer.
## Other significant items
Exchange gains and loss on foreign currency loans specifically obtained for acquiring an asset are adjusted against the depreciable cost of the asset.
Any lease rental incurred by a person in the tax year to a scheduled bank, financial institution, approved *modaraba*, or approved leasing company shall be a deductible expense. However, financial charges paid for the above-mentioned leases are added back into the taxable income of the company.
Lease rentals deduction claimed by a lessee in respect of cost of passenger transport vehicles not plying for hire (to the extent of principal amount) shall not exceed PKR 2.5 million. With regard to depreciation on passenger transport vehicles not plying for hire, the limit on cost at PKR 2.5 million has been enhanced to 7.5 million.
An industrial undertaking will not be allowed to claim certain proportion of expenditure attributable to sales made to persons who are required to be registered but not registered under the Sales Tax Act, 1990 where the aggregate sales to such unregistered person is PKR 100 million or above per person. The expenditure to be disallowed under this provision will not exceed 10% of total deductions claimed by the industrial undertaking. Thus, expenditure attributable for sales to unregistered persons beyond the said threshold would still remain allowable.
Certain businesses in Pakistan are required to install prescribed fiscal electronic devices and software for integration with the FBR system. Non-compliance of the said requirement would render attributable expenditure inadmissible to the extent of 8% of the total deduction claimed. Prescribed penalty shall also be imposed on such person.
## Net operating losses
Operating losses may be carried forward and set off against the profits of the succeeding six years of the same business in which the losses were incurred. Unabsorbed depreciation/amortisation can be carried forward indefinitely (subject to restrictions discussed above).
Assessed losses of an entity in the case of group relief cannot be utilised if the ownership of the holding company is reduced to less than 55% and 75% if one of the companies is a listed company or none of the companies is a listed company, respectively.
Business losses can be carried forward up to a period of six years in the case of the amalgamation of two companies, with the condition that the same business is continued for a minimum period of five years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The deductibility of a head office expenditure of a non-resident taxpayer is limited to the same proportion of total head office expenditure as the Pakistan turnover has with the total world turnover. However, such domestic rules are overridden if the branch is a tax resident of a country having an agreement for avoidance of double taxation (treaty) and that treaty provides a different basis.

# Pakistan
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
A locally incorporated holding company and subsidiary of a 100%-owned group may be taxed as one group by giving an irrevocable option for taxation as one fiscal unit. In such a case, besides consolidated group accounts, computation of income and tax payable shall be made for tax purposes.
Group relief is not available for losses prior to formation of the group. Group relief is available if the companies are designated as entitled to avail group relief by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. Inter-corporate dividends are, however, exempt from levy of tax in case of entities availing group taxation.
Any company that is the subsidiary of a holding company may surrender its assessed loss for the year to its holding company or its subsidiary (in the proportion of the shareholding held by the holding company in the subsidiary), or between another subsidiary of the holding company, provided that the holding company directly holds 55% or more capital of the subsidiary if one of the companies is a listed company. However, if none of the companies is a listed company, the holding requirement is 75% or more. The loss can be surrendered for a maximum of three years, and the required holding is for at least five years.
## Transfer pricing
The tax authorities have the power in respect of a transaction between associates to distribute, apportion, or allocate income, deductions, or tax credits between such associates to reflect the income that would have been realised in an arm’s-length transaction. Companies are required to maintain specified records and documents for transactions between associates, and tax authorities can require information and documents for such transactions.
The Commissioner is empowered to appoint, with prior approval of the FBR, a Chartered Accountant or a Cost and Management Accountant to determine the fair market value of an asset, product, expenditure, or service in respect of a transaction where the Commissioner is of the view that the same has not been undertaken on an arm’s-length basis. In case the Commissioner is satisfied with the report, the Commissioner can proceed by considering the same as definite information for amendment of assessment. In case of being dissatisfied, the Commissioner can also seek report from another accountant.
Through the Finance Act 2024, the Commissioner has been empowered to disallow 25% of the total expenditure on account of sales promotion, advertisement, and publicity and allocate to an associate with whom an arrangement for royalty on certain intangibles is in place where such taxpayer (upon issuance of notice by the Commissioner) fails to furnish any explanation or evidence that no benefit has been conferred on the associate as a result of incurring such expenditure. For non-residents protected by an applicable DTT, it can be argued that no such allocation is permissible as long as the royalty itself is on an arm's-length basis.
### Transfer pricing documentation and country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Transfer pricing documentation requirements have also been provided in law in order to comply with the requirements of various international Conventions/Agreements executed by the government (*see Base Erosion and Profit Shifting [BEPS] in the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section*), *inter alia*, including the following:
Every ultimate parent entity or surrogate parent entity in Pakistan that is part of an MNE group resident in Pakistan and whose consolidated group revenue is 750 million euros (EUR) or more during a fiscal year is required to file a CbC report for each country wherein the constituent entities of the MNE group operates.
A constituent entity (including a PE of a company) of an MNE group (not being the ultimate parent or surrogate parent) is also required to furnish a CbC report in case:
The CbC report should contain the following information for each country wherein the constituent entities of the MNE group operates:
## Thin capitalisation
Where a foreign-controlled resident company (other than a financial institution or a banking company) or a branch of a foreign company operating in Pakistan has a foreign-debt-to-foreign-equity ratio in excess of 3:1 at any time during a year, a deduction shall be disallowed for the profit on debt (interest) paid by the company in that year on that part of the debt that exceeds the 3:1 ratio.
A new formula (in addition to that explained above) has been introduced to restrict the deduction of foreign ‘profit on debt’ incurred by any foreign-controlled resident company in Pakistan (other than a banking and insurance company) during a tax year with a carry forward mechanism provided (up to a period of three years) subject to the same overall limits each year.
B – ([A + B] x 0.15)
Where:
This change shall not apply to a foreign-controlled resident company if the total foreign profit on debt claimed as deduction is less than PKR 10 million for a tax year.
It has also been provided that disallowance on this account shall be the higher of the amount of determined on the basis of the foreign debt-foreign equity ratios and that arrived as per the above formula.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Attributable incomes of CFCs that are retained and not repatriated to Pakistan are subject to tax on the basis of the tax rate applicable to dividends (i.e. 15%).
A company shall be classifiable as a CFC if:
There will be no tax incidence under these provisions in case the voting rights or capital held by the resident person is less than 10% or income of the CFC is less than PKR 10 million. Moreover, no further tax is payable at the time of actual distribution.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
The rates of tax for a branch of a company incorporated outside Pakistan are the same as those applicable on resident companies. Tax at the rate of 15% is levied on the transfer of after-tax profits by a branch to the head office, subject to certain exception.
Payments to a branch in Pakistan of a non-resident are subject to deduction of tax at source primarily on the same basis as a resident in the case of sale of goods, rendering of services, and execution of contracts.
Pakistan has presently executed agreements for avoidance of double taxation with 66 countries.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Tax credits and exemptions
The Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (i.e the local tax law) provides for exemptions of whole or part of tax, reduced applicable tax rates, inapplicability of certain provisions, and reduction in tax liability. These exemptions are either based on specific categories of taxpayers or for a specific time period.
Significant tax credits/exemptions under the local income tax law are provided as follows:
### Certain exemptions and concessions for ‘special technology zones’ (STZs)
Dividend income and long-term capital gains from investments in zone enterprises, as defined in the STZ Ordinance, by a venture capital fund is exempt for ten years commencing from issuance of licence by the authority to the zone enterprise.
Profits and gains from the development and operations of the zones by a zone developer, as defined in the STZ Ordinance, is exempt for ten years from the date of signing of the development agreement.
Profits and gains of zone enterprises, as defined in the STZ Ordinance, is exempt for ten years from the date of issuance of licence by the authority.
### Significant exemptions and tax credits withdrawn
The following exemptions and tax credits have been withdrawn:
## Small companies
A small company has been defined to mean a company that:
## Charitable donations credit
Companies are allowed a tax credit equivalent to 20% of their taxable income in respect of donations to:
Companies were earlier allowed a straight deduction against taxable income (up to 20% of taxable income) in case of donations made to certain approved institutions. Donations to these charitable institutes earlier eligible for direct deduction from income have now been transposed into the tax credit regime. As a result, the overall upper limit for tax break for the donors, in respect of charitable donations, has been reduced.
## Foreign tax credit
Where a resident taxpayer derives foreign-source income on which foreign income tax is paid within two years from the year in which it is derived, the taxpayer is allowed a tax credit equal to the lower of (i) the foreign income tax paid or (ii) the Pakistan tax payable in respect of that income. However, foreign tax paid is not refundable.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Special rules
Special rules are applicable for computation of income from exploration and production of petroleum, mineral deposits, insurance, builders and land developers, SMEs, and banking business.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In Pakistan, FATCA compliance is effective from 1 July 2014 for personal accounts and from 1 January 2015 for business accounts. The Central Bank in Pakistan has advised all financial institutions to complete the registration process with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a participating foreign financial institution (PFFI) to avoid negative repercussions of non-compliance with FATCA regulations.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
On 12 September 2016, Pakistan signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (‘Convention’) under the aegis of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as part of prevention of BEPS. BEPS refers to tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in national tax laws to shift profits to low or no tax locations. Accordingly, on the recommendations of the BEPS Action Plan, certain amendments have also been incorporated in the relevant fiscal laws in order to fulfil its obligations under the Convention.
Pursuant to the above Convention, the following agreements were signed by Pakistan:
Keeping in view these Conventions/Agreements, relevant fiscal laws have been amended/enacted to provide for the following:
The FBR issued a notification, S.R.O 405(I)/2021, dated 1 April 2021, for enforcing the OECD’s Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI). With this development, certain DTTs entered into by Pakistan were expected to be amended, subject to certain reciprocal actions by the respective treaty partners.
Consequent to the above, the FBR has released revised versions of certain DTTs as well.
The multilateral conventions are expected to bring about important changes to the DTTs covered by the MLI, including a new preamble, anti-treaty abuse measures, and more stringent rules on dividends, capital gains, and the definition of a PE. On the other hand, the MLI seeks to improve the dispute resolution process and provide for corresponding adjustments in case of transfer pricing primary adjustments, therefore easing the compliance burden.
## Treaty abuse/shopping
Tax authorities are empowered to disregard an entity or a corporate structure not having any economic substance or that entered into such as a part of a ‘tax avoidance scheme’, such expression being defined to mean a transaction entered into with the primary purposes of tax avoidance or ‘reduction in tax liability’. ‘Reduction in tax liability’, *inter alia*, includes within its scope that achieved as a result of availing benefit under a DTT.
Further, provisions of law granting an overriding status to treatment provided for in DTTs have also been qualified to the effect that any re-characterisation of income/transactions would not be ineffective on account of such provisions so that substance of the transaction forms the basis of taxation and no rescue is available on the basis of structure designed to avail treaty benefits.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
In order to implement the directives contained in the Convention, the FBR was earlier empowered to obtain information from banks/financial institutions regarding non-resident persons for the purposes of automatic exchange of information under bilateral agreements. In exercise of these provisions, the CRS has already been made part of the income tax law, by way of insertion in the relevant Income Tax Rules.
Under the CRS, tax authorities of countries that are signatory to the Convention/Information Exchange Agreements can share information with the FBR with respect to financial accounts (broadly meaning accounts maintained by banks/financial institutions, including custodial and depository accounts) in their jurisdiction held by Pakistani residents. Pakistan will also be able to provide corresponding information to the foreign tax authorities on accounts held by residents of jurisdiction in Pakistan.
The CRS requires the banks and other financial institutions to provide certain information or to undertake certain due diligence with respect to certain financial accounts. The CRS is aimed to reduce tax evasion by taxpayers using offshore financial accounts held both directly and indirectly through enhanced information sharing and collaboration.
The FBR has introduced compulsory enrolment of financial institutions. Furthermore, time lines have been specified for filing of CRS reports by the financial institutions with the FBR.

Any foreign-source salary received by a resident individual is exempt from tax in Pakistan if the individual has paid foreign income tax in respect of that salary.
Where a resident taxpayer derives foreign-source income chargeable to tax in Pakistan, in respect of which the taxpayer has paid foreign tax, the taxpayer is allowed a credit of an amount equal to the lesser of the foreign income tax paid or the Pakistan tax payable in respect of the income.
Foreign-source income of a resident who is not a citizen of Pakistan is exempt if the individual is resident only by virtue of employment and one’s presence in Pakistan does not exceed three years. This exemption does not apply in the case of income from a business established in Pakistan and foreign-source income that is brought into or received in Pakistan.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Taxable income is calculated under five different types of income, as follows:
## Employment income
Employee’s gross salary is Pakistan-source income and taxable in Pakistan if it is earned from employment exercised in Pakistan or if it is paid by or on behalf of the federal government, a provincial government, or a local authority.
Salary is the amount received by an employee from employment. It includes leave pay, payment in lieu of leave, overtime, bonuses, commissions, fees, gratuities, work condition supplements, monetary and non-monetary perquisites, any allowances, including those paid on a fixed basis or not exclusively spent on behalf of the employer, profits in lieu of or in addition to salary, pensions, annuities, and tax reimbursement. In addition, amounts or perquisites paid or provided by an associate of the employer, a third-party under an arrangement with the employer or associate of the employer, a past employer or a prospective employer, or payments to an associate of the employee are also to be considered as salary.
## Equity compensation
### Employee share scheme
The fair market value of the shares determined at the date of issue under an employee share scheme, including as a result of the exercise of an option or right to acquire the shares, as reduced by any consideration paid by the employee for the shares, shall be chargeable to tax as salary. However, where shares are issued to the employee subject to restriction on the transfer of such shares, no amount shall be included in salary of the employee until the earlier of the time the employee has a free right to transfer the shares or at the time when the employee disposes of the shares.
The value of the right or option to acquired shares under an employee share scheme is not chargeable to tax
### Stock options
An employee is taxed on the exercise of an option on the fair market value of the shares as reduced by the cost to the employee on acquisition. The gain on sale is taxed in the year of disposal, considering the fair market value at the time of exercise of the option as a cost of the employee.
## Foreign-source income of returning expatriates
Foreign-source income of returning expatriates (citizens of Pakistan who were not resident in Pakistan during any of the preceding four tax years) shall be exempt from tax in the tax year of return and the succeeding tax year.
## Income from property
Income from property for all taxpayers has been made subject to uniform taxation on a net income basis at the applicable rates. This means that the separate block rates for chargeability of tax on property income of individuals or AOPs are no longer applicable. In the case that rental income is computed on a net income basis, certain specific deductions are allowed, including expenditure for the purpose of administration and collection charges (up to a threshold of 4% of gross receipts).
WHT rates applicable in case of payment of rent of immovable property to individuals or AOPs are:
| Taxable income (PKR) | | Tax on column 1 (PKR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 300,000 |  | 0 |
| 300,000 | 600,000 |  | 5 |
| 600,000 | 2,000,000 | 15,000 | 10 |
| 2,000,000 |  | 155,000 | 25 |
These WHT rates shall increase by 100% in case the recipient of rental income is not an active taxpayer.
All payments made on account of rent of immovable properties shall be subject to the above WHT rates (if made to an individual or AOP), including in case of sub-lease.
Loss sustain under any heading of income is allowed to be set off against the person’s income under this heading.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale, exchange, or transfer of movable capital assets, except for securities traded at a stock exchange, are taxable at normal slab rates prescribed for individuals. Capital gain arising on these capital assets held for more than one year, which was earlier taxable to the extent of 75% of the total gain, is now fully taxable.
### Capital gain on immovable properties
The gain arising on the disposal of immovable property shall be computed as the consideration received on disposal of the asset less the cost of the asset and is subject to tax as follows:
#### Properties acquired on or after 1 July 2024
#### Properties acquired on or before 30 June 2024
Capital gains continue to be taxed at the applicable following slab rate on the basis of the respective holding period:
| Holding period | Tax (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open plots | Constructed property | Flats |
| Where the holding period does not exceed one year | 15.0 | 15.0 | 15.0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds one year but does not exceed two years | 12.5 | 10.0 | 7.5 |
| Where the holding period exceeds two years but does not exceed three years | 10.0 | 7.5 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds three years but does not exceed four years | 7.5 | 5.0 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds four years but does not exceed five years | 5.0 | 0 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds five years but does not exceed six years | 2.5 | 0 | 0 |
| Where the holding period exceeds six years | 0 | 0 | 0 |
Capital gains relating to disposal of immovable properties situated outside Pakistan will be taxed at applicable slab rates irrespective of holding period.
Purchase of immovable property exceeding PKR 5 million and any other asset exceeding PKR 1 million by way of other than a banking channel shall not be considered as an eligible cost for the purpose of computation of capital gain, and the related asset shall not be considered as an eligible depreciable asset. Moreover, such action would also invite penal consequences for the purchaser.
Purchase, sale, and transfer of immovable property is subject to advance tax at rates ranging from 3% to 4%, depending upon the gross consideration/fair market price of the immovable property. These rates are subject to increase in case buyer or seller are late filers / non-active taxpayers.
### Capital gain on securities
Gain on disposal of listed securities acquired on or after 1 July 2024 is as follows**:**
For securities acquired during the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2024 (both dates are inclusive), the capital gain continues to be taxed at the applicable following slab rate on the basis of the respective holding period:
| Holding period | Tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Less than one year | 15.0 |
| From one year to two years | 12.5 |
| From two years to three years | 10.0 |
| From three years to four years | 7.5 |
| From four years to five years | 5.0 |
| From five years to six years | 2.5 |
| More than six years | 0 |
The rate shall be 12.5%, irrespective of the holding period, for securities purchased on or before 30 June 2022. The rate shall be 0% for securities acquired before 1 July 2013.
A mutual fund, collective investment scheme, or real estate investment trust (REIT) scheme shall, at redemption of securities, deduct capital gain tax at a rate of 15% for stock funds in case of individual / AOP or a company. However, the rate shall be 25% for other funds in case of a company. In case of stock funds, if dividend receipts of the fund are less than capital gains, the rate of deduction shall be 15%. No tax shall be deducted if the holding period of a security is more than six years.
Loss on disposal of listed and other securities could earlier only be set off against capital gains (and not allowed to be carried forward). From tax year 2019 and onwards, such loss is now allowed to be carried forward and set off against future capital gains on such securities, up to a maximum of three tax years.
### Capital gain on disposal of Special Convertible Rupee Accounts (SCRAs) and Roshan Digital Accounts (RDAs)
Foreign companies (not having PE in Pakistan) and non-resident individuals investing in Pakistan in debt instruments and government securities through SCRAs and RDAs are subject to a blanket 10% WHT rate on capital gain arising on disposal of these debt instruments and government securities. This deduction shall be full and final discharge of their tax liability.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from a company (including mutual funds and real estate investment trusts [REITs], etc.) is generally subject to final tax at the rate of 15%; however, a different rate would apply in the following cases:
Tax at the above-mentioned rates is withheld on payments of dividend. The WHT rates shall increase by 100% in case recipient of dividend is a resident but inactive taxpayer.
## Interest income
Interest income of individuals is subject to final tax of 15% where the total income earned in a tax year does not exceeds PKR 5 million. Where the interest income exceeds PKR 5 million, it would be subject to tax at normal slab rates applicable for individual. Income tax withholding in the instant case is fixed at 15% (increased by 100% in case recipient of interest income is a resident but inactive taxpayer).
