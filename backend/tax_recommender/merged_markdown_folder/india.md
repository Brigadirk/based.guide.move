| Income | CIT rate (%) | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

\* Effective tax rates include surcharge and health and education cess. For resident companies, surcharge shall be applicable at the rate of 0%, 7%, or 12%, depending on total income. For non-resident companies, surcharge shall be applicable at the rate of 0%, 2%, or 5%, depending on total income. Further, health and education cess shall be levied at the rate of 4%, irrespective of amount of total income.
## Reduced rate of tax for certain existing domestic companies
A beneficial CIT rate of 22% (plus surcharge of 10% and applicable health and education cess of 4%) can be availed with effect from tax year 2019/20. This beneficial rate is at the option of the company and is applicable on satisfaction of the following conditions, cumulatively:
2. The company has not claimed set-off of loss and unabsorbed depreciation carried forward from any earlier years including set-off of any unabsorbed depreciation and losses relating to loss/depreciation on amalgamation, provided such loss is attributable to the deductions referred to in (i) above. However, the corresponding adjustment in written down value of such block of asset as on 1 April 2019 will be allowed in the prescribed manner.
3. The option of seeking the benefit of a reduced CIT rate of 22% is furnished in the prescribed manner before the due date of furnishing of income.
4. Companies exercising this option have been excluded from the applicability of provisions of minimum alternate tax (MAT) and MAT credit.
Benefit of the above provision of reduced tax rate will not be available in the year of non-compliance and all the subsequent years and other provisions of the Income-tax Act will apply as if the option has not been exercised from the year of non-compliance.
## Reduced rate of tax for newly set-up domestic manufacturing companies and companies engaged in generation of electricity
A beneficial CIT rate of 15% (plus surcharge of 10% and applicable health and education cess of 4%) with effect from tax year 2019/20 for newly set-up domestic manufacturing companies can be availed. The benefit of concessional tax rate of 15% has been extended to domestic companies engaged in the business of generation of electricity from tax year 2020/21.
The beneficial rate of 15% (plus surcharge of 10% and applicable health and education cess) can be exercised at the option of the company and is applicable on satisfaction of the following conditions, cumulatively:
1. The company is incorporated on or after 1 October 2019 and commences manufacture or production of any article or thing on or before 31 March 2024.
2. The 'business' is not formed by splitting up or reconstruction of business already in existence (exception provided for undertaking formed as a result of re-establishment, reconstruction, or revival of business).

The company has not claimed set-off of loss and unabsorbed depreciation carried forward from any earlier years, including set-off of any unabsorbed depreciation and losses relating to loss/depreciation on amalgamation, provided such loss is attributable to the deductions referred to in (vi) above.
8. In case difficulty arises in non-fulfilment of certain conditions in this section, the Indian Revenue Department may issue guidelines for removing the difficulty.
9. The option of seeking the benefit of a reduced CIT rate of 15% is furnished in the prescribed manner before the due date of furnishing of income.
10. Domestic transfer pricing provision will be applicable for these companies.
11. Companies exercising this option have been excluded from the applicability of provisions of MAT and MAT credit.
Benefit of the above provision of reduced tax rate will not be available in the year of non-compliance and all the subsequent years and other provisions of the Income-tax Act will apply as if the option has not been exercised from the year of non-compliance. However, such company may exercise an option to be governed under provisions of reduced tax rate of 22% (plus surcharge of 10% and applicable health and education cess).
## Minimum alternative tax (MAT)
Companies exercising the option of a lower tax rate of 22% (*discussed above*) have been excluded from the applicability of provisions of MAT and MAT credit.
Companies that continue to pay taxes under the existing tax regime (not exercising the option under the alternative tax regime as discussed above) are liable to pay MAT on their adjusted book profits (other than income from life insurance business) where the tax liability under the normal provisions (excluding surcharge and health and education cess) of the Income-tax Act for the tax year is not more than 15% (excluding surcharge and health and education cess) of such book profits.
MAT credit is the amount paid over and above the normal tax liability, which can be carried forward and can be utilised for 15 years. However, MAT credit to the extent of difference between the foreign tax credits allowed against MAT over such credit allowable against the tax under the other provisions of the Income-tax Act will not be eligible to be carried forward.
MAT provisions are not applicable to foreign companies that do not have a PE in India. However, MAT provisions will not apply to foreign companies where their total income is solely derived from shipping business, exploration of mineral oils, business of aircraft, civil construction in turnkey projects and income thereon is offered to tax as per specific provisions provided under the Income-tax Act.
The existing tax rates under MAT are provided in the below table:
| Income | MAT rate (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Indian company | | Foreign company (other than exempted) | |
| Basic\* | Effective\*\* | Basic\* | Effective\*\* |
| Less than INR 10 million | 15 | 15.600 | 15 | 15.600 |
| More than INR 10 million but less than INR 100 million | 15 | 16.692 | 15 | 15.912 |
| More than INR 100 million | 15 | 17.472 | 15 | 16.380 |
\* Basic rate of MAT is 9% of book profits in case of a corporate and non-corporate taxpayer located in an International Financial Services Centre and deriving income solely in convertible foreign exchange.
\*\* Effective tax rates include surcharge and health and education cess. For resident companies, surcharge shall be applicable at the rate of 0%, 7%, or12%, depending on total income. For non-resident companies, surcharge shall be applicable at the rate of 0%, 2%, or 5%, depending on total income. Further, health and education cess shall be levied at the rate of 4%, irrespective of amount of total income.
## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial taxes on income in India at present.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Taxable period
The Indian tax year is from 1 April to 31 March.
## Tax returns
An individual is required to file a separate return of income. Joint filing is not permitted. Husband and wife are treated as separate and independent individuals for the purposes of Indian income tax.
An individual engaged in a business or profession is required to have the books of account audited under the tax laws if the turnover/total sales/gross receipts exceeds INR 10 million in the case of a business or where the gross receipts exceed INR 5 million in the case of a profession.
The due date for individuals to file their tax returns is 31 July of the year immediately following the relevant tax year. In cases where the individual is required to have one's books of account audited under the tax laws, the due date is 31 October of the immediately following the relevant tax year. However, a belated/revised return can also be filed by 31 December, after close of the relevant tax year.
In cases where tax returns are filed after the due date, a late fee of INR 5,000 will be levied. However, in case taxable income does not exceed INR 500,000, this fee will not exceed INR 1,000.
Individuals who are 80 years old or more and qualify as RORs of India have an option to file their tax returns manually. It is mandatory to file the return electronically if:
To e-file the return, taxpayers have been using digital signatures for paperless filing, or could opt to forward the details of the e-filed return to the Central Processing Centre. Now, the government has announced a paperless way of e-filing of tax returns *via* Electronic Verification Code (EVC). The EVC is a 10-digit alpha-numeric code that is unique for each Permanent Account Number (PAN) and is generated for the purpose of electronic verification of the person in the e-filing website.
### Mandatory furnishing of return of income
It is mandatory to file a return of income in the following cases:
Resident senior citizens (aged 75 years or more) having only pension and bank interest income from the specified bank are exempted from the return filing requirement, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.
## Payment of tax
Final income tax payment will be made on or before the due date of filing of the income-tax return.
Further, if the taxpayer’s estimated tax liability (for the current tax year) after reducing withholding tax/foreign tax credit is likely to exceed INR 10,000, then the taxpayer must pay advance tax during the tax year on the basis of estimated income in four instalments: by 15 June (15% of the estimated annual tax liability), by 15 September (45% of the estimated annual tax liability), by 15 December (75% of the estimated annual tax liability), and by 15 March of the tax year (100% of the estimated annual tax liability). Resident senior citizens are exempted from the requirement of advance tax payments unless they have income from a business or profession.
### Withholding tax
An individual may not be required to withhold tax from payments he/she makes. However, in certain cases, an individual (engaged in business or profession) is required to withhold tax if he/ she is liable for audit under the tax law in the tax year immediately preceding the tax year in which the payment is made. In case of many other payments, the tax laws require a payer to withhold tax from the payment and deposit the same into the Indian Government Treasury within specified timelines. Such payers are also required to obtain a Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) once, and file periodic returns of tax withheld.
Similarly, where the individual is making payment of rent to a resident in excess of INR 50,000 per month, he/she is liable to withhold tax on such payment at the rate of 5% in the last month of the tax year or last month of tenancy, whichever is earlier. With effect from 1 October 2024, such rate would be reduced to 2%.
Any transfer of immovable property (any land, building, or part of a building) to a resident will attract a withholding tax of 1% of the agreed consideration or stamp duty value (whichever is higher) if the consideration and stamp duty value or value for a transfer is INR 5 million or more. This consideration includes all charges of the nature of club membership fee, car parking fee, electricity and water facility fee, maintenance fee, advance fee, or any charge of similar nature that are incidental to transfer of the immovable property. The withholding tax provisions will not apply in cases of transfer of agricultural land.
An employer is required to withhold tax from salaries at the time of payment of salary and deposit the same into the Government Treasury by the seventh day of the month following the month in which tax is withheld, except for the month of March, when the tax can be deposited on or before 30 April. An employer will obtain evidence from the employees in the prescribed form and manner. This is aimed to curb the practices followed by companies of allowing deductions/exemptions on the basis of mere declaration by the employees.
Currently, the employer is not allowed to consider the tax collected at source (TCS) as a credit for calculating tax due on the salary income. This has resulted in cash flow issues to the employees. With effect from 1 October 2024, the employer will also consider TCS while computing the net tax due on salary income.
Also, currently, there is no specific provision that allows the parent of a minor to avail the TCS collected in the name of a minor. With effect from 1 January 2025, the parent of a minor, in whose tax return the minor's income is included, will be allowed to avail oneself of the credit for the TCS deducted in the minor's name.
Interest at 1% per month or part of the month is levied on the employer in case of a delay in deduction. Interest at 1.5% per month or part of the month is levied in case there is a delay in deposition of the taxes so deducted.
## Black Money Taxation Act
The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 (the Black Money Taxation Act) covers all persons who were ROR in India, in accordance with provision of the Income-tax Act, either in the tax year to which the income relates or in the tax year in which the undisclosed asset located outside India was acquired. Any undisclosed foreign income or assets detected are to be taxed at the rate of 30% under the Black Money Taxation Act. Non-disclosure or inaccurate disclosure will attract a penalty of INR 1 million and may attract imprisonment of up to seven years. In addition, there is a provision for penalty of 300% of tax and imprisonment of up to ten years in case of wilful attempt to evade taxes on foreign income/assets.
With effect from 1 October 2024, a penalty will not be levied where an individual omits reporting assets (other than immovable property) valued at INR 2 million or less.
## Restriction on cash transactions
No person will receive an amount of INR 200,000 or more in (i) aggregate from a person in a day, (ii) respect of a single transaction, or (iii) respect of transactions relating to one event or occasion from a person. A person will have to transact for amounts above the prescribed limit by way of an account payee cheque or account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system through a bank account. The provision will not apply in case of:
A penalty will be levied on a person who receives a sum in contravention of provisions, and the penalty will be equal to the amount of such receipt. However, the penalty will not be levied if the person proves that there were good and sufficient reasons for such contravention.
In order to further discourage cash transactions and move towards less cash economy, a new provision was inserted attracting a 2% tax deducted at source on cash payments in excess of INR 10 million in aggregate made during the year by a banking company or cooperative bank or post office to any person from an account maintained by the recipient. Effective 1 July 2020, in case a person who has not filed the return of income for three tax years immediately preceding the relevant tax year in which the withdrawals are made and for which the due date for filing the tax return has expired, tax will be deducted at 2% on withdrawals exceeding INR 2 million or 5% if such withdrawals exceed INR 10 million.
## Tax audit process
### Audit for income-tax purposes
Persons carrying on business are required to get their books of account audited for income-tax purposes if the business turnover exceeds INR 10 million. For individuals opting for the presumptive taxation scheme, one will not be required to get one’s accounts audited if the total turnover or gross receipts of the relevant previous year does not exceed INR 20 million. This has been effective from tax year 2017/18 onwards. For persons carrying on a profession, crossing the turnover threshold of INR 5 million will attract the requirement to have its books of accounts audited from 1 April 2017. The penalty for non-compliance with this audit requirement is INR 150,000, subject to 0.5% of total turnover/gross receipts.
### Special audit
Tax authorities, at any stage of proceedings, having regard to the nature, complexity, and volume of accounts or doubts on correctness of accounts or other reasons, may, after taking necessary approval of the Chief Commissioner, direct a taxpayer to get its accounts audited and to furnish the report.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations under the Income-tax Act for submission of tax returns (other than amended or updated tax returns) is nine months from the end of the relevant tax year, and for assessment of returns filed is 12 months (time limit to be increased by another 12 months in case transfer pricing provisions are applicable) from the end of the relevant tax year for which the return is filed. The statute of limitations for reassessment ranges from four to eleven years from the end of the relevant tax year.
### Faceless assessment
With a view to roll out e-assessment across the country so as to impart greater transparency and accountability, the Central Government was empowered to notify a scheme for scrutiny assessments to achieve the desired purpose. The scope of e-assessment has been extended to include best judgement assessment and reassessment as well. Similar e-proceedings have been introduced in respect of:
## General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
GAAR provisions were introduced by the Finance Act, 2017 and have been applicable since 1 April 2017. These provisions empower the tax department to declare an ‘arrangement’, or any part or step thereof, entered into by a taxpayer with the main purpose of obtaining tax benefit to be an 'Impermissible Avoidance Agreement' (IAA), the consequence of which would be denial of tax benefit under the Income-tax Act or under the applicable tax treaty.
For GAAR provisions, an IAA means the main purpose of which is to obtain a tax benefit, and it:
The following are consequences if an arrangement is regarded as an IAA:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
Taxation of individuals in India is primarily based on their residential status in the relevant tax year. The residential status of individuals is determined independently for each tax year and is ascertained on the basis of their physical presence in India during the relevant tax year and past years. *See the [Residence](india/individual/residence.html) section for more information*.
The following types of residential status are envisaged for an individual:
Under Indian tax laws, the scope of taxation differs as per the residential status of an individual:
RNOR and NR individuals are not subject to tax in respect to their income earned and received outside of India.
## Personal income tax rates
### Alternate personal tax regime (APTR)
Effective 1 April 2024, i.e. tax year 2025/26, the tax rates under the ATPR, devoid of any deductions or exemptions, have been revised as follows:
| Taxable income (INR) | | Tax on column 1 (INR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 300,000 | - | 0 |
| 300,000 | 700,000 | - | 5 |
| 700,000 | 1,000,000 | 20,000 | 10 |
| 1,000,000 | 1,200,000 | 50,000 | 15 |
| 1,200,000 | 1,500,000 | 80,000 | 20 |
| 1,500,000 |  | 140,000 | 30 |
Under the APTR, the taxpayer is not eligible to claim certain exemptions/deductions/set-off of losses/carryforward of losses, such as:
Note that this is not an exhaustive list and just an overview of certain deduction/exemptions that are not allowed in the APTR.
The APTR option can be exercised for every financial year (FY) if the taxpayer has no business income. If the taxpayer has business income, the option, once exercised, will be mandatory for all subsequent financial years as well, with only a one-time change being permitted later.
The Revenue Department has clarified that the employer will seek information from each of its employees having salary income regarding their intended tax regime, and each such employee will intimate the same to the employer. Upon intimation, the employer will compute the total income and deduct tax at source thereon according to the option exercised.
If intimation is not made by the employee, it will be presumed that the employee continues to be in the default tax regime and has not exercised the option to opt out of the alternate tax regime.
It is also clarified that the employee can elect to change the option of the tax regime at the time of filing one's India tax return.
### Old tax regime
The slab rates applicable to individuals for tax year 2022/23 are as follows:
| Taxable income (INR) | | Tax on column 1 (INR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 250,000 | - | 0 |
| 250,000 | 500,000 | - | 5 |
| 500,000 | 1,000,000 | 12,500 | 20 |
| 1,000,000 |  | 112,500 | 30 |
The basic exemption limit for resident individuals who are 60 years of age or more but less than 80 years of age at any time during the tax year is INR 300,000. For resident individuals who are 80 years of age or more, it is INR 500,000.
## Surcharge
In addition to the income tax, a surcharge is to be levied where the total income of individuals exceeds INR 5 million, as follows:
| Taxable income (INR) | Surcharge (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 5 million | 0 |
| Above 5 million but up to 10 million | 10 |
| Above 10 million but up to 20 million | 15 |
| Above 20 million but up to 50 million | 25 |
| Above 50 million | 25 (37 in case old tax regime is opted) |
However, on income arising on account of long-term capital gains, the rate of surcharge would be capped at 15%.
## Health and education cess
Health and education cess at the rate of 4% of the income tax and surcharge (if applicable) will be levied to compute the effective tax rate of individuals.
## Tax rebate
Resident individuals are eligible for a tax rebate of the lower of the income tax or INR 12,500 where the total income does not exceed INR 500,000. However, in case the alternate tax regime is exercised, tax rebate would be the lower of the income tax or INR 25,000 where the total income does not exceed INR 700,000.
## COVID-19 reliefs
## Alternative minimum tax (AMT)
AMT is applicable to all persons, other than a company, having income from a business or profession. AMT means an amount of tax that is computed on the adjusted total income. The taxpayer is liable to pay tax on such income at a rate of 18.5% (plus surcharge and health and education cess) on the adjusted total income. For a person located in an international financial services centre deriving income solely in convertible foreign exchange, one shall be liable to pay tax on such income at the rate of 9% (plus surcharge and health and education cess). AMT paid in a year is eligible to be carried forward for set-off against normal tax liability for 15 years. In case of an individual, Hindu undivided family (HUF), an association of persons, a body of individuals, or an artificial juridical person, AMT is not applicable where the adjusted total income does not exceed INR 2 million.
## Local taxes on income
Profession taxes imposed by certain states on individuals are minimal and deductible while calculating taxable income.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Social security contributions
Indian social security is broadly governed by the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (PF Act) and schemes made thereunder, namely the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme (EPF) and the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS). The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), a statutory body established by the government of India, administers social security regulations in India.
Currently, Indian social security regulations apply mandatorily to an establishment in India employing 20 or more persons or where an establishment voluntarily seeks registration with the authorities. Employees (including foreign nationals) working with an establishment in India to which the PF Act applies are liable to contribute towards the provident fund at the fixed rate of 12% of salary. The employer is required to make the matching contribution and deposit both the employer’s and employee’s contributions (i.e. 24%) to the provident fund of the employee by the 15th day of the following month.
Out of the employer’s contribution of 12%, an amount equal to 8.33% of salary (salary capped at INR 15,000 per month in respect of Indian employees) is allocated to the pension fund of the employee.
### International worker
The government of India made the social security scheme mandatory for cross-border workers. A foreign national qualifies as an ‘international worker’ if he/she is coming to work for an establishment in India to which the PF Act applies.
Similarly, an Indian national qualifies as an ‘international worker’ if he/she has worked or is going to work in a country with which India has entered into a social security agreement (SSA) and is eligible to avail benefits under the social security program of the host country, according to the terms of the relevant SSA. However, it has been clarified that Indian employees holding a certificate of coverage (COC)/detachment certificate, obtained from Indian social security authorities and contributing to the Indian social security schemes, will not become international workers and will continue to be treated like any other domestic Indian employees. Also, Indian employees qualifying as international workers on account of working/having worked in a country with which India has an SSA will re-acquire the status of Indian employees upon repatriation to India after completion of overseas assignment. Accordingly, such employees will not be subject to the special provisions applicable to international workers after repatriating to India.
### Exemption
An international worker from a country with which India has an SSA in force is exempted from Indian social security where he or she:
Similarly, an international worker from a country with which India has entered into a bilateral comprehensive economic agreement prior to 1 October 2008 is exempted from Indian social security where:
To amend and consolidate a majority of Indian labour laws, the following four labour codes have been passed by the Parliament of India, which subsumes and amalgamates 29 different central labour laws legislations:
There are several changes, ranging from reclassification of workforce to changes in the definition of salary for employees’ benefit and other matters.
The Ministry of Labour and Employment of India has deferred the implementation of the above four codes.
### Other issues
## Goods and services tax (GST)
## Wealth taxes
There are no wealth taxes in India.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no inheritance tax in India.
There is no gift tax liability on the donor. However, any sum of money aggregating to INR 50,000 or more received during the relevant tax year without consideration or for an inadequate consideration by an individual from any person not being a relative (see below for details) is subject to income tax in the hands of the recipient.
Similarly, the following receipts are also subject to tax:
Further, the same are not considered as taxable if received at the time of marriage, under a will/inheritance, in contemplation of death of the payer, or through any other criteria specified in the law.
## Property taxes
Property tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The rate of tax levied varies from city to city in India and is generally related to the prevailing market prices for property in each locality.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains from the disposal of capital assets are liable to tax in the tax year in which such assets are sold or transferred. Capital assets include all forms of property, stocks and shares, land and buildings, goodwill, etc. (but exclude personal effects except stock-in-trade, stores, and raw materials held for business purposes). Jewellery also forms part of capital assets.
### Categorising capital gains
Earlier capital assets held for more than 36 months (12 months in the case of securities [other than units] listed on a recognised stock exchange in India, units of the Unit Trust of India, units of equity-oriented mutual funds, and zero-coupon bonds; 24 months for immovable property or unlisted shares) are termed as ‘long-term capital assets’, and the assets not so held are called ‘short-term capital assets’. However, from 23 July 2024, capital assets held for more than 24 months immediately preceding the date of its transfer (12 months in the case of securities (including units) listed on a recognised stock exchange in India, units of the Unit Trust of India, units of equity-oriented mutual funds, and zero-coupon bonds) will be termed as ‘long-term capital assets’.
Capital gains arising from the transfer/disposal of long-term capital assets are called 'long-term capital gains'. Gains arising from the disposal of short-term capital assets are called 'short-term capital gains'. This distinction is important as long-term capital gains are taxed or treated beneficially and there are also planning opportunities to save taxes provided the consideration or gain is re-invested, subject to fulfilment of certain other conditions.
Long-term capital gains are subject to tax at prescribed beneficial rates (plus applicable surcharge and health and education cess). Short-term capital gains are added to the taxable income of the individual and subject to tax at normal slab rates.
### Computation of long-term capital gains
Except in case of debentures and bonds (other than capital indexed bonds issued by Government/Sovereign Gold Bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India), the cost of acquisition of long-term capital assets is determined after indexing costs by a prescribed inflation factor (known as ‘indexed cost of acquisition’). The base year for computation of indexed cost of acquisition is 2001. Assets acquired before 1 April 2001 can be taken at actual cost or FMV as on 1 April 2001 at the option of the taxpayer. However, effective 1 April 2020, in case of capital asset being land or building or both, the FMV of such asset on 1 April 2001 will not exceed the stamp duty value, wherever applicable, of such asset as on 1 April 2001.
In case of an NR where shares or debentures of an Indian company are purchased by utilising foreign currency, the subsequent capital gains are determined by computing the gains in the same foreign currency in which it was purchased and reconverting the gains into Indian rupees to calculate the tax payable on the same.
However, there are a few exceptions for indexation and rate of tax on long-term capital gains/short-term capital gains:
For transfer/disposal of capital assets on or after 23 July 2024, the rate of tax has been increased to 12.5% and the non-taxable amount has been increased to INR 125,000.
For transaction of sale effective 1 April 2018 in respect of above-mentioned capital assets already held from a date prior to 31 January 2018, the cost of acquisition would be determined as the higher of the following:
- FMV as of 31 January 2018.
- The full value of consideration arising on transfer.
The surcharge rate of 25%/37% will not apply to capital gains arising on sale of equity share of a listed company or a unit of an equity oriented mutual fund or unit of business trust. The enhanced surcharge rates of 25%/37% will also not apply to the income of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) arising from securities prescribed under the Income-tax Act.
Moreover, on income arising on account of long-term capital gains on all the capital assets, the rate of surcharge will be 15%.
For NRs, the basic exemption limit of INR 250,000 does not apply against the gains earned on sale of such shares/units.
Tax liability on long-term capital gains can be reduced by taking benefit of exemptions provided in the Income-tax Act when gains/sale proceeds from the sale of the capital assets are reinvested into house property and/or prescribed investments. Effective 1 April 2023, benefit claimed on long-term capital gains arising from transfer of capital asset where gains are re-invested in a residential house has been restricted to INR 100 million.
Short-term capital losses can be offset against any capital gains (long-term or short-term). Long-term capital loss can only be offset against long-term capital gains. Unabsorbed capital losses (short-term or long-term) can be carried forward for a maximum of eight years to be offset only against future capital gains as mentioned above.
To raise funds for the Start-up Action Plan, the government has provided an exemption from long-term capital gains on the sale of any long-term capital asset if the sale consideration is invested in units of a specified fund. The specified fund will be notified by the Central Government in due course, and the maximum deduction available will be INR 5 million. The investments should be held for a minimum period of three years to avail the exemption.
Effective 1 April 2019, a once in a lifetime option has been given to an individual/HUF wherein long-term capital gains (up to INR 20 million) arising from transfer of a residential property can now be reinvested in two house properties in India. Further, an individual/HUF selling a residential property also has the option to reinvest the long-term capital gains by subscribing to shares of a company that qualifies as a small or medium enterprise and in shares of eligible start-ups with no cap on reinvestment of the capital gain. Investments under this provision can be made up to 31 March 2022. In case the eligible start-up is a technology driven start-up, it will be entitled to utilise the proceeds of such equity shares in computers or computer software.
On account of transaction in immovable property, any income earned is either taxed under income from capital gains or income from other sources. The income is taxed on the basis of the sale consideration or stamp duty value, whichever is higher. In case the sale consideration is less than the stamp duty value, the differential is taxed as income from other sources. However, effective 1 April 2020, in case of sale, no such adjustments will be made in cases where the difference between stamp duty value and sale consideration is not more than 10% of such sale consideration. In case of purchase, if the variation between stamp duty value and sale consideration does not exceed INR 50,000 or 10% of sale consideration, no addition is to be made to total income.
The above limit has been enhanced from 10% to 20% in relation to immovable property acquired during the period 12 November 2020 to 30 June 2021 by way of first-time allotment from a real estate developer for a consideration up to INR 20 million.
## Securities transaction tax (STT)
STT is applicable to transactions involving purchase/sale of equity shares, derivatives, units of equity-oriented funds through a recognised stock exchange, or purchase/sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to any mutual fund. The STT leviable for such transactions varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based.
## Buyback of shares
An additional tax is payable on transactions involving buyback of shares by Indian companies from its shareholders. A tax at 20% (plus surcharge at 12% and health and education cess at 4%) is payable by the company on the difference of consideration paid on buyback and the issue price of shares. The Revenue Department has prescribed the methodology for determination of amount received for issue of shares under different situations, being a subject matter of tax on buyback. The buyback consideration received will be tax exempt in the hands of the receiver. No tax credit will be allowed in case of such taxes paid either to the company or to the shareholder.
With effect from 1 October 2024, consideration received under buyback is proposed to be taxed as deemed dividend in the hands of the shareholders. Moreover, no deduction for expenses shall be available to the shareholder against such deemed dividend. Additionally, the amount originally invested in the shares being bought back would be available as a capital loss and shall be available for set-off against the future capital gain from sale of shares or otherwise.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Taxable period
In India, the tax year begins on 1 April and ends on 31 March.
## Tax returns
Accounts for tax purposes must be made up to 31 March. For persons having business/professional income, the income tax return is required to be filed electronically on or before 31 October of the succeeding tax year. In case the transfer pricing provisions are applicable, the due date for filing of the tax return is on or before 30 November.
In case a taxpayer desires to revise its filed return of income, it would be eligible to do so only up to 31 December of the year following the tax year or before the completion of assessment, whichever is earlier. Updated tax returns can be filed within 24 months from the end of the tax year.
Further, to claim certain tax incentives/deductions, taxpayers have to furnish their tax returns on or before the due date specified for filing the tax returns.
### Quarterly WHT returns
Quarterly statements of taxes withheld are required to be filed electronically with the tax authorities on or before 31 July, 31 October, and 31 January for the first three quarters of the tax year and on or before 31 May following the last quarter of the tax year.
### Obligation to submit tax return for assets located outside India
A resident taxpayer having any asset (including financial interest in any entity) located outside India or signing authority in any account located outside India is mandatorily required to furnish a tax return.
### Exempting non-resident from filing tax returns in certain conditions
A relief is granted to non-resident taxpayers/foreign companies by exempting them from filing a return of income in India whose total income consists of royalties or fees for technical services.
Thus, non-resident taxpayer companies will not be required to furnish their tax returns in India if the following conditions are satisfied:
However, relief may not be available to non-residents whose taxes will be deducted at the beneficial rates provided under the respective tax treaties. This is effective from 1 April 2020 and will accordingly apply to tax year 2020/21 onwards.
## Payment of tax
Tax is payable in advance (if tax payable for the year exceeds INR 10,000) in specified instalments for every quarter on or before 15 June, 15 September, and 15 December for the first three quarters of the tax year and on or before 15 March for the last quarter of the tax year. Any balance of tax due on the basis of the return must be paid on a self-assessment basis before the return is filed. A tax return will be treated as defective if the tax liability along with interest is not paid on or before the date of submission of the tax return. Interest levied for default in payment of advance tax is computed beginning from the first day of the year following the tax year to the date of the assessment order.
## Tax Assessment – Timelines
### Assessment timelines
Timelines for issuance of notice and passing order under the Indian Income-tax Act are as follows:
| Compliance | Timeline |
| --- | --- |
| Processing of tax return (intimation). | Nine months from end of relevant financial year. |
| Selection of tax return for assessment. | Three months from end of financial year in which tax return is filed. |
| Completion of assessment for tax year 2022/23 and onwards\*. | 12 months from end of relevant tax year. |
\* Where the case is referred to the transfer pricing officer, the timelines are extended by 12 months.
### Reassessment timelines
### Faceless assessment
With a view to roll out e-assessment across the country so as to impart greater transparency and accountability, the Central Government was empowered to notify a scheme for scrutiny assessments to achieve the desired purpose. The scope of e-assessment has been extended to include best judgement assessment and reassessment as well. Further, similar e-proceedings have been introduced in respect of:
## General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
GAAR provisions were introduced by the Finance Act, 2017 and have been applicable since 1 April 2017. These provisions empower the tax department to declare an ‘arrangement’, or any part or step thereof, entered into by a taxpayer with the main purpose of obtaining tax benefit to be an 'Impermissible Avoidance Agreement' (IAA), the consequence of which would be denial of tax benefit under the Income-tax Act or under the applicable tax treaty.
For GAAR provisions, an IAA means the main purpose of which is to obtain a tax benefit, and it:
The following are consequences if an arrangement is regarded as an IAA:

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Goods and services tax (GST)
GST is an indirect tax, which is a transaction-based taxation regime, that has been in effect in India since 1 July 2017.
Multiple indirect taxes (except customs duty) have been subsumed within GST, and there is one single tax applicable on supply of goods and services. However, there are a few products that continue to be outside the ambit of GST, such as petrol, diesel, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), natural gas, alcohol for human consumption, and crude oil.
For smooth GST operation, the government has formed a GST Council, which consists of the State Finance Ministers representing their states. The GST Council provides recommendations to the government on various aspects of GST law, such as rate revisions and amendments in GST rules, issuance of notifications, circulars, etc.
### GST regime
GST is a comprehensive ‘consumption tax’ levied on the supply of all goods and services. Indian GST is a dual model:
In case of intra-state supply of goods and services, CGST+SGST/UTGST would become applicable, and in case of inter-state supply of goods and services, Integrated GST (IGST) would become applicable. IGST is a sum of CGST and SGST/UTGST. The rate of GST varies from 5% to 28% depending upon the category of goods and services being supplied or procured, the general rate of tax being 18% for the majority of supplies. Additionally, some categories of goods/services, such as vehicles, aerated beverages, etc., notified by the government are subject to compensation cess under GST. Apart from the applicable GST rates, the government also imposes cess on certain products, such as sale of cars, soft beverages, etc.
The threshold limit for the purpose of obtaining GST registration is INR 2 million aggregate turnover in a financial year (INR 1 million for some special category states, such as the North-Eastern states). For the purpose of the threshold, aggregate turnover will be computed on a PAN-India basis. For some specific categories of supplies and suppliers, the registration requirement is mandatory.
However, the threshold for obtaining GST registration by a person who is engaged in exclusive intra-state supply of goods is INR 4 million aggregate turnover in a financial year, except in some specified cases.
Also, for some special category states making supply of goods/services (*viz.* Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand), the threshold limit has increased from INR 1 million to INR 2 million. For other special category states, the threshold continues to be INR 1 million.
Similar to previous VAT laws, there is a concept of composition scheme under GST for small traders. Small traders having turnover of INR 10 million have an option to avail a composition scheme. Under the said scheme, GST at a lower rate (1% of the taxable turnover for manufacturers/traders and 5% in case of restaurants) would apply. The option to avail such a scheme restricts the admissibility to avail input credit.
Further, the option to pay tax under a composition scheme has been extended to services, except for the following:
### Import of goods and services
The import of goods under the GST regime will be subject to IGST and compensation cess (if applicable), along with basic custom duty (BCD) and social welfare surcharge (up to 10% levied on the BCD). BCD and social welfare surcharge paid at the time of imports are not available as credit under GST; consequently, they will always be a cost to the importer.
Similar to erstwhile service tax laws, on import of service, service recipient would be liable to pay IGST under reverse charge. Also, there are specified categories of goods and services notified by the government on which GST needs to be paid by the recipient under reverse charge such as legal services, Goods Transport Agency services, etc.
Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) *vide* Notification Nos. 11/2023, 12/2023, and 13/2023, dated 26 September 2023, has exempted the importers from paying IGST on ocean freight in cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) contracts. This is pursuant to the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in the matter of Mohit Minerals.
### Zero-rated supplies/export of goods and services
Export of goods and services are zero rated under GST. Exporters can claim refund of input tax credit (ITC) of inputs/input services used in export of goods/services, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions. To claim the zero rate on exports, there is a requirement to file a bond/Letter of Undertaking (LUT) to the jurisdictional tax authorities at the beginning of each financial year. Alternatively, the exporter can pay tax on output and claim refund for the same.
Also, the supplies to an SEZ for authorised operations have been made zero rated under GST. Unlike the erstwhile indirect tax regime, which involved a lot of paperwork to claim export refund claims, a simplified online process to claim refund of exports has been specified under GST. The taxpayer is required to file a refund application and submit the relevant documents online on the GST portal.
To facilitate trade for smaller exporters, the concept of 'merchant exporter' has been introduced under GST. Accordingly, the merchant exporters will now have to pay nominal GST of 0.1% for procuring goods from domestic suppliers for export, subject to specified conditions.
Some clarifications issued by the government in relation to claiming refunds are as follows:
### Input tax credit (ITC)
As per the ITC provisions stipulated under GST law, a registered taxable person is eligible to claim ITC of such goods and services that are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of business. However, there is a specified list of goods and services mentioned below where credit will not be available under GST:
Having said the above, the ITC of goods and services that are obligatory for an employer to provide to its employees, under any law for the time being in force, is allowed.
Under GST, taxpayers are allowed to take ITC and utilise the same for payment of output tax liability. However, no ITC on account of CGST can be utilised towards payment of SGST/UTGST and *vice versa*. The credit IGST credit needs to be first utilised towards payment of output IGST liability. The IGST credit can be utilised to offset CGST/SGST or UTGST output liability, as the case may be, in any order.
#### Procedure for ITC availment
Also, it is pertinent to note that the credit pool is state-specific (i.e. IGST, CGST, and SGST of one state cannot be used to offset output of IGST, CGST, and SGST liability of another state).
### Compliance
#### Monthly returns
There are three monthly returns for a normal taxpayer under GST:
The government has notified a requirement to file monthly Form GSTR-3B (to be filed by the 20th day of the succeeding month).
Further, filing of Forms GSTR-2 and GSTR-3 continues to be suspended by the government.
The government had proposed to implement a new GST return system. The existing returns Form GSTR 1/GSTR 3B would be revamped in lines with the new format. However, this has currently been kept in abeyance (i.e. the existing system of Forms GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B is to continue).
#### Annual return
There is a requirement to file a GST annual return by 31 December of the succeeding financial year. Also, along with a GST annual return, suppliers whose turnover exceeds INR 50 million in a financial year are required to file a GST Audit Report by 31 December of the succeeding financial year.
### Key updates
#### Compliance related
| Aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year | Number of digits of HSN code |
| --- | --- |
| Below INR 50 million | 4 (not required for B2C invoices) |
| Above INR 50 million | 6 |
Such ineligible credit is to be permanently reversed and reported within Table-4B (1) of Form GSTR-3B.
Till the time of the availment of such input credit within Form GSTR-3B return, such input credit is carried forward with the pool of the total credit.
#### Clarifications
However, post the 52nd Council meeting, the government had stated that transmission of ITC through ISD would gradually be made mandatory. This provision has not been notified as yet.
#### SEZ-related updates
#### Concept of e-invoicing under GST
The government introduced an e-invoicing system under GST laws with effect from 1 October 2021. A summary of the key aspects of the proposed e-invoicing system is briefly explained below.
#### Other GST returns
With effect from 1 October 2018, the government has made tax deducted at source/tax collected at source provisions stipulated under GST laws effective.
Tax deducted at source provisions are applicable on cases specified under section 52 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. The notified taxpayers, like the government, Public Sector Undertakings, etc., are required to deduct 2% tax (1% CGST, 1% SGST, or 2% IGST) on payments made for goods/services to suppliers where payment exceeds INR 0.25 million. The tax so collected would be available as credit to the supplier in its electronic cash register, which can be used for set-off against future tax liabilities.
Tax collected at source provisions are applicable for e-commerce operators. Every e-commerce operator is required to deduct 1% tax (0.5% CGST, 0.5% SGST, or 1% IGST) on net value of supplies provided by suppliers through the e-commerce operator's portal. As per the Notification, for the supplies made through the platform of an e-commerce operator, tax is to be paid by the said e-commerce operator. Further, such transactions are to be reported by the e-commerce operator within their Form GSTR-3B.
The requirement of issuance of the tax deducted at source certificate under GST laws has been relaxed (post acceptance of tax deducted at source by deductee on GST portal, it shall be electronically available on GST portal).
The due date of filing the tax collected at source return (Form GSTR-8) is the 10th day of the next month.
### E-way bills
The e-way bill is an electronic bill that will be required for the movement of goods in case the value of the consignment is above INR 50,000. The movement of goods may be (i) in relation to supply, (ii) for reasons other than supply, or (iii) due to inward supply from unregistered persons.
The e-way bill can be generated from the GSTN portal, and every GST-registered taxpayer is required to comply with the requirement to issue an e-way bill.
With effect from 16 November 2018, new enhancements have been made in the e-way bill system, which involves checking of duplicate e-way bills, complete knock down/semi knock down movement of goods imported/exported, shipping address to be mentioned on e-way bill for goods exported outside India, etc.
A rule was inserted such that a person, including consignor, consignee, transporter, courier agency, or an e-commerce operator, who has not filed their GST returns for two consecutive tax periods will not be allowed to generate an e-way bill.
In cases where the principal supply is purely a supply of service and involving no movement of goods, the e-way bill is not required to be generated.
### Advance rulings for Customs and GST
To enable foreign investors to ascertain their indirect tax liabilities arising from proposed business ventures in India, the Central Government has constituted the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) as a high-level, quasi-judicial body. The functions of the AAR consist of giving advance rulings on a specific set of facts relating to specified matters under Customs and GST.
Advance rulings may be sought by any resident/non-resident investor entering into a joint venture in India in collaboration with another non-resident or resident of India, or by a resident setting up a joint venture in India in collaboration with a non-resident. This facility has also been made available to existing joint ventures in India. The Central Government is also empowered to include any other class or category of persons as eligible for the benefit of an advance ruling. Under the customs law, the Central Government has allowed a ‘resident public limited company’ to be eligible for an advance ruling. Under the erstwhile excise and service tax regime, advance rulings could be given only on a proposed transaction, whereas under GST, advance rulings can be obtained on a proposed transaction as well as a transaction being undertaken by the appellant.
In terms of GST provisions, the following matters/questions specified can be sought before the AAR:
The comprehensive provision for advance rulings is provided under GST to ensure that disputes are minimal. Timelines are also given within which the ruling is to be given by the concerned authority. The aim is to provide certainty to the taxpayer with respect to one's obligations under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and an expeditious ruling, so that the relationship between the taxpayer and administration is smooth and transparent and avoids unnecessary litigation.
### Amnesty scheme under indirect tax
Various states (*viz*. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, etc.) have introduced amnesty schemes for settlement of past VAT dues with waiver (certain percentage) of tax dues, interest, and penalty dues, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions.
Late fees for composition dealers have been reduced to INR 500 through Notification No. 2/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, in case of delayed filing of GSTR-4 from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2022, provided that the taxpayer’s file it on or before 30 June 2023. Further, if the tax payable is nil, then no late fees is required to be paid.
As per Notification No. 2/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, the taxable person whose registration got cancelled on account of non-filing of returns and who had failed to file revocation within the time limit (i.e. 30 days) can now apply for revocation of cancellation up to 30 June 2023 only after furnishing the returns due till effective date of cancellation along with due tax, interest, penalty, and late fee.
Best judgement assessment order shall be deemed to be withdrawn, provided returns along with interest and late fees have been filed up to 30 June 2023.
The late fees for delayed furnishing of the annual return for FY 2017/18 to FY 2021/22 has been reduced through Notification No. 7/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, to INR 20,000 (CGST 10,000 + SGST 10,000), provided such return has been furnished up to 30 June 2023.
The time limit for passing order under section 73(10) (i.e. non-fraud cases) has been extended by further three months in each of the FYs 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20, as follows:
The CBIC extended the time limit for availing the benefit of amnesty schemes as stated above, which were notified dated 31 March 2023, till 31 August 2023.
The time limit for filing appeal against demand orders under sections 73 and 74 issued till 31 March 2023 has been extended to 31 January 2024. The extension is subject to making a pre-deposit of 12.5% (as against 10%) of the tax under dispute (with at least an incremental 2.5% to be discharged from the electronic cash ledger).
The government has recently introduced an amnesty scheme through the CGST Act for matters pending under litigation other than fraud, misrepresentation, etc. under section 74 of the CGST Act. Through such amnesty, taxpayers can avail the benefit of resolution of such ongoing or pending matters through making payment of tax liability and availing the benefit of waiver of interest and penalty for the periods of FYs 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20.
## Customs duty
All goods imported into India are subject to customs entry requirements and are subject to customs duty generally on an *ad valorem* basis, except for few items (e.g. edible oils, gold, silver) that are subject to specific tariff rate as notified from time to time.
The customs duty is levied based on the classification as laid down in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which follows the Harmonized System of Nomenclature of the World Customs Organisation (WCO), with certain localisation. The customs duty on entry of goods is levied on transaction value (i.e. price paid or payable in additions as provided under Customs Valuation Rules, which are based on GATT Valuation Code). The value basis for assessment is CIF apart from other additions that may be required as directed by Customs in terms of Customs Valuation Rules. However, related-party transactions are scrutinised closely by Indian Customs for arm’s-length nature of transaction and complete disclosure of value for the purpose of assessment of customs duty.
The customs duty comprises basic customs duty (generally levied at 7.5% or 10%) apart from other duties comprising of:
In addition to these duties, which are dependent on classification, certain goods are subject to anti-dumping, countervailing, and safeguard duty as well. Also, depending upon the economic and trade requirement, the government can change the rate of duties on specified goods/sectors.
Exemption from these duties is extended on certain classifications and/or end use/sectoral promotion, including bilateral/multilateral trade agreements. Some of these exemptions can be conditional and require additional compliances as well. Moreover, exemptions now have a validity of two years from the date of notification.
Exemption from customs duties is also extended to promote exports, including businesses located in Free Trade Zones. However, these are linked to export commitments and other conditions/requirements.
Apart from customs duty, imports into India are subject to compliance with trade policy requirements as notified under Foreign Trade Policy. Largely, goods are freely importable; however, some goods may require pre-approval/licences and compliance with domestic regulations in terms of certifications, approvals, etc.
On the export side, while largely no customs duty is levied except on a few specified items, India, being part of the export control regime, monitors export of potential dual use goods and technology.
The cross-border transaction is done through the online portal of Indian Customs, which also has single window facilitation for other approvals. The customs duty needs to be paid electronically within 24 hours of importation and filing of import entry; otherwise, interest and penalty is payable as well. However, specific Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status holders are eligible for duty deferment benefit, subject to conditions. Apart from this benefit, the AEO status holders are extended certain additional benefits in terms of compliances and procedural relaxations.
Moreover, while the clearances are handled by the Customs Broker, the consequences of any error or mis-declaration lie with the importer. Hence, the Customs Broker arrangement needs to be examined and reviewed periodically *vis-à-vis* compliance status.
While Indian Customs now follows a self-declaration regime with faceless customs assessment system in operation, trade needs to ensure that declarations made at the time of import/export entry are correct and compliant with the applicable laws. Indian Customs has adopted post clearance audits where the trade is audited on these compliances as per internal guidelines or periodic checks.
As a trade facilitation measure, an Advance Ruling mechanism is available under Indian Customs for the trade to seek ruling on specific aspects prior to import, like classification, exemption/duty rates, valuation methodology, and origin compliance.
Non-compliance or evasion of duty through suppression of facts or mis-declaration can trigger investigation by the investigative arm of Indian Customs, which, depending upon the facts, can cover a five-year period and may result in notices for demand and penalties, including personal penalties. Hence, having a robust compliance and record management system is a must, as well as being updated on relevant developments.
## Property taxes
Property tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The rate of tax levied varies from city to city in India and is generally related to the prevailing market prices for property in each locality.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duty is a government tax that is levied on all legal property transactions. Stamp duty is a tax that is paid as evidence for any purchase or sale of a property between two or more parties. Stamp papers, which are bought either in the name of the buyer or seller, are valid for six months, provided the stamp duty is paid without any delay. No document that has not been duly stamped can be introduced as evidence in any court proceedings. Stamp duty is charged at both central and state levels. State level stamp duties vary from state to state, and on the document type. Stamp duty should be paid in full without any delay, failing which, a penalty is levied. Stamp duty has to be paid prior to execution (signature by an individual’s party) of a given document, the next day, or on the day of document execution. Stamp duty is paid by a buyer in most cases. However, both the seller and the buyer have to bear the burden of stamp duty for property exchange cases. Stamp duty rates differ in various states across the country, as stamp duty in India is a state subject. However, the Central Government fixes the stamp duty rates of specific instruments.
## Virtual digital assets (VDAs): Crypto taxation
Finance Act, 2022 has introduced provisions to bring VDAs (including crypto currencies, NFTs, etc) into tax ambit. The gains arising on transfer of VDAs would be taxable at 30% without providing any deduction of expenses other than cost of acquisition. Further, any loss arising on transfer of VDAs is not permitted to be set-off against any other income in the current year or subsequent years.
Tax is to be deducted at 1% payment to a resident on transfer of VDAs with effect from 1 July 2022.
## Buyback of shares
An additional tax is payable on transactions involving buyback of shares by Indian companies from its shareholders. A tax at 20% (plus surcharge at 12% and health and education cess at 4%) is payable by the company on the difference of consideration paid on buyback and the issue price of shares. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has prescribed the methodology for determination of amount received for issue of shares under 12 different situations, being a subject matter of tax on buyback. The buyback consideration received will be tax exempt in the hands of the receiver. No tax credit will be allowed in case of such taxes paid either to the company or to the shareholder.
Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions related to taxability of buyback of shares. As per the amended provisions, the buyback proceeds shall be considered as deemed dividend in the hands of shareholders. The cost of acquisition shall be considered as capital loss in the hands of shareholders, which can be adjusted against the capital gains, if any. The amended provisions shall be applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.
## Securities transaction tax (STT)
STT is applicable to transactions involving the purchase/sale of equity shares, derivatives, units of equity-oriented funds through a recognised stock exchange, or the purchase/sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to any mutual fund. The STT leviable in respect of such transactions varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based. Rate of STT varies from 0.001% to 0.125%, depending upon the nature of securities. However, securities transacted by any person on a recognised stock exchange located in an International Financial Services Centre where the consideration for such transaction is paid or payable in foreign currency are not subject to STT.
## Taxability of Partnership/ LLP
A partnership firm and an LLP are taxed as separate legal entities. The share of income of partners from a partnership firm or an LLP is exempt from tax. Partnerships and LLPs are taxed at 31.2% (inclusive of surcharge and health and education cess) if the income is less than INR 10 million and 34.944% (inclusive of surcharge and health and education cess) if the income exceeds INR 10 million. Alternate minimum tax at the rate of 18.5% applies to a partnership/LLP.
The interest payment to partners on capital or current account is allowed as tax-deductible expenditure. However, the maximum interest rate allowable for tax purposes is 12% *per annum*. A working partner can be paid salary, bonus, commission, or remuneration. The maximum permissible deduction in respect of remuneration payable collectively to all working partners is based on the book profit of the firm, at slab rates for different levels of book profit.
Finance Act, 2024 has introduced WHT provisions whereby if a partnership firm is making a payment (salary, remuneration, commission, bonus, or interest) to its partner over and above the prescribed threshold, that partnership firm is required to withhold taxes at the rate of 10%.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Income computation and disclosure standards (ICDS)
The CBDT has notified ten ICDS to be followed by all taxpayers that follow the mercantile system of accounting for the purpose of computation of income chargeable to income tax under the head ‘profits and gains of business or profession’ or ‘income from other sources’ and not for the purpose of maintenance of books of accounts. In case of conflict between the provisions of the Income-tax Act and the ICDS, the provisions of the Income-tax Act will prevail to that extent. These standards have been in effect since tax year 2016/17.
The list of certain important points on implementation of ICDS is given below:
## Capital gains
Capital gains refer to the gains made on the transfer of a capital asset. Transfer includes sale, exchange, relinquishment, or extinguishment of rights in an asset. Capital assets are either short-term capital assets or long-term capital assets. Long-term capital gains are eligible for a concessional rate of tax and indexation of cost of purchase and cost of improvement (*discussed below*).
Short-term capital assets are capital assets held for a period of not more than 36 months. In case of listed shares, listed securities, or units of specified mutual funds or zero-coupon bonds, the short-term holding period is not more than 12 months, and in case of unlisted shares is not more than 24 months. Capital assets that do not qualify as short-term capital assets are considered as long-term capital assets.
Normally, long-term capital gains are determined after increasing the cost by a prescribed multiplier that varies with the period of holding, to adjust for inflation. In case of non-residents, capital gains on transfer of shares or debentures in Indian companies are computed in the foreign currency in which the shares or debentures were acquired, and the capital gains are then reconverted into Indian currency to compute the tax liability thereon.
Capital gains are taxed as follows:
Finance Act, 2024 has rationalised the capital gains tax regime. These amended provisions are applicable for transfer made on or after 23 July 2024. The provisions amended by Finance Act, 2024 have been provided as follows:
Finance Act, 2024 also provides that for resident individuals and HUFs, if a land or building was acquired before 23 July 2024 and such land/building is transferred on or after 23 July 2024, the tax on long-term capital gains is required to be computed in accordance with the amended provisions, and in case tax computed in accordance with the amended provisions exceeds the tax computed as per the capital gains tax regime applicable prior to Finance Act, 2024, such excess capital gain tax shall be ignored and shall not be required to be paid.
## Taxability of transfer of property for nil or inadequate consideration
Where a person is in receipt of the following property for nil consideration or for an inadequate consideration, then the difference between the fair value of the property and the consideration paid will be considered as deemed income in the hands of recipient of the property:
In a case where the difference between the fair value of property and consideration paid does not exceed INR 50,000, the same will be ignored from this taxation. However, the limit of INR 50,000 was libralised in case of immovable property. It is now provided that no adjustments will be made in a case where the variation between stamp duty value and the sale consideration is not more than 10% of the sale consideration.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received by a domestic company with effect from 1 April 2020 will be taxable in hands of resident shareholders at the rates applicable to them.
A provision in the Income-tax Act has been introduced to provide for WHT at 10% on dividends in respect of units of mutual funds (in excess of INR 5,000) on dividend payments to resident shareholders.
Finance Act, 2022 has also withdrawn the concessional rate of 15% on dividend income received by Indian companies from specified foreign companies (shareholding of 26% or more) with effect from FY 2023/24.
In case of non-resident shareholders, dividends received post 1 April 2020 may be taxed at the rate of 20% under the Income-tax Act or tax treaty rate, whichever is beneficial.
WHT obligations will arise in the hands of a company distributing dividends to non-resident shareholders in such case. A corresponding deduction on account of interest would be allowed to the extent of 20% of such dividend income. This change is brought considering that the dividend distribution tax (DDT) has been abolished with effect from 1 April 2020.
Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions related to taxability of buyback of shares. As per the amended provisions, the buyback proceeds shall be considered as deemed dividend in the hands of shareholders. The amended provisions shall be applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.
## Interest income
Interest income received by an Indian company is taxable at normal CIT rates. Interest income received by a foreign company is taxed at a concessional rate of withholding at 5%/20%, subject to conditions. For companies engaged in manufacturing business and opting to pay corporate tax at the lower rate, interest income shall be taxable at 25.17% (including applicable surcharge and education cess).
## Foreign income
An Indian company is taxed on its worldwide income. A foreign company is taxed only on income that is received in India, or that accrues or arises, or is deemed to accrue or arise, in India. This income is subject to any favourable tax treaty provisions. According to the current tax law, payments for allowing/transferring the right to use software, customised data, or transmission of any signal by satellite, cable, optic fibre, or similar technology are taxable as royalty income deemed to accrue or arise in India, whether or not the location of such right or property is in India. The Indian Revenue Department notified the rules to grant foreign tax credit to resident taxpayers in respect of taxes paid in overseas countries. The rules lay down broad principles and conditions for computation and claim of foreign tax credit, respectively. In cases where the taxpayer has not been given credit of certain taxes paid outside India since the tax was under dispute, the taxpayer can approach the tax officer within six months from the end of the month in which the dispute was settled with prescribed documents. The tax officer has been empowered to pass an order granting consequential relief. This has been made effective from FY 2018/19 onwards.
Double taxation of foreign income for residents is avoided through tax treaties that generally provide for the deduction of the lower of foreign tax or Indian tax on the doubly taxed income from tax payable in India. Similar relief is allowed unilaterally where no tax treaty exists, in which case a resident would be taxed under the Income-tax Act but would be allowed a deduction from the Indian income tax payable of a sum being the lower of the Indian tax rate on the doubly taxed income or the rate of tax prevailing in the other country in which income is already taxed.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
There is an obligation on the payer (either resident or non-resident) of income to withhold tax when certain specified payments are credited and/or paid. Some of the expenses that require WHT are as follows.
## Payments to resident companies
| Nature of payment | Payment threshold for WHT (INR) (1) | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Rent of land, building, or furniture | 240,000 | 10 |
| Contractual payment (except for individual/HUF) | 30,000 (single payment); 100,000 (aggregate payment) | 2 |
| Contractual payment to individual/HUF | 30,000 (single payment); 100,000 (aggregate payment) | 1 |
| Payments by individual/HUF not covered under payments to contractors/commission or brokerage/fees of professional or technical services | 5 million | 5 |
| Dividend income on shares | 5,000 | 10 |
| Dividends for units of mutual fund | 5,000 | 10 |
| Purchase of immovable property | 5 million | 1 |
| Cash withdrawal from bank or banking company (3) | 10 million | 2 |
| Payments to an e-commerce participant, in relation to sale of goods or services facilitated by e-commerce operator through digital platform | - | 0.1 (7) |
| Winning from online gaming | - | 30 |
Notes
1. Payments have different threshold limits. The payer is only required to withhold tax if the total payment within a tax year to a single person (except where specified otherwise) is above the limits specified above.
2. The threshold limit for WHT for non-specified type of interest is INR 5,000, except in the case of interest received from a bank or deposit with post office, for which it is INR 10,000. This threshold limit is increased to INR 50,000 in case of interest provided by a co-operative society, and INR 40,000 if recipient of interest is a senior citizen (i.e. age of more than 60 years).
3. Where the cash has been withdrawn by any person who has not filed return of income for three immediately preceding financial years, the threshold of INR 10 million will be read as INR 2 million and tax will be deducted at 2% on amount exceeding INR 2 million but not exceeding INR 10 million and 5% on amount above INR 10 million.
4. The definition of ‘royalty’ also includes consideration for use of, or right to use, computer software. Transfer of all or any rights in respect of any right, property, or information includes transfer of all or any right to use computer software (including granting of a licence), irrespective of the medium through which such a right is transferred and irrespective of whether any right or property is located in India.
5. Tax at 2% is to be withheld in case the company is engaged in business of operation of call centres.
6. Finance Act, 2024 has amended the rate to 2% with effect from 1 October 2024.
7. Finance Act, 2024 has amended the rate to 0.1% with effect from 1 October 2024.
Important point for consideration:
Finance Act, 2021 has prescribed a levy of higher tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS) on non-filers of income tax returns. Accordingly, higher TDS will be applicable to those having interest income, dividend income, annuity pensions, and income from capital gains. However, this higher TDS will only apply to a specified category of non-filers of returns. Further, this new section shall not apply where the tax is required to be deducted in case of salaries, provident fund, winning from lottery, winning from horse rates, income received from a securitisation trust, or cash withdrawal exceeding INR 2 million. As per the provisions under the Indian Income-tax Act, the higher TDS rate applied will be the higher of:
### Application for permanent account number (PAN)
Every person (not being an individual) who enters into a financial transaction of an amount aggregating to INR 250,000 or more will be required to apply to a tax officer for a PAN.
If the PAN of the deductee is not quoted, the rate of WHT will be the rate specified in relevant provisions of the Income-tax Act, the rates in force, or the rate of 20%, whichever is higher.
## Payments to non-resident companies
| Nature of payment | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Interest on foreign currency (subject to conditions) | 5 |
| Interest on money borrowed in foreign currency under a loan agreement or by way of long-term infrastructure bonds (or rupee denominated bonds) | 5 |
| Interest on investment in long-term infrastructure bonds issued by Indian company (rupee denominated bonds or government security) | 5 |
| Interest payable on long-term bonds listed on IFSC | 4 |
| Non-specified type of interest where money is borrowed in foreign currency | 20 |
| Royalty and FTS | 20 |
| Dividend income | 20 |
| Long-term capital gains other than equity shares of a company or units of equity-oriented fund/business trust on which STT is paid | 20 |
| Long-term capital gains on equity shares of a company or units of equity-oriented fund/business trust on which STT is paid | 10 |
| Income by way of winning from horse races | 30 |
| Winning from online gaming | 30 |
| Other income | 35 |
Notes
## Tax deducted at source (TDS) on purchase of goods
The Finance Act, 2021 has introduced the provisions related to TDS on purchase of goods, which is applicable from 1 July 2021. The salient features are the following:
Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions to include the scope of nil or lower WHT certificate for TDS on purchase of goods.
## Tax collected at source (TCS) on sale of goods
The Finance Act, 2020 has introduced provisions for TCS on sale of goods at the rate of 0.1% on transactions for sale of goods exceeding INR 5 million effective from 1 October 2020. These provisions are applicable only if the turnover/gross receipts of the seller in the immediately preceding year do not exceed INR 100 million. Further, where PAN/Aadhar is not provided by buyer, tax will be collected at the rate of 1%. This provision will not apply where the seller exports goods out of India or the buyer is importing goods into India or the said transaction is already covered under any other provision of tax laws.
## TCS on Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) and on purchase of overseas tour program package
The Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions whereby the rate at which tax is required to be collected on the following was reduced from 20% to 5%:
In any other situation covered under the provision, the TCS rate continues to be 20%, subject to certain exceptions.

Notes
1. The treaty tax rates on dividends are not relevant for dividends received up to 31 March 2020 since, under the earlier Indian tax legislation, most dividend income from Indian companies that is subject to DDT is exempt from income tax in the hands of the recipient. However, this scenario has changed since the DDT is abolished and tax is now levied in the hands of the recipient of dividend income with effect from 1 April 2020.
2. 10% for the use of or right to use any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment; and in other cases:
1. During the first five years of the agreement:
2. Subsequent years: 15% in all cases.
3. If at least 10% of capital is owned by the beneficial owner (company) of the company paying the dividend or interest.
4. In absence of specific provision, it may be treated as business profits or independent personal services under respective tax treaties, whichever is applicable.
5. The Ministry of Finance has issued a notification on 19 March 2024 permitting the benefit of MFN clause under the India-Spain tax treaty. The Indian government amended the India-Spain tax treaty by importing a lower tax rate of 10% for royalty and FTS from the India-Germany tax treaty. The lower tax rate shall be applicable from financial year 2023/24 corresponding to tax year 2024/25.
6. If royalty relates to copyrights of literary, artistic, or scientific work.
7. If at least 25% of capital is owned by the beneficial owner (company) of the company paying the dividend.
8. If at least 25% of capital is owned by the company during at least six months before date of payment.
9. If paid on a loan granted by a bank/financial institution.
10. The tax rate for royalties and FTS, under the domestic tax laws, is 20%. This rate is to be increased by a surcharge at 2%/5% on the income tax (based on taxable income) and health and education cess of 4% on the income tax including surcharge. Consequently, the effective tax rate is 20.8%/21.84%. This rate applies for payments made under an agreement entered into on or after 1 June 2005. Accordingly, a tax resident can either use the tax treaty rate or domestic tax rate, whichever is more beneficial.
11. If interest is received by a financial institution.
12. Taxable in the country of source as per domestic tax rates.
13. If royalty payments arise from the use or right to use trademarks.
14. Tax treaties of certain countries do not have a separate clause specifying the WHT rate for fees for technical services and fees for included services.
15. 5% if the beneficial owner is a company holding at least 10% of the share capital; 15% in other cases.
16. 15% of gross amount of dividend in case such dividend is paid out of income derived from immovable property and such income is exempt from tax. 10% in all other cases.
17. 10% if such interest is paid on a loan granted by a bank carrying on a *bona fide* banking business or by a similar financial institution (including an insurance company).
18. 10% if payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment and fee for included services that are ancillary and subsidiary to the enjoyment of the property for which payment is received.
19. Dividend/interest earned by the government and certain institutions, like the Reserve Bank of India, is exempt from taxation in the country of source.
20. If it is payable in pursuance of any collaboration agreement approved by the government of India.
## India tax position on the Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
India signed the MLI in June 2017. The Indian Government approved the ratification of the MLI on 13 June 2019, and India deposited the ratification instrument along with its final MLI position on 25 June 2019. The date of entry into force for India is 1 October 2019, and the date of entry into effect for India is 1 April 2020. The following tax treaties have been amended to date pursuant to the effect of the MLI.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Social security contributions
Indian social security is broadly governed by the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (PF Act) and schemes made thereunder, namely the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme (EPF) and the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS). The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), a statutory body established by the government of India, administers social security regulations in India.
Currently, Indian social security regulations apply mandatorily to an establishment in India employing 20 or more persons or where an establishment voluntarily seeks registration with the authorities. Employees (including foreign nationals) working with an establishment in India to which the PF Act applies are liable to contribute towards the provident fund at the fixed rate of 12% of salary. The employer is required to make the matching contribution and deposit both the employer’s and employee’s contributions (i.e. 24%) to the provident fund of the employee by the 15th day of the following month.
Out of the employer’s contribution of 12%, an amount equal to 8.33% of salary (salary capped at INR 15,000 per month in respect of Indian employees) is allocated to the pension fund of the employee.
### International worker
The government of India made the social security scheme mandatory for cross-border workers. A foreign national qualifies as an ‘international worker’ if he/she is coming to work for an establishment in India to which the PF Act applies.
Similarly, an Indian national qualifies as an ‘international worker’ if he/she has worked or is going to work in a country with which India has entered into a social security agreement (SSA) and is eligible to avail benefits under the social security program of the host country, according to the terms of the relevant SSA. However, it has been clarified that Indian employees holding a certificate of coverage (COC)/detachment certificate, obtained from Indian social security authorities and contributing to the Indian social security schemes, will not become international workers and will continue to be treated like any other domestic Indian employees. Also, Indian employees qualifying as international workers on account of working/having worked in a country with which India has an SSA will re-acquire the status of Indian employees upon repatriation to India after completion of overseas assignment. Accordingly, such employees will not be subject to the special provisions applicable to international workers after repatriating to India.
### Exemption
An international worker from a country with which India has an SSA in force is exempted from Indian social security where he or she:
Similarly, an international worker from a country with which India has entered into a bilateral comprehensive economic agreement prior to 1 October 2008 is exempted from Indian social security where:
To amend and consolidate a majority of Indian labour laws, the following four labour codes have been passed by the Parliament of India, which subsumes and amalgamates 29 different central labour laws legislations:
There are several changes, ranging from reclassification of workforce to changes in the definition of salary for employees’ benefit and other matters.
The Ministry of Labour and Employment of India has deferred the implementation of the above four codes.
### Other issues
## Goods and services tax (GST)
## Wealth taxes
There are no wealth taxes in India.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no inheritance tax in India.
There is no gift tax liability on the donor. However, any sum of money aggregating to INR 50,000 or more received during the relevant tax year without consideration or for an inadequate consideration by an individual from any person not being a relative (see below for details) is subject to income tax in the hands of the recipient.
Similarly, the following receipts are also subject to tax:
Further, the same are not considered as taxable if received at the time of marriage, under a will/inheritance, in contemplation of death of the payer, or through any other criteria specified in the law.
## Property taxes
Property tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The rate of tax levied varies from city to city in India and is generally related to the prevailing market prices for property in each locality.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains from the disposal of capital assets are liable to tax in the tax year in which such assets are sold or transferred. Capital assets include all forms of property, stocks and shares, land and buildings, goodwill, etc. (but exclude personal effects except stock-in-trade, stores, and raw materials held for business purposes). Jewellery also forms part of capital assets.
### Categorising capital gains
Earlier capital assets held for more than 36 months (12 months in the case of securities [other than units] listed on a recognised stock exchange in India, units of the Unit Trust of India, units of equity-oriented mutual funds, and zero-coupon bonds; 24 months for immovable property or unlisted shares) are termed as ‘long-term capital assets’, and the assets not so held are called ‘short-term capital assets’. However, from 23 July 2024, capital assets held for more than 24 months immediately preceding the date of its transfer (12 months in the case of securities (including units) listed on a recognised stock exchange in India, units of the Unit Trust of India, units of equity-oriented mutual funds, and zero-coupon bonds) will be termed as ‘long-term capital assets’.
Capital gains arising from the transfer/disposal of long-term capital assets are called 'long-term capital gains'. Gains arising from the disposal of short-term capital assets are called 'short-term capital gains'. This distinction is important as long-term capital gains are taxed or treated beneficially and there are also planning opportunities to save taxes provided the consideration or gain is re-invested, subject to fulfilment of certain other conditions.
Long-term capital gains are subject to tax at prescribed beneficial rates (plus applicable surcharge and health and education cess). Short-term capital gains are added to the taxable income of the individual and subject to tax at normal slab rates.
### Computation of long-term capital gains
Except in case of debentures and bonds (other than capital indexed bonds issued by Government/Sovereign Gold Bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India), the cost of acquisition of long-term capital assets is determined after indexing costs by a prescribed inflation factor (known as ‘indexed cost of acquisition’). The base year for computation of indexed cost of acquisition is 2001. Assets acquired before 1 April 2001 can be taken at actual cost or FMV as on 1 April 2001 at the option of the taxpayer. However, effective 1 April 2020, in case of capital asset being land or building or both, the FMV of such asset on 1 April 2001 will not exceed the stamp duty value, wherever applicable, of such asset as on 1 April 2001.
In case of an NR where shares or debentures of an Indian company are purchased by utilising foreign currency, the subsequent capital gains are determined by computing the gains in the same foreign currency in which it was purchased and reconverting the gains into Indian rupees to calculate the tax payable on the same.
However, there are a few exceptions for indexation and rate of tax on long-term capital gains/short-term capital gains:
For transfer/disposal of capital assets on or after 23 July 2024, the rate of tax has been increased to 12.5% and the non-taxable amount has been increased to INR 125,000.
For transaction of sale effective 1 April 2018 in respect of above-mentioned capital assets already held from a date prior to 31 January 2018, the cost of acquisition would be determined as the higher of the following:
- FMV as of 31 January 2018.
- The full value of consideration arising on transfer.
The surcharge rate of 25%/37% will not apply to capital gains arising on sale of equity share of a listed company or a unit of an equity oriented mutual fund or unit of business trust. The enhanced surcharge rates of 25%/37% will also not apply to the income of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) arising from securities prescribed under the Income-tax Act.
Moreover, on income arising on account of long-term capital gains on all the capital assets, the rate of surcharge will be 15%.
For NRs, the basic exemption limit of INR 250,000 does not apply against the gains earned on sale of such shares/units.
Tax liability on long-term capital gains can be reduced by taking benefit of exemptions provided in the Income-tax Act when gains/sale proceeds from the sale of the capital assets are reinvested into house property and/or prescribed investments. Effective 1 April 2023, benefit claimed on long-term capital gains arising from transfer of capital asset where gains are re-invested in a residential house has been restricted to INR 100 million.
Short-term capital losses can be offset against any capital gains (long-term or short-term). Long-term capital loss can only be offset against long-term capital gains. Unabsorbed capital losses (short-term or long-term) can be carried forward for a maximum of eight years to be offset only against future capital gains as mentioned above.
To raise funds for the Start-up Action Plan, the government has provided an exemption from long-term capital gains on the sale of any long-term capital asset if the sale consideration is invested in units of a specified fund. The specified fund will be notified by the Central Government in due course, and the maximum deduction available will be INR 5 million. The investments should be held for a minimum period of three years to avail the exemption.
Effective 1 April 2019, a once in a lifetime option has been given to an individual/HUF wherein long-term capital gains (up to INR 20 million) arising from transfer of a residential property can now be reinvested in two house properties in India. Further, an individual/HUF selling a residential property also has the option to reinvest the long-term capital gains by subscribing to shares of a company that qualifies as a small or medium enterprise and in shares of eligible start-ups with no cap on reinvestment of the capital gain. Investments under this provision can be made up to 31 March 2022. In case the eligible start-up is a technology driven start-up, it will be entitled to utilise the proceeds of such equity shares in computers or computer software.
On account of transaction in immovable property, any income earned is either taxed under income from capital gains or income from other sources. The income is taxed on the basis of the sale consideration or stamp duty value, whichever is higher. In case the sale consideration is less than the stamp duty value, the differential is taxed as income from other sources. However, effective 1 April 2020, in case of sale, no such adjustments will be made in cases where the difference between stamp duty value and sale consideration is not more than 10% of such sale consideration. In case of purchase, if the variation between stamp duty value and sale consideration does not exceed INR 50,000 or 10% of sale consideration, no addition is to be made to total income.
The above limit has been enhanced from 10% to 20% in relation to immovable property acquired during the period 12 November 2020 to 30 June 2021 by way of first-time allotment from a real estate developer for a consideration up to INR 20 million.
## Securities transaction tax (STT)
STT is applicable to transactions involving purchase/sale of equity shares, derivatives, units of equity-oriented funds through a recognised stock exchange, or purchase/sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to any mutual fund. The STT leviable for such transactions varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based.
## Buyback of shares
An additional tax is payable on transactions involving buyback of shares by Indian companies from its shareholders. A tax at 20% (plus surcharge at 12% and health and education cess at 4%) is payable by the company on the difference of consideration paid on buyback and the issue price of shares. The Revenue Department has prescribed the methodology for determination of amount received for issue of shares under different situations, being a subject matter of tax on buyback. The buyback consideration received will be tax exempt in the hands of the receiver. No tax credit will be allowed in case of such taxes paid either to the company or to the shareholder.
With effect from 1 October 2024, consideration received under buyback is proposed to be taxed as deemed dividend in the hands of the shareholders. Moreover, no deduction for expenses shall be available to the shareholder against such deemed dividend. Additionally, the amount originally invested in the shares being bought back would be available as a capital loss and shall be available for set-off against the future capital gain from sale of shares or otherwise.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Corporate income tax (CIT) rate for foreign companies reduced to 35%
The CIT rate applicable for foreign companies (for incomes other than identified streams of income, such as royalty or fee for technical service [FTS]) was 40% (plus applicable surcharge and cess). Finance Act, 2024 has amended the domestic tax law provisions to reduce the applicable CIT rate on foreign companies to 35% (plus applicable surcharge and cess).
## Abolishment of angel tax
The angel tax provisions were introduced by the Finance Act, 2012 to tax a company on the issue of shares for a consideration higher than the fair market value (FMV), as prescribed under the income tax rules. This was extended to include investments from non-resident investors in 2023.
Finance Act, 2024 has abolished the angel tax for all categories of investors with effect from 1 April 2024.
## Taxation of buyback of shares brought on equal footing with dividend
In 2013, the Indian government introduced special provisions relating to tax on distributed income of a domestic company from the buyback of shares. Therefore, an Indian company was subject to tax at the rate of 20% on the distributed income on the buyback of shares. This scheme of taxation was in line with the then dividend distribution tax (DDT), under which any dividend distribution was taxed in the hands of the distributing Indian company. In 2020, DDT was removed, and the dividend was made taxable in the hands of shareholders.
A sunset clause has been inserted in the extant provision under which the aforesaid tax was levied making it inapplicable from 1 October 2024. Therefore, the aforesaid 20% tax shall not be applicable to any buyback that takes place after 30 September 2024.
Further, as per the Finance Act 2024, the proceeds from buyback have now been treated as deemed dividend, on a gross basis. The cost of acquisition of shares bought back is to be treated as capital loss in the hands of the shareholder and allowed to be set off against any capital gains. The withholding tax (WHT) provisions applicable on dividend income have also been amended to provide that taxes shall also be required to be withheld at the rate of 10% for such deemed dividend. The amended provisions are applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.
## Rationalisation of capital gains tax provisions
Finance Act, 2024 has rationalised the capital gains tax regime. These amended provisions are applicable for transfers made on or after 23 July 2024. The provisions amended by Finance Act, 2024 have been provided as follows:
The indexation benefit, which allows shareholders to adjust their purchase price for inflation, has been removed for all taxpayers except individuals and Hindu undivided families (HUFs).
The aforementioned amended provisions are applicable for transfers made on or after 23 July 2024.
## Reduced period of limitation for re-assessment proceedings under income tax
The provisions related to re-assessment proceedings under domestic tax laws were substantially revamped in 2021. Besides the procedure, the general limitation period for initiating the re-assessment proceedings was significantly reduced to three years.
However, in certain cases, this timeline could be extended to ten years if the tax authorities possess documentary evidence that there is an escapement of income. To further rationalise these provisions, *vide* Finance Act 2024, the time period for initiating the re-assessment proceedings in the above-mentioned specified cases is reduced to five years from ten years.
## Indian government notifies lower royalty and FTS tax-rate in India-Spain Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)
The Ministry of Finance has issued a notification on 19 March 2024 permitting the benefit of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause under the India-Spain DTAA. The Indian government amended the India-Spain DTAA by importing a lower tax rate of 10% for royalty and FTS from the India-Germany DTAA. The lower tax rate shall be applicable from financial year 2023/24 corresponding to tax year 2024/25.
## Government notifies list of payments to International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) units on which no taxes are required to be withheld
The Indian government has notified the list of payments made by any payer to the IFSC units on which no taxes are required to be withheld by the payer. The list includes 14 different kinds of IFSC units where taxes are not required to be withheld by the payer on various payments, subject to fulfilment of conditions prescribed in the said notification. This notification is effective from 1 April 2024.
## Abolishment of equalisation levy applicable on non-resident e-commerce operators
Finance Act, 2020 had amended the provisions related to the equalisation levy to provide that non-resident e-commerce operators, providing e-commerce supply or services beyond a specified threshold, shall be required to pay equalisation levy at the rate of 2%.
Finance Act, 2024 has now abolished the equalisation levy on non-resident e-commerce operators with effect from 1 August 2024.
It may be noted that the equalisation levy at the rate of 6% continues to apply on specified services, i.e. on online advertisement, any provision for digital advertising space, or any other facility or service for the purpose of online advertisement, which includes any other service as may be notified by the Central Government in this regard.
## Relief to eligible start-ups
The domestic tax laws provide certain tax deductions to eligible start-ups, provided such eligible start-up is incorporated on or before 31 March 2023. The sunset clause of 31 March 2024 has now been extended to 31 March 2025.
Further, eligible start-ups can now carry forward and set off the losses for a period of ten years as compared to the earlier limit of seven years.
## Tax Amnesty Scheme, 2024
In order to settle the pending disputes, Finance Act, 2024 has introduced the Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, 2024 (Scheme). The disputed tax matters pending till a specified date can be settled under the Scheme by paying disputed taxes. The Scheme provides that no interest or penal implications shall arise in the hands of the taxpayer for the matters settled under the Scheme. The scheme is applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
A company is treated as a resident of India in any previous year if:
## Place of effective management (PoEM)
Presently, a foreign company is considered resident in India if the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in India.
To bring to tax those companies that are incorporated outside India but controlled from India, the condition of PoEM has been introduced. PoEM is an internationally recognised concept accepted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
A foreign company will be regarded as a resident in India if its PoEM is in India in that year. Since ‘residency’ is determined for each year, PoEM is also required to be determined on a year-to-year basis. The concept of PoEM is one of substance over form. The term PoEM has been explained to mean a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance, made. To provide clarity and address certain concerns for implementation of determination of residency of a foreign company on the basis of PoEM, the Indian Revenue Department has issued a circular laying down guidelines. The guidelines laid down the concept of determination of PoEM based on bifurcation of companies engaged in active business outside India and other companies. The circulars clarify that the PoEM provisions will not apply to a foreign company having turnover or gross receipts of INR 500 million or less in a tax year.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is defined in India as a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on or through an agent who habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts or regularly delivers goods or merchandise or habitually secures orders on behalf of a non-resident.
## Business connection
The scope of 'business connection' was amended under the Income-tax Act to align with the modified PE Rule as per the Multilateral Instrument (MLI).
'Business connection' includes business activities carried on by a non-resident through dependent agents. The scope of 'business connection' under the Income-tax Act is similar to the provisions relating to Dependent Agent Permanent Establishment (DAPE) in India’s tax treaties. The amendment provides that business connection shall also include any business activities carried through a person who, acting on behalf of the non-resident, habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principal role leading to conclusion of contracts by the non-resident. It further states that the contracts should be:
Further, as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 'significant economic presence' would also constitute a 'business connection' in India.
The term 'significant economic presence' has been modified, and the applicability of same has been deferred to FY 2021/22.
'Significant economic presence' means:
However, only so much of income as is attributable to such transactions or activities will be deemed to accrue or arise in India. It is also proposed that the transactions or activities will constitute significant economic presence in India, whether or not the non-resident has a residence or place of business in India or renders services in India.
The income tax return forms applicable to companies (including foreign companies) have been updated for FY 2021/22 explicitly including disclosure of significant economic presence status of a foreign company in India during FY 2021/22.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Expenses that are revenue in nature are, by and large, allowed as a deduction to businesses and professionals if they are:
## Depreciation
Depreciable assets are grouped in blocks, and each block is eligible for depreciation at a prescribed rate. The Indian Revenue Department clarified that with effect from 1 April 2017 the block of assets that are entitled to more than 40% depreciation will now be restricted to 40%. However, a higher depreciation rate of 45% is allowed for certain assets under the 'plant and machinery' block on satisfaction of certain conditions. Hence, the depreciation rate available in case of different blocks of assets ranges from 0% to 45%, depending upon the classification.
## Goodwill
The government of India, in the Finance Act, 2021, has excluded 'goodwill of a business or profession' from the definition of block of asset. By virtue of this amendment, goodwill of any nature shall not be considered as a depreciable asset for the purpose of tax amortisation under the India Income-tax Act.
## Expenses incurred before the commencement of business
Certain specified expenses are incurred by taxpayers either before the start-up of a business or after the commencement of a business, in connection with extension of the industrial undertaking, or in connection with setting-up a new unit. One-fifth of such expenditure is allowed as a deduction each year, over a period of five years.
## Interest expenses
Any interest paid by a taxpayer on capital borrowed for the purposes of the taxpayer’s business or profession is tax-deductible without any limit. However, if such interest is paid to certain related persons (non-resident associated enterprise), then, the interest expense will be restricted to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). Excess interest expenditure disallowed in that year can be carried forward for eight years and would be available for set-off. If the capital is borrowed for acquiring a capital asset, then interest liability pertaining to the period until the time the asset is used cannot be allowed as a tax-deductible expense and will have to be added to the cost of such asset.
There are some specific guidelines for interest deduction being prescribed in ICDS.
## Expenditure incurred on corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities
Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on CSR activities mandated under the Companies Act, 2013 is not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes under the Income-tax Act. However, if contributions are made to any prescribed charitable institutions, then deduction may be examined*.*
## Expenses allowable on actual payment basis
Certain expenses, such as, but not limited to, employees’ provident fund dues (i.e. retirement benefit funds), bonus to employees, interest payable to financial institutions and banks, and payments to be made to micro, small, and medium enterprises are allowed as tax-deductible expenses only on actual payment. Tax disallowances are attracted if certain payments are delayed beyond their due dates under the respective laws.
## Bribes, kickbacks, illegal payments
Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer that is illegal is deemed not to have been incurred for the purposes of the business or profession, and no deduction of such expenditure will be allowed. The Finance Act, 2022 has restricted the deductibility of the expenditure that is in relation to an offence or is prohibited by the law. It has been provided that the expenses incurred in connection with an offence or violation of any law (in India or outside India), including expenditure incurred for compounding of any offence, will not be allowed as a business expenditure. It is further provided that any benefit or perquisite paid to a person in violation of any laws, rules, and regulations governing such person’s conduct will not be allowed as business expenditure.
## Fines and penalties
The Income-tax Act provides for deductibility of fines, penalties, and interest as follows:
## Taxes
All taxes (tax, duty, cess, or fees by whatever name called) relating to business (other than income tax) incurred during the tax year are usually deductible only in the year of payment. The Finance Act, 2022 has clarified that the term ‘tax’ includes surcharge and education cess, with retrospective effect from 1 April 2005.
## Net operating losses
Losses can be carried forward and set-off against income from subsequent year(s) for periods set out in the following table:
| Types of losses | Time limit |
| --- | --- |
| Unabsorbed depreciation | Perpetually |
| Business losses (other than speculation business losses) | 8 years |
| Speculation business losses | 4 years |
| Capital losses | 8 years |
There are no provisions in India for carrying losses back to earlier years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Indian companies can claim deduction for payments on account of royalties, and for interest and fees for technical or management service provided by foreign affiliates, so long as they are not capital in nature. Such payments are deductible in the year the requisite WHT is paid into the government treasury.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Group taxation is not permitted under the Indian tax law.
## Transfer pricing
### Transfer pricing on international transactions
The Indian transfer pricing regulations (ITPR) stipulate that income arising from ‘international transactions’ between ‘associated enterprises’ should be computed having regard to the ‘arm’s-length price’. Furthermore, any allowance for expenses or interest arising from any international transaction is also to be determined having regard to the arm’s-length price. The expressions ‘international transactions’ and ‘associated enterprises’ have been defined in the ITPR.
The ITPR also contain the concept of ‘deemed international transaction’ whereby a transaction between an enterprise and a third party (whether based in India or overseas) would be subjected to transfer pricing regulations in case there exists a prior agreement in relation to such a transaction between the third party and the associated enterprise of the transacting enterprise or if the terms of such a transaction are determined in substance between the third party and the associated enterprise of the transacting enterprise.
The ITPR also define a certain class of transactions undertaken by a taxpayer with its domestic related parties and whose aggregate value exceeds INR 200 million as specified domestic transactions to which the transfer pricing provisions apply.
Initially, the ITPR prescribed five methods for computation of arm’s-length price. These are broadly in line with OECD Guidelines. A sixth method, termed as the ‘other method’, was notified in 2012. Taxpayers are required to adopt the most appropriate method for determining the arm’s-length price.
Taxpayers are also required to maintain a comprehensive set of prescribed information and documents relating to international transactions and specified domestic transactions that are undertaken between associated enterprises, on an annual basis, within the prescribed timelines. Taxpayers being a constituent entity of an international group shall also keep and maintain such information and documents (essentially master file and country-by-country [CbC] report) in respect of the international group. Further, taxpayers are required to obtain an Accountant’s Report (certificate) from an independent accountant certifying the nature and amount of international transactions. The certificate needs to be filed one month in advance of the income tax return. The burden of proving the arm’s-length character of the transaction is primarily on the taxpayer. On 1 October 2020 and on 5 March 2024, the CBDT notified certain changes in the form of the certificate, including expanding the coverage of specified domestic transactions in certain cases.
The taxpayer is required to comply with the above requirements on an annual basis.
The ITPR adopts an arithmetic mean of comparable prices as the arm's-length price, with a flexibility of deviation from the percentage that is notified by the Central Government as +/- 1% for wholesalers and +/- 3% for others. The CBDT has also prescribed rules for use of range for determining arm’s-length price, which is discussed subsequently. Where the transfer pricing officer is of the opinion that the arm’s-length price was not applied, the officer may re-compute the taxable income after giving the taxpayer an opportunity to be heard. Stringent penalties are prescribed in cases of failure to comply with the provisions of the ITPR.
### Notified Jurisdictional Area (NJA)
Any transaction between a taxpayer and a person located in an NJA or a transaction entered into by a taxpayer wherein one of the parties is located in an NJA will be covered under the ITPR. However, the benefit of the +/- 3% range and the option to be covered under the Safe Harbour Rules would not be available in this case.
### Safe Harbour Rules
Safe Harbour Rules were notified in 2013. These rules prescribe who the eligible taxpayers are, which are the eligible international transactions, the target operating margin, procedural aspects, timeline for audit, etc. Thereafter, these Safe Harbour Rules were also extended to certain domestic transactions. Safe Harbour Rules also cover attribution of profits to a PE.
The Safe Harbour Rules were initially applicable for a maximum of five tax years beginning with tax year 2013/14.
Thereafter, in June 2017, the CBDT made amendments to the Safe Harbour Rules reducing the target operating margins for most of the eligible international transactions. Further, the revised Safe Harbour Rules introduced receipt of low value-adding intra-group services to the list of eligible transactions subject to certain thresholds. Also, there were certain modifications made to the definitions of certain terms *vis-à-vis* in the original Safe Harbour Rules. The revised Safe Harbour Rules are applicable for a maximum of three tax years beginning with tax year 2017/18 with the taxpayers having an option to apply the original Safe Harbour Rules or the revised Safe Harbour Rules for the tax year 2017/18, whichever is more beneficial. Subsequently, the CBDT notified certain amendments to the Safe Harbour Rules in December 2023, including the expansion of the scope of intra-group loan transactions covered within the ambit of the Safe Harbour Rules and modifications to the definitions of certain terms.
Where a taxpayer has opted to be covered under the Safe Harbour Rules and the transfer price declared has been accepted by the tax authorities, then such a taxpayer cannot invoke proceedings under a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP).
In May 2020, the CBDT notified that the revised Safe Harbour Rules applicable for tax years 2017/18 to 2019/20 will continue to apply for tax year 2020/21. The CBDT, on 24 September 2021, notified to extend applicability of Safe Harbour Rules for tax year 2021/22 as well. On 17 June 2022, the CBDT further extended the applicability of Safe Harbour Rules to tax year 2022/23. Again, *vide* a notification dated 9 August 2023, the CBDT extended the applicability of the Safe Harbour Rules to tax year 2023/24.
It is pertinent to note that no Safe Harbour Rules have yet been notified for the subsequent tax year. We will have to wait for any further notification from the Indian Revenue Department in this regard.
### Advance pricing agreements (APAs)
An APA is an arrangement between the taxpayer and the tax authorities covering transactions, with a view to pre-empt potential transfer pricing disputes. The CBDT has notified detailed rules providing the procedures and necessary forms for application/administration of APAs.
The rules provide for constitution of an APA team, which shall consist of an income tax authority and experts from economics, statistics, law, and other necessary fields. APAs can be applied to existing, as well as proposed, transactions. Further, APAs entered into after 1 April 2020 can also cover attribution of profits to PEs.
The rules have provided for both unilateral and bilateral/multilateral APAs. In cases where a bilateral APA negotiated between competent authorities is not acceptable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer may, at its option, continue with the process of entering into a unilateral APA without benefit of an MAP.
The salient features of the procedure laid down for APAs are application for APA, withdrawal of APA, defective application, procedure, compliances post-APA, cancellations of APA, and revisions and renewal of APA.
The legislation has provisions of roll-back of APAs for four years prior to the first year covered under the APA.
### Rules prescribing the use of ‘range’ and multiple year data
The CBDT has notified the rules prescribing the scheme for the usage of the ‘range’ concept and multiple year financial data for determining the arm’s-length price. These rules are applicable to international transactions and specified domestic transactions.
The rules envisage the applicability of the ‘range’ concept only where the arm’s-length price determination is done using either the transactional net margin method, resale price method, cost plus method, or comparable uncontrolled price method. Furthermore, the rules in connection with the applicability of the ‘range’ concept, *inter alia*, prescribe the adequate number of external comparables and the methodology for computing the upper and lower percentile. In case the number of external comparables identified is not adequate, the ‘range’ concept will not apply and the concept of arithmetic mean will continue to apply.
The multiple year data can only be used if the most appropriate method selected for benchmarking purposes is either transactional net margin method, resale price method, or cost plus method. Further, multiple year data entails use of data for the year under consideration (current year) and data for up to two preceding financial years. Data for the current year is compulsorily to be considered. If the data for the current year is available and is not comparable on account of either qualitative or quantile reasons, the comparable cannot be considered.
### Master file and country-by-country (CbC) reporting documentation as per base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
The government has introduced three-layered transfer pricing documentation requirements in line with the international standard as per the BEPS Action Plan 13. Taxpayers are required to prepare a master file, local file, and CbC report from financial year 2016/17. The CBDT has notified the final rules for maintaining and furnishing of transfer pricing documentation in the master file and CbC report.
In case there are multiple entities of the same international group resident in India, one of the entities will have to be identified as the designated entity for filing the master file as well as for other communication in respect of the master file and the CbC report. Further, the rules have prescribed various forms for intimations to be filed with the prescribed authority and filing of the master file and CbC report with the prescribed authority at various dates. The due date for filing the master file is the specified due date for filing the annual tax returns. In case of CbC report, every parent entity or the alternate reporting entity, resident in India, will have to file the CbC report within a period of 12 months from the end of the said reporting accounting year of the parent entity. In case the Indian CE or the designated Indian CE is required to file the CbC report with the prescribed authority for reasons as discussed above, then the timeline is within a period of 12 months from the end of the international group’s reporting accounting year unless there has been a case of systemic failure, in which case the timeline is within six months from the end of the month in which said systemic failure was informed.
Significant penalty provisions will apply for non-compliance and furnishing of inaccurate information.
Further, on 27 June 2018, the CBDT issued an instruction relating to appropriate use of CbC report information. This instruction provides clarity on certain fundamental aspects of use of such information by the Indian tax authorities.
### Restrictions on interest deduction
The BEPS Action Plan 4 recommends alternate approaches for countries to limit tax base erosion through interest deductions and other financial payments. Provisions have been introduced in the Income-tax Act that seek to limit the interest deduction of Indian companies or PEs of foreign companies in India. Taxpayers engaged in banking or insurance business are specifically excluded. Further, it is clarified that interest on loan extended by a PE of a non-resident bank is also excluded. Recently, *vide* the Union Budget 2024, finance companies located in an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) have also been excluded from the purview of limitation on interest deduction.
The provision will apply to interest or similar expenses paid (including those paid on existing debt) to (i) overseas associated enterprises or (ii) third-party lenders for whom the underlying debt is backed by an implicit or explicit guarantee or equivalent deposit from overseas associated enterprises.
Any interest paid for the year under consideration in excess of 30% of the EBITDA of the taxpayer will be treated as excess interest. Excess interest disallowed in a year will be eligible for carry forward up to eight consecutive years, subject to the above limits. The provision will, however, not apply to interest paid or payable up to INR 10 million.
The provisions that limit the interest deductions have largely adopted the ‘Fixed Ratio Rule’ proposed as a best practice approach under BEPS Action Plan 4, however, with some differences. It is relevant to note that the provisions do not correspondingly limit the WHT liability or taxability of the non-resident associated enterprise on the interest income. The provisions apply from tax year 2018/19 onwards.
### Secondary adjustment
To align the ITPR with the OECD Guidelines and international practices, provisions have been introduced in the ITPR for a secondary adjustment. The secondary adjustment is an adjustment in the books of account of the taxpayer and its associated enterprise to reflect that the actual allocation of profits between the Indian taxpayer and its associated enterprise are consistent with the transfer price determined as a result of primary adjustment. This is intended to remove the imbalance between the cash account and actual profit of the Indian taxpayer.
The secondary adjustment is required only where a primary adjustment to the transfer price occurs in one of the following circumstances:
However, an exception has been made according to which such secondary adjustments shall not be carried out by the taxpayer if the amount of the primary adjustment made in the case of a taxpayer does not exceed INR 10 million.
According to this provision, excess money arising from primary transfer pricing adjustments not repatriated into India within the prescribed time limit will be deemed as an advance made by the Indian taxpayer to its associated enterprise. Time limits have been prescribed having regard to the circumstance leading to the primary transfer pricing adjustment. The effect of the advance is given by way of an imputation of interest on such advance.  The imputed per annum interest on such advance will be computed at the one-year marginal cost of fund lending rate of the State Bank of India as on 1 April of the relevant previous year plus a spread of 325 basis points in cases where the international transaction is denominated in Indian rupees. In cases where the international transaction is denominated in foreign currency, the interest will be computed at six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of 30 September of the relevant previous year plus a spread of 300 basis points. This interest will be imputed till such time as the excess money arising due to primary transfer pricing adjustments is repatriated into India.
The provisions relating to secondary transfer pricing adjustment are generally applicable for primary transfer pricing adjustments made from tax year 2017/18 onwards.
Further, it has been clarified that this interest will be computed on excess money or part thereof. Further, the excess money may be repatriated from any of the associated enterprises of the taxpayer that is not a resident of India. These amendments are effective retrospectively from 1 April 2018 (i.e. for tax year 2018/19 onwards).
Also, it has been clarified that the provisions of this section are applicable to APAs signed on or after 1 April 2017. Further, no refund of taxes paid till date under the pre-amended section will be allowed.
Moreover, to simplify the implementation of these provisions, an option has been introduced to taxpayers to either pay tax on the imputed interest every year until the excess money arising due to primary transfer pricing adjustments is repatriated into India or pay a one-time tax on the excess money or the part thereof at 18% plus surcharge of 12% and cess of 4%. Interest will have to be paid till the date of payment of the additional tax. Further, no credit will be given for this additional tax paid, neither will a deduction be allowed under any provision of the Act, in respect of such amount on which the tax has been paid. This has been effective from 1 September 2019 onwards. The aforesaid is in line with the internationally accepted best practices.
#### Significant development
Minimum alternate tax provisions have been amended to provide for adjustment for increase in book profit of the previous year due to inclusion of income of past year/years pursuant to an APA or secondary adjustment. The Tax Officer shall make the aforesaid adjustment and recompute the book profit of past year/years and the tax payable, if any, for the previous year, provided an application in this regard is made by the taxpayer and having regard to other conditions/provisions prescribed.
### Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)
India has the MAP process in place as a dispute resolution mechanism under the DTAAs. There are specific provisions within the Indian Tax Law for the same. With a view to align the MAP process with the OECD BEPS Action 14 Minimum Standard and provide more clarity around the MAP process, the Indian government amended the MAP rules in May 2020 with specific procedures for filing MAPs and notification to the foreign competent authority, along with an aim to resolve the MAP cases within an average timeline of 24 months. Further, in August 2020, the CBDT issued detailed guidance around procedural and technical aspects, acceptance/denial of MAPs, and the implementation of MAPs. On 10 June 2022, the CBDT released an updated version of the guidance on MAP wherein it clarified the interplay between MAP and the Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Act, 2020. It also elaborated on the MAP applicant’s responsibility to make true and complete disclosure during the MAP process.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Tax incentive provisions normally have conditions applicable for the period within which the preferred activity should be undertaken and the period for which the tax incentive is available. It may also be necessary to fulfil certain other conditions, such as ‘forming’ of a ‘new’ undertaking.
## Tax framework for start-ups in India
With a view to providing an impetus to start-ups and to facilitate their growth in the initial phase of their business, a deduction of 100% of the profits and gains derived by an eligible start-up from a business involving innovation development, improvement of products, processes, or services, or a scalable business model with a high potential of employment generation or wealth creation will be available.
The benefit of 100% deduction of the profits derived from such business will be available for a period of three consecutive years out of ten years beginning from the year the start-up is incorporated.
Eligible start-up companies can carry forward losses and set off against income of a year if they satisfy either of the following two conditions: (i) at least 51% of beneficial shareholders in the year on incurrence of loss continue to hold shares in such start-up in the year of set-off, or (ii) the same shareholders in the year of incurrence of loss continue to hold their shares in such start-up in the year of set-off (irrespective of their percent of holding). Further, only the losses incurred during the period of ten years beginning from the year in which such company was incorporated may be used for set-off.
‘Eligible start-up’ means a company or an LLP engaged in the business mentioned above and which fulfils the following conditions, namely:
## Other reliefs to start-ups
### Capital gain exemption to individual/Hindu undivided family (HUF) on investment in start-ups
Currently, the law, subject to certain conditions, provides for capital gains exemption to an individual/HUF on sale of a residential property (a house or a plot of land), provided that the net consideration received is invested for subscription of equity shares of eligible companies (including eligible start-ups) and such funds are utilised by the eligible companies for purchase of new assets.
### Compliance with the notification of exemption
Currently, notified companies (start-up companies) are exempted from taxability of consideration received for issue of shares, in excess of the FMV of such shares, subject to fulfilment of certain specified conditions.
Exemption will be withdrawn if the company fails to comply with any of the specified conditions and the income will be liable to tax in the year of such failure.
## Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)/Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has enacted regulations relating to two categories of investment vehicles, namely REITs and InvITs.
Pass-through status is provided to REITs in respect of income earned from renting, leasing, or letting out any real estate asset owned directly by the REITs. Thus, rental income is exempt in the hands of REITs. On distribution of rental income, REITs are required to withhold tax at the rate of 10% on income distributed to resident investors and at rates in force on income distributed to non-resident investors. Tax is not required to be withheld by tenants on payment of rent to the REITs.
The interest paid by special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to business trusts (BTs) (where BT holds controlling interest in SPV) is taxable at the investor level (as against the BT itself) when the BT distributes such amounts. Interest income to non-resident investors is taxable at a lower rate of 5% (plus applicable surcharge and cess), whereas residents are taxable at the applicable tax rates.
Dividends distributed by SPVs to the BTs are exempt in the hands of the BTs (where BT holds controlling interest in SPV). Further, dividends distributed to investors by REITs/InvITs are exempt in the hands of the unitholder if the SPV distributing such dividends to the REIT/InvIT does not opt for a lower corporate tax regime (i.e. the 22% tax rate exclusive of surcharge and cess).
Any capital repayment of debt by a BT should be taxable as income from other sources in the hands of unitholders at the applicable rates (with effect from 1 April 2023).
The prescribed mechanism to compute taxable amount (distributions representing capital repayment of debt) is provided below:
Taxable amount = A - B - C
(If taxable amount is negative, it shall be deemed to be zero)
A = Aggregate distributions representing capital repayment of debt (including distributions representing capital repayment of debt in the current year or previous years to existing unitholder or to a unitholder who held the unit in earlier years).
B = Amount at which such unit was issued by the BT.
C = Amount charged to tax under this clause in any earlier years.
Cost of acquisition of units of BT shall be reduced by capital repayment of debt that is not chargeable to tax under the heading ‘income from other sources’. Any capital repayment of debt prior to 1 April 2023 shall reduce the cost of acquisition of units of the BT.
Capital gains (e.g. on sale of shares of SPVs) (other than gains chargeable under relevant provisions of the Income-tax Act) are taxable in the hands of BTs at the maximum marginal rate. Any other income is taxable at the maximum marginal rate at the BT level. Onward distributions of such income are exempt in the hands of the investors.
Transfer of units of BTs through stock exchanges are liable to STT, and long-term capital gains (period of holding > 36 months) over and above of INR 100,000 on such sale of units will be chargeable to tax at the rate of 10% (plus surcharge and cess). A lower rate of 15% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is applicable to short-term capital assets. Taxability of capital gains arising to sponsors on exchange of shares in SPVs with units of BTs is deferred to the time of disposal of such units by the sponsor. The applicability of MAT on gains arising from the swap of shares of the SPV for units of BT is deferred to the stage when the units are transferred by the BT. No capital gains tax exemption is available on the swap of other assets with units of BTs.
If a person receives tax exempt dividend on units of a BT within three months before the record date and transfers these units within nine months after the record date, loss on sale of such units, if any (to the extent of exempt dividend), shall be ignored for the purpose for computing income.
If a person receives bonus units of a BT within three months before the record date and transfers these units within nine months after the record date, loss on sale of such units, if any, shall be ignored for the purpose for computing income. Further, the loss ignored shall be considered as the cost of acquisition for the bonus units received.
## Tax incentives for undertakings other than infrastructure development undertakings
If certain conditions are met, a tax holiday is permitted on the profits earned by an undertaking engaged in any of the following:
The tax holiday periods range from five to ten years, and the percentage of the rebate is 30%, 50%, or 100% in initial years and 30% in the later years. The number of years constituting ‘initial’ and ‘later’ years varies from sector to sector.
## Tax incentives for development of affordable housing projects
A developer is eligible to claim 100% of deduction of the capital expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of development of projects qualifying as affordable housing projects as per specified criteria. However, the said deduction can be availed only on fulfilment of certain conditions. Some of the key conditions are:
## Tax incentives for exports
Export profit from a new undertaking, satisfying prescribed conditions and set up in an SEZ, is eligible for tax exemption of 100% for the first five years, from the year in which manufacturing commences, followed by a partial tax exemption of 50% for the next five years. A further tax exemption of 50% of the export profit for five years is also available after that, subject to an equal amount of profit being retained and transferred to a special reserve in the books of account. The said exemption is available on commencement of eligible business between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2020.
The Government has further extended the above due date of 31 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, provided that the letter of approval is issued by the SEZ authorities on or before 31 March 2020.
## Tax incentives for offshore banking units in an SEZ
A scheduled bank, or any bank incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside India, that has an offshore banking unit in an SEZ with a specified income that is subject to prescribed conditions is eligible for a tax exemption of 100% of the specified income for five consecutive years beginning from the year in which the permission under the Indian Banking Regulation Act, 1949  or permission or registration under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992) or any other relevant law was obtained and of 100% of the specified income for five consecutive years thereafter for the tax year commencing on or after 1 April 2023.
## International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) tax incentives
The following tax incentives are provided under the Indian domestic tax laws for units set up in an IFSC:
Other incentives:
- Bonds issued before 1 July 2023: 4% (plus applicable surcharge and cess).
- Bonds issued on or after 1 July 2023: 9% (plus applicable surcharge and cess).
## Tax Incentives for specified fund
The following incomes received by a specified fund (which refers to a specified Category III Alternative Investment Fund and investment division of a banking unit of a non-resident located in an IFSC) are exempt from tax:
## Safe harbour for offshore funds managed from India
To encourage the location of offshore fund managers in India, a specific regime has been laid down. In the case of an eligible investment fund, fund management activity carried out through an eligible fund manager acting on behalf of such fund will not constitute a business connection in India. An eligible investment fund will not be treated as resident in India merely because the eligible fund manager undertakes fund management activities in India. Offshore funds and fund managers are required to satisfy certain conditions to be eligible for the regime. Certain conditions are not applicable to funds set up by the government of a foreign state or the Central Bank of a foreign state, a sovereign fund, or such other funds as may be notified by the Government of India and subject to fulfilment of conditions as may be specified. Further, the special regime will be applied in accordance with guidelines and in such manner as the administrative board may prescribe. Further, in respect of eligible investment fund and eligible fund manager located in an IFSC, the Central Government may relax one or more conditions in the future by way of a notification.
## Patent Box Regime
To encourage companies to locate high-value jobs associated with the development, manufacture, and exploitation of patents in India, the government has introduced a concessional taxation regime for income from patents. Accordingly, income by way of royalty in respect of a patent developed and registered in India earned by an eligible taxpayer will be subject to tax at the rate of 10% (plus surcharge and cess) on a gross basis with no allowance of expenditure incurred on royalty income.
An eligible taxpayer means a person resident in India, who is the true and first inventor of the invention, and whose name is entered on the patent register as the patentee.

## Mergers and acquisitions
The expression ‘merger’ has not been defined in the Income-tax Act but has been covered as part of the definition of the term 'amalgamation'. Amalgamation is defined as a merger of one or more companies with another, or the merger of two or more companies to form a new company, in such a way that all the assets and liabilities of the amalgamating company or companies become the assets and liabilities of the amalgamated company, are held by the amalgamated company for a minimum period of five years, and shareholders holding not less than 75% in value of the shares in the amalgamating company or companies become shareholders of the amalgamated company. In case of demerger, the cost of acquisition and period of holding of the assets related to the demerged company will be available to the resulting company.
### Capital gains
No capital gains tax is levied on the transfer of capital assets by an amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, provided the amalgamated company is an Indian company. Similar is the position in case of a demerger by a demerged company to a resulting company.
In cases where shares of an Indian company are transferred by a foreign company or a demerged foreign company to another foreign company or resulting foreign company, there is no tax payable, provided it satisfies certain specified conditions. Furthermore, the shareholder of the amalgamating company or demerged company is not liable to pay capital gains tax on the exchange of shares with that of the amalgamating company or the resulting company under the scheme of amalgamation.
Conversion of a bond or debenture of a company into equity shares is specifically exempt from capital gains tax. Furthermore, conversion of preference shares to equity shares will now be exempt from capital gains tax. The cost of acquisition and period of holding of the preference shares will be considered while determining the cost of acquisition and period of holding of equity shares acquired on such conversion. This is effective from tax year 2018/19 onwards.
## Inter-governmental agreements (IGAs)
The Indian government has signed an IGA with the United States (US) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in India. According to the IGA, foreign financial institutions (FFIs) in India are required to report tax information about US account holders to the Indian government, which will, in turn, relay the information about Indian account holders to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Furthermore, the US IRS will provide similar information about Indian citizens having any accounts or assets in the United States. This automatic exchange of information began from 30 September 2015. Subsequent to the signing of the IGA, the Indian government enacted rules relating to FATCA reporting in India.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Alternate tax regime
The optional alternate personal tax regime, devoid of any deductions or exemptions, which was made the default tax regime effective 1 April 2023, continuous to be the default tax regime unless an individual chooses otherwise. Moreover, the tax rates under this regime have been revised. A rebate of 100% income tax has been allowed for resident individuals where total income does not exceed 700,000 Indian rupees (INR). The amount of the standard deduction available to a salaried taxpayer has been enhanced from INR 50,000 to INR 75,000. *See the corresponding sections of India’s individual tax summary for details*.
The taxpayers who want to opt for the old tax regime have to specifically indicate this preference in the manner as prescribed.
## Increased withholding tax (WHT) rate for royalty and fee for technical service (FTS) payments made to non-residents
The 10% special tax rate, as provided under the domestic tax laws, on royalty and FTS income earned by a non-resident or a foreign company that does not have permanent establishment (PE) in India was increased to 20%. Accordingly, royalty/FTS incomes that are chargeable to tax for a non-resident on or after 1 April 2023 will require tax to be deducted at the rate of 20% plus applicable surcharge and cess under the domestic tax laws.
However, non-residents or foreign companies can still avail the benefit of a lower tax rate provided in the tax treaties, subject to compliance with the treaty eligibility conditions.
## E-filing of Form 10F without Permanent Account Number (PAN) enabled
In order to be eligible to claim the tax treaty benefits, a non-resident is, *inter alia*, required to furnish certain details in Form 10F. The said form is required to be filed electronically on the income tax portal. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has enabled non-residents, who do not have a PAN (i.e. tax identification number) and are not required to have a PAN, to e-file Form 10F on the income tax portal by creating an account without the requirement of first obtaining a PAN.
## Withdrawal of small outstanding direct tax demands
In the Interim Budget 2024-25, the Finance Minister announced withdrawal of petty, non-verified, non-reconciled, or disputed tax demands under the Income-tax Act, 1961, Wealth-tax Act, 1957 and Gift-tax Act, 1958 (relevant Act). To bring this into effect, the CBDT has issued an order broadly providing the following guidelines/conditions based on which the tax demands will be withdrawn:
## Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, 2024
With the objective of reducing litigation and settling pending disputes, the government of India has decided to introduce a Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, 2024 (VsV Scheme, 2024). This scheme provides for a dispute settlement mechanism pursuant to which eligible taxpayers can settle their pending tax disputes by paying a specified portion of the tax arrears. It is noteworthy that the provisions of this scheme are largely aligned with the earlier Vivad se Vishwas Scheme of 2020.
Taxpayers should consider reviewing their pending income tax litigation and, based on the likelihood of success and estimated cost of continuing the litigation, decide whether to opt for the VsV Scheme, 2024.

## Treatment of business entities
An individual has various options for conducting business in India. An individual can opt for forming a proprietary concern, can be a partner in a partnership firm, can be a partner in a limited liability partnership, can create a limited liability partnership, can create and become a member of an association of persons, or can create and be part of a body of individuals. The tax law has different provisions for taxing and assessing different types of entities.
## Inter-Governmental Agreements (IGAs)
The government of India has signed an IGA with the United States (US) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in India. According to the IGA read with the FATCA provisions, foreign financial institutions in India are required to report tax information about US account holders to the Indian government which will, in turn, relay that information to the US Internal Revenue Service (US IRS). Further, the US IRS will provide similar information about Indian citizens having any accounts or assets in the United States. This automatic exchange of information has begun from 30 September 2015. Subsequent to the signing of the IGA, the Indian government enacted rules and prescribed forms relating to FATCA reporting in India.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Employment income
An individual’s entire remuneration/salary received from an employer for services rendered in India is taxable in India. Taxable income includes all amounts, whether in cash or in kind, arising from an office of employment.
Apart from the salary, fees, bonuses, and commissions, some of the most common remuneration items are allowances, reimbursement of personal expenses, education payment, and perquisites or benefits provided by the employer either free of cost or at concessional rate. All such payments are included, whether paid directly to employees or on their behalf.
Reimbursement of expenses actually incurred wholly, necessarily, and exclusively in the performance of official duties is not included in taxable salary. However, concessional treatment is accorded to housing benefit, car facility, and certain retirement benefits. Certain allowances and benefits paid or provided by an employer, like house rent allowance (instead of housing benefit) and leave travel allowance, are treated as exempt, subject to applicable conditions and limits, and are, accordingly, not included in the computation of income.
Employer’s contribution to a recognised provident fund of up to 12% of employee’s salary is tax exempt in the year of contribution.
Effective 1 April 2020, if the aggregate amount of an employer’s contribution to an approved superannuation fund, recognised provident fund, and national pension scheme exceeds INR 750,000, it will be taxable as perquisites in the hands of the employee. Further, annual accretions on such employer contributions by way of interest, dividend, or any other amount of a similar nature will also be taxed as perquisites in the hands of the employee. The Revenue Department has prescribed a formula for calculation of annual accretion as defined above.
Interest accrued on an individual’s own provident fund contribution made in excess of INR 250,000 from tax year 2021/22 onwards is to be taxable. In August 2021, the Revenue Department prescribed rules that describe the detailed steps of calculating the taxable amount in respect of interest accrued on an employee’s contribution in the provident fund account exceeding INR 250,000 (INR 500,000 if there is no employer contribution), effective FY 2021/22. The provident fund authorities are required to maintain separate accounts for ‘taxable’ and ‘non-taxable’ contributions made by the employee. Interest accrued in the ‘non-taxable’ account will not be subject to tax, and interest accrued on the ‘taxable’ account will be subject to tax.
An employee holding a foreign passport and employed by a foreign enterprise, who is not present in India for more than 90 days in a tax year, is not taxed on remuneration received from the foreign employer for services performed in India, provided the foreign enterprise is not engaged in any trade or business in India, and the remuneration is not deductible in computing the employer’s taxable income in India. The tax treaties entered into by India also provide short stay exemption wherein the 90-days period (*as discussed above*) is replaced by 183 days and two other conditions (i.e. remuneration received from an employer who is not a resident of India and where the salary is not borne by a permanent establishment of the overseas employer in India are provided on similar lines in many cases). The benefit under the tax treaty is extended to all individuals, including foreign citizens.
## Equity compensation
Value of any specified security or sweat equity shares allotted or transferred directly or indirectly by the employer or former employer, free of cost or at a concessional rate, is taxable as perquisite in the hands of the employee. The valuation for this purpose is to be done on the basis of the FMV of the specified security or sweat equity share on the date when the option is exercised (i.e. allotment) by the employee as reduced by the amount recovered from the employee.
As per the income-tax rules, FMV will be the average of the opening price and closing price of the share on the date of exercise by the employee on the recognised stock exchange of India on which such shares are listed. In cases where the shares are listed on more than one recognised stock exchange of India, then FMV will be the average of the opening price and closing price of the share on the date of exercise by the employee on the recognised stock exchange that records the highest volume of trading in the share on such date.
Further, in cases where there was no trading on the said date, then such FMV on the closest date, immediately preceding the date of exercise, will be considered. In cases where the shares are not listed on the recognised stock exchange in India, the FMV is to be determined by a Category I merchant banker in India registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The merchant banker valuation will be the date of exercise or a date earlier than the date of exercise of the option, but not being a date that is more than 180 days earlier than the date of exercise.
Further, in case of sale of shares by the employees, capital gains may arise and the same will be taxable in the hands of the employees. The taxes on capital gains have to be paid by the employees depending on the residential status in the relevant tax year.
Effective 1 April 2020, taxation of any specified security or sweat equity shares that is taxable as perquisite in the hands of employees of eligible start-ups has been deferred. The tax is now required to be deducted/paid within 14 days from the earliest of the following events:
This relaxation has been provided to ease the burden of cash outflow on employees of such start-ups arising at the time of exercise of such securities.
## Income from business or profession
Profits and gains from a business or profession carried out by an individual are taxable in India, subject to certain deductions and allowance of depreciation and business expenses.
The following income, *inter alia,* is taxable in the hands of an individual:
Note that the share of profit from a partnership firm is not taxed in the hands of the partner since it is paid out of the post-tax profits of the partnership firm.
### Presumptive taxation scheme for persons having income from a profession (other than business income)
Income of a taxpayer who is engaged in a specified profession, such as legal, medical, engineering, or architectural profession or the profession of accountancy or technical consultancy or interior decoration or any other profession, and whose total gross receipts does not exceed INR 5 million in a tax year (effective from tax year 2024/25, such limit will be enhanced to INR 7.5 million if at least 95% of the receipts are through online mode) is estimated at a sum equal to 50% of the total gross receipts. In other words, if the total turnover or gross receipt of the profession exceeds INR 5 million, then the scheme cannot be adopted. The scheme will apply to such resident taxpayer who is an individual, HUF, or partnership firm, but not a limited liability partnership firm. Under this scheme, the taxpayer will be deemed to have been allowed all the business expenses that he/she is otherwise eligible to claim. The taxpayer is not required to maintain books of accounts and get them audited unless the taxpayer claims profits and gains from the aforesaid profession are lower than the profits and gains deemed to be his/her income and the taxpayer’s income exceeds the maximum amount that is not chargeable to income-tax.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Previously, dividend income received from an Indian company was not taxable in the hands of the shareholder if dividend distribution tax (DDT) had been paid on the same by the company. This was applicable to resident as well as NR shareholders.
However, dividend income in excess of INR 1 million was chargeable to tax in the case of an individual, HUF, or a firm that is a resident in India at the rate of 10%. Also, dividend income received from an SEBI-registered Indian mutual fund was not taxable in the hands of recipient. This applied to resident as well as NR shareholders.
Effective 1 April 2020, dividend will now be taxed in the hands of the shareholders or unit holders at the applicable rates, and, correspondingly, the domestic company or mutual fund will not be required to pay any tax on distribution of income.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxable in India. A deduction of up to INR 10,000 is allowed in respect of savings bank interest on deposits (not being time deposits) with specified banking companies registered with the banking authority/cooperative societies engaged in carrying on business of banking/post office in India.
Further, the exemption limit on interest income for resident senior citizens is INR 50,000. Interest income will also include interest earned from fixed deposits and recurring deposits.
## Rental income
Any income earned from the letting-out, or renting, of any building, or land appurtenant thereto, is taxable as ‘income from house property’ in the hands of the individual. The tax is levied on the annual value of the property computed in terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act. Deduction of municipal taxes paid during the year (irrespective of the year to which the expense pertains) and a standard deduction at the rate of 30% is available on the gross annual value while computing the ‘income from house property’.
If an individual owns two or more house properties for his/her use, then such individual may exercise an option to treat any two house properties as self-occupied. The remaining house property(ies), if any, are deemed to be let-out, and a notional rent as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act is computed as the taxable income under the head ‘income from house property’. In other words, the third house property is treated as let-out and an expected rental income is treated as taxable income.
### Deduction on housing loan interest
Income from house property will be reduced by the amount of interest paid on borrowed capital where the loan has been taken for the purpose of purchase/construction/repair/renewal/reconstruction of the residential house property. However, no deduction will be allowed unless the individual furnishes a certificate from the person to whom the interest is payable on the capital borrowed, specifying the amount of interest payable by the taxpayer for the purpose of such acquisition or construction, etc. of the property.
Deduction on housing loan can be claimed once the construction is completed and possession of the property has been obtained. The law provides a deferred deduction on the interest payable during pre-construction period (i.e. period prior to the tax year in which the property has been acquired or constructed). The deduction on such interest is available equally over a period of five tax years starting from the year acquired/constructed.
### Maximum limit of deduction of interest
In case the house property is not let out during the year, the maximum amount of interest that can be claimed as deduction is limited to INR 200,000, subject to conditions that the loan is taken on or after 1 April 1999 for the purpose of purchase or construction and such property is acquired or constructed within five years from the end of year in which loan is taken. For all other cases, where the house property is not let out, the maximum amount that can be claimed as deduction is limited to INR 30,000.
In case a house property is let out during the tax year (including deemed to be let out), there is no restriction on the maximum amount of interest that can be claimed as deduction.
### Interest in excess of taxable rental income
Individuals, subsequent to claiming deduction of interest as per the above-mentioned prescribed limits, can set off loss under the head house property (due to claim of excess interest) from any other head of income up to a maximum of INR 200,000. Any unabsorbed loss under the head of house property will be carried forward for the next eight tax years and will be eligible to be set off against the income from house property only.
## Exempt income
Certain income is eligible to be claimed as exempt from taxable income. The exemption can be based on income or investment. Some of them are detailed below:

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
An individual is said to be a resident in the tax year if he/she is:
If none of the above two conditions are met, the individual is said to be an NR in that tax year.
Example:
A resident individual is treated as RNOR if he/she satisfies any one of the following conditions:
A resident individual not satisfying both of the above conditions is treated as ROR.
Example:
If an expatriate stays in India for 300 days for each of three tax years, then he/she will not qualify as RNOR in the fourth year because of the following reasons:
In determining the physical presence of individuals in India, it is not essential that their stay in the country needs to be continuous or at the same place.
Furthermore, their date of arrival in India and date of departure from it may be considered as their period of stay in the country. The purpose of their residence in India is irrelevant, and even if it is for a visit to their families or tourism, it is counted as a stay in India for residency purposes.
In effect, a newcomer to India normally remains an NR/RNOR for the first two to three tax years of stay in India.
\*The rules are slightly more liberal for a person who is of Indian origin or an Indian citizen residing abroad and visiting India, or who is an Indian citizen and leaves India for employment abroad.
Effective 1 April 2020, an Indian citizen or person of India origin who, being outside India, comes on a visit to India and whose India-sourced taxable income exceeds INR 1.5 million during the relevant tax year will qualify as a resident of India only if physically present in India for 120 days or more during that tax year and 365 days or more during the previous four tax years immediately preceding the relevant tax year. Further, such an individual will qualify as RNOR if the total stay in India during the relevant tax year is 120 days or more but less than 182 days.
## Deemed resident
An Indian citizen having India-sourced taxable income exceeding INR 1.5 million during the relevant tax year will be deemed to be a resident of India if one is not liable to tax in any other country by reason of domicile or residence or any other criteria of similar nature. Further, such an individual will qualify as RNOR in India for the relevant tax year.
The above rule of determining a person as a 'deemed resident' of India will only be applicable where the normal rule of residency based on the individual's physical presence in India during the relevant previous year and/or past four tax years is not applicable.
For the purpose of residency in India, the expression 'India-sourced taxable income' will include income deemed to accrue or arise in India.
To provide more clarity on the applicability of this provision, the definition of the term 'liable to tax' is introduced, which means that there is a liability of tax on the person under any law for the time being in force in any country and also includes cases where, subsequent to imposition of tax liability, an exemption has been provided.
