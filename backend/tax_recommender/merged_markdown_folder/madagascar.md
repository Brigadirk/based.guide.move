# Madagascar
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Madagascar is an island nation along the southeast coast of Africa. Formerly an independent kingdom, it became a French colony in 1896 but regained independence in 1960. Madagascar is a constitutional democracy divided into 23 regions, with Antananarivo as the capital. Malagasy and French are the official languages of Madagascar, and the currency is the Malagasy ariary (MGA).
After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s, Madagascar has followed a World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) led policy of privatisation and liberalisation. This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of gross domestic product (GDP) and employing 80% of the population.

## Taxable period
The financial year may be spread over any period of 12 months. There is no need to obtain prior authorisation in order to close the financial year on a date other than 31 December or 30 June.
## Tax returns
CIT returns are due before 15 May each year for companies whose financial year ends at 31 December, before 15 November each year for companies whose financial year ends at 30 June, and no later than the 15th day of the fourth month from the date of closing of the financial year for all other year-ends.
Taxpayers having annual revenue of more than MGA 200 million must file annual financial statements online.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable bimonthly in provisional instalments. The balance is payable before 15 May each year for companies whose financial year ends at 31 December, before 15 November each year for companies whose financial year ends at 30 June, and within four months from the date of closing of the financial year for all other year-ends.
Taxpayers can decide to suspend the payment of bimonthly income tax instalments, but they must pay a penalty of 80% if the final tax due is more than the previous year's income tax. However, if the amount actually due is less than the instalments paid, the overpayment entitles the taxpayer to a tax credit that can be applied to taxes of the same kind.
WHT on foreign services is payable to the tax authorities before the 15th day of the month following the payment.
WHT on purchase of goods and services from non-registered suppliers is payable to the tax authorities before the 15th day of the month following the payment.
WHT on interest and on payments to members of boards of directors is payable to the tax authorities before the 15th day of the month following the payment.
WHT on dividends is payable to the tax authorities before the 15th day of the month following the payment.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities carry out audits of a selection of tax returns, usually at the taxpayer’s place of business. Audits may be carried out at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.
After examination of available information, the tax authorities issue a primary notice, and the taxpayer has 30 days after the date of reception of the primary notice to answer and submit its written objection to the tax authorities. A contradictory debate is organised.
When new elements are noted by tax authorities following the taxpayer's response and the contradictory debate, a second initial notification is given. This second primary notification is followed by another contradictory debate.
The tax authorities then issue the final notification accompanied with the perception title.
The taxpayer may request the opinion of the Tax Commission (CoFi) of not.
If the taxpayer requests the CoFi's opinion, the taxpayer has 15 days from the notice of the final notification accompanied with the perception title to file the request. The CoFI will have 30 days to issue its opinion. After obtaining the CoFi's opinion, the tax authorities will issue the final decision within 60 days.
If taxpayer does not request the CoFi’s opinion, the taxpayer has 30 days from the notice of the final notification accompanied with the perception title to file a claim to the tax authorities. The tax authorities have 60 days to issue their decision.
The decision of the tax authorities may be further appealed to the Court (State Council) within 30 days.
## Statute of limitations
The tax limitation period is three years.
Areas where tax authorities usually claim adjustment are:

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate is 20%, and the VAT rate on export is 0%. VAT input is recoverable under certain conditions.
The VAT rate of 10% is applicable for locally produced butane gas.
VAT is applicable to all transactions related to any services performed in Madagascar by a corporate entity with turnover equal to or more than MGA 400 million.
Services are considered to be performed in Madagascar if such services are executed in Madagascar, used in Madagascar, or invoiced to a taxpayer established in Madagascar.
There is no VAT registration threshold for a non-resident supplier. A foreign company that has no PE in Madagascar but renders services to a Madagascar taxpayer is taxable to VAT. The foreign company should appoint a tax representative to collect and pay VAT on its behalf. In the absence of such tax representative, the recipient or business consumer in Madagascar is liable to account for VAT on the services.
VAT is generally chargeable on:
In the absence of information to the contrary, prices are deemed to be inclusive of VAT. Supplier invoices should mention clearly the amount of VAT in order to allow the recipient to deduct VAT input tax. Any payment between two VAT payers must be executed by way of bank transaction (e.g. bank cheque, bank card, mobile banking).
VAT collected by the supplier can be credited against VAT output. If output tax is not sufficient to offset input tax, then the difference constitutes a VAT credit. A VAT credit can be carried forward on the following monthly deadlines.
Only free zone companies, export professionals, approved credit-lessors, and companies subject to VAT making investments can claim for VAT refund. VAT refund is extended to VAT paid by oil and gas entities on their importation of services under certain conditions.

Registration fee rates are 0.5% to 5%, depending on the nature of the transaction. The rate of 5% is applicable mainly on transfers of assets and transfers of business. In the event of the existence of a suspensive condition, it is required to inform the competent tax office of the fulfillment of this condition within two months of its date.
A registration fee of 0.5% of share capital is applicable to registration of a new company.
In the event of an extension of the life of the company, a registration fee of 0.5% is calculated on the basis of the net assets shown in the balance sheet at the end of the financial year preceding the decision to extend.

## Tax returns
### IRSA
The tax on salary and all statutory social contributions are withheld monthly by the employer, who is responsible for tax filing and payment. Employees are not required to file individual tax returns unless they work for an employer that is not established in Madagascar. If the employee does not have any business income, there is no requirement to file for IR.
### IR
Small business income tax returns must be filed with the tax office by 31 March of each year. For taxpayers with a tax year spanning two years, the deadline is no later than the end of the third month following the end of the fiscal year.
IR returns for large individual businesses must be filed before 15 May of each year for businesses having financial years ended on 31 December, before 15 November of each year for businesses having financial years ended on 30 June, and within 15 days of the fourth month of the end of financial year for other businesses.
## Payment of tax
### IRSA
Payment of IRSA must be done before the 15th day of each month. Payment of social tax contributions must be done quarterly.
### IR
Payment of IR must be done at the same time as the tax return filing and at the same office.
### WHT
WHT on foreign services is payable to the tax authorities before the 15th day of the month following the payment.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Individuals are subject to business income tax, called *Impôt sur les Revenus* (IR), or to salary income tax, called *Impôt sur les Revenus Salariaux et Assimilés* (IRSA), depending on the nature of the revenue earned.
For IRSA purposes, an individual resident in Madagascar, either Malagasy or of a foreign nationality, is liable on worldwide income.
For IR purposes, an individual who is not resident in Madagascar is liable only on income from Malagasy sources.
## Salary income tax (IRSA)
IRSA scale:
In all cases, regardless of the income, the minimum salary income tax payable is MGA 3,000.
## Individual business income tax (IR)
An individual business having an annual turnover of less than MGA 400 million is subject to IR at a rate of 5% (with a possible reduction of 70%) of the annual turnover, called 'synthetic tax'. However, the minimum tax is MGA 16,000 or MGA 150,000, depending on the activity.
Basic producers, such as farmers, foresters, and intermediaries operating with the said producers in the sales chain, are subject to synthetic tax on their income from their activities regardless of the MGA 400 million threshold.
Individual members of cooperative societies are personally subject to IR (income tax) or to synthetic tax.

## Reform of the General Tax Code introduced in the 2023 Financial Law
The reform consists of the extraction of procedural tax provisions from the General Tax Code. From January 2023, the General Tax Code is split into:
## New tax from 2025: Mobile transaction tax
From 2025, any operation related to the use of electronic money is subject to Mobile transaction tax at a rate of 5% of the transaction fees excluding tax.
## VAT credit deferral limited to 3 years
From 2025, VAT credit can be carried forward over 3 years, instead of indefinitely previously
## Tax audit process
From 2025, some modifications have been made in respect of tax audit process, mainly concerning concerning response timing and the request for deferral of payment in the event of a contentious claim.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Depreciation
The amount of deductible depreciation should not exceed the amount that is calculated according to the following rates of depreciation provided by the law:
| Asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Industrial buildings | 5 |
| Plant and machinery | 10 |
| Mining exploration and development (licence) | 33 |
| Transportation (car) | 20 |
| Transportation (utility cars, vans, trucks) | 25 |
| Computers | 25 |
| Electricity generators | 10 |
With the exception of buildings, it is also possible to practise a graduated depreciation. In this case, the annual depreciation corresponds to 30% of the net book value of the asset.
In case of loss, depreciation of assets can be deferred and carried forward to the next financial years until absorption.
## Goodwill
There is no provision concerning deductibility of goodwill in the Madagascar tax code.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific tax provision on start-up expenses. Accounting rules are applicable for the profit and loss recognition.
Start-up and prospecting expenses for the installation of an overseas establishment, as well as the costs of running such a foreign establishment, for the first three years are tax deductible. However, the amounts deducted must be reported, in equal amounts, to the taxable income of the five consecutive years from the fifth year following the creation of the foreign establishment.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible. However, interest on inter-company loans between companies within the same group is subject to thin capitalisation rules (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html)* *section for more information*). In addition, interest on inter-company loans and interest on intra-group cash advances are not deductible if the arrangement is not documented by a written agreement, ratified by the general meeting of shareholders and submitted according to registration procedures.
## Bad debt
To be tax-deductible, provisions for doubtful debt must be subject to justification of existence of amicable or judicial settlement. The claims must be individualised.
## Charitable contributions
Donations granted to foundations recognised as being of public utility by decree are also deductible subject to production of a Destination Certificate.
Gifts in kind or in cash granted in case of natural calamities and donations in cash granted to a corporation established by decree for the interest of the nation are also deductible.
Any other charitable contributions are not deductible.
## Deductible social expenses for mining companies
Donations and expenses related to the social responsibility of mining companies are deductible if they are mandatory or provided in the *Cahier des charges*.
Expenditures for site security and high intensity of manpower (*haute intensité de main d’oeuvre* or HIMO), provided that expenses were subject to WHT at a rate of 5%, are also deductible.
## Deductible wages
Salaries and wages that are not included in salary income taxes or not declared to *Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale* are not deductible.
Only 40% of the difference between the total benefits in kind and the value of benefits in kind included in the tax base of salary income tax are deductible expenses.
Expenses linked to any form of health coverage paid by the employer for the benefit of all its employees are deductible up to 10% of the payroll.
Internship allowances are deductible expenses.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
Except for CIT, taxes in relation to business in Madagascar are deductible.
Third-party taxes borne by the company are not tax-deductible.
## Net operating losses
Accumulated loss can be carried forward for the next five financial years following the period in which the loss occurs. Carryback of losses is not permitted in Madagascar.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
For branches, the deductible amount of overhead that the head office can charge to the branch is limited to 1% of the turnover of the branch.  *For interest on inter-company loans, see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html)**section*.
Charges linked to financial transactions between companies deemed to be related as per description by decree are deductible within the limit of:
## Payments to foreign companies established in a country having a very favourable fiscal regime
Payments made to a foreign company established in a country having a very favourable fiscal regime are not tax deductible unless there is proof of effectiveness of the services and reasonability of the amount.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
There is no provision regarding group taxation in Madagascar, except for the following:
For entities subject to the actual tax regime, a parent-subsidiary regime option is established by which the net dividends received by the parent company from its subsidiary are excluded from the tax base of the parent company. However, a share of fees and expenses, uniformly fixed at 5% of the amount of dividends paid, must be reintroduced into the tax base.
## Transfer pricing
There is a provision in the tax law allowing the tax authority to claim a tax adjustment in cases where the transactions between a Madagascar entity and a foreign entity controlling or controlled by the Madagascar entity are not concluded at fair market value.
The following transfer pricing methodologies are acceptable:
Effectiveness of services and fair market value must be justified by appropriate documentation.
Companies subject to the transfer pricing documentation reporting obligation are those carrying out intra-group transactions with a value greater than or equal to MGA 450 million meeting the following criteria:
Electronic file of transfer pricing documentation must be filed 90 days from the due date of the Communication Statement.
## Thin capitalisation
Under Malagasy tax law, deductible inter-company financial interest cannot exceed the interest calculated on twice the net equity at the rate of the Central Bank of Madagascar plus two points (the rate of the Central Bank of Madagascar is 9.5%). Such limitation is also applicable to interest paid to any company indirectly linked to the company but belonging to the same group.
Inter-company loan agreements must be submitted according to registration formalities within two months from the execution date. Failure of submission of an inter-company loan agreement according to registration formalities and of non ratification of the loan agreement by the annual general meeting of shareholders implies non-deductibility of interest on the inter-company loan.
## Dividends exclusion
95% of dividends received by a shareholder holding more than 75% share capital from its subsidiary are excluded from business revenue subject to income tax.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no special provision in relation to CFCs in Madagascar.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
The following activities benefit from a special tax and/or customs regime:
## Free zone (free trade zone)
Free zone law is available for industrial and other service providers that export all of their products. Taxation of free zone enterprise and free trade zone is provided from 2022 in the General Tax Law. If eligible under the free zone law, a CIT exemption is provided during the first two to five years and a reduced CIT of 10% is levied thereafter.
At the end of the exemption period, investments in assets depreciable over a period of at least three years, acquired new, are entitled to a tax reduction equal to the tax corresponding to 25% of the amount of the new investments. The right to reduction that can be used for the tax year cannot exceed 50% of tax actually due. The balance is carried forward with the same limitation to subsequent years, for a period not exceeding that of tax depreciation.
## Companies investing in renewable energy, tourism, industrial, civil work and construction, and transformation
Companies investing in renewable energy, tourism, industrial, civil work and construction, and transformation can benefit from a tax reduction equal to the tax calculated on 20% of the amount of investment that they realised during the related tax year. The right to reduction that can be used for the tax year cannot exceed 50% of tax actually due. The balance is carried forward with the same limitation to subsequent years, until clearance.
## Big investment mining
A mining company committing to invest more than 50 million United States dollars (USD) is considered a big investment mining company. The big investment mining law provides a minimum income tax exemption, a reduced CIT rate for the transformation entity (i.e. the entity in charge of processing the extracted minerals), exemption from custom and importation duties, and VAT reimbursement on locally purchased equipment and investments. Tax provisions applicable to Bing investment mining companies are from January 2025 included in the Tax Code.
## Petroleum code
## Leasing law
The leasing law provides that leasing activities can benefit from CIT exemption and reduction of tax rate during the first four years.
## Foreign tax credit
Except under a tax treaty, there is no foreign tax credit rule under Malagasy tax law.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Employment expenses
The following items are deductible from gross income for IRSA purposes:
## Personal allowances
In Madagascar, personal allowances from IRSA take the form of tax credits per dependant (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
## Business deductions
Where an individual derives income from a trade, business, or profession having an annual turnover exceeding MGA 400 million, expenses duly justified can be deducted from the taxable revenue for IR purposes.
If the annual revenue is less than MGA 400 million, a deduction of 30% is applicable on the gross revenue. However, the annual deduction cannot exceed MGA 2 million.
A tax reduction of 2% of the amount of purchases of goods and services and equipment subject to regular invoices and having been the subject of a declaration in the right of communication, of salaries and other employer charges, of health coverage expenditure within the limit of 5% of the payroll, and of donations in-kind or in-cash for the benefit of foundations recognised as being of public utility is applicable. However, tax due cannot be less than 3% of the turnover.
Please note that when an individual has more than 50% of the share capital of a company set up as a *société à responsabilité limitée* (Sarl) under the corporate law and at the same time is manager of the same company, only a deduction of MGA 4,2 million is applicable on the gross remuneration. The tax due cannot be less than MGA 1 million. A Sarl is a company set up by one or more shareholders and managed by one or more managers having, according to the law (unless limitation by the deed of appointment), separate and full power to sign on behalf of the company.
