## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Corporate income tax (CIT) is levied, currently at a 25% rate, on the profits deriving from business activities carried out in Angola by resident entities or non-resident entities with a tax permanent establishment (PE), as defined by Angolan domestic legislation.
Tax residents are taxed on worldwide profits, while PEs are liable to taxation on the profits attributable to the PE, sales in Angola of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind to that sold by the PE, and to any other business activity that is of the same or similar kind to that conducted by the PE.
The Angolan system has two tax regimes: the general regime and the simplified regime. The simplified regime applies to taxpayers subject to CIT who are in the VAT non-taxation regime (entities with business turnover below or equal to 25 million Angolan kwanza (AOA).
The following are excluded from the simplified regime:
Taxpayers who have been included in the simplified taxation regime may apply to join the general regime, if they meet the requirements to be included in it, and must submit their application to the relevant tax office by the end of February of the year to which the CIT relates.
The general regime applies to taxpayers whose revenue is over AOA 25 million for two consecutive or non-consecutive years.
Special tax regimes apply to the oil and gas industry and to the mining industry.
Exemptions from CIT are provided for non-resident shipping and airline operators (as long as reciprocity exists in the foreign jurisdiction).
## Investment Income Tax (IIT)
The IIT is due on interest, dividends, royalties, and other income of a similar nature. In Angola, the IIT Code divides such income into two sections, as follows:
### Section A
Section A includes:
The tax is due at the moment that the income starts to be due or is presumed to be due.
A minimum annual interest rate of 6% is deemed on loan agreements and credit facilities, except if another rate is proven through a written and stamped contract.
### Section B
Section B includes (amongst others):
The concept of royalties includes payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films, or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
### Exemptions
The following income is exempt from IIT:
### IIT rate
The IIT rate is generally 15%, except for certain income, for which the rate is 10% or 5%.
The tax rate is 10% for the following income (amongst others):
The tax rate is 5% for the following income (amongst others):
### Assessment and payment
IIT due on income falling in section A of the IIT Code is, as a general rule, assessed and paid by the beneficiary entity when filing the tax return in January of the year following the taxable events. If the beneficiary is a foreign entity, the obligation to assess and deliver usually falls on the Angolan resident entity that is paying the income.
IIT due on income falling in section B of the IIT Code is, as a general rule, withheld by the paying entity.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local taxes on income in Angola.

# Angola
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 14%, and VAT has a broad tax base.
The following reduced VAT rates are applicable to a specific set of transactions:
### The standard regime
Local entities with an annual turnover or an annual volume of import operations higher than AOA 350 million are liable to the standard VAT regime.
Entities operating in the manufacturing industry may be included in the standard VAT regime if in the previous year they had a turnover or import operations exceeding AOA 25 million.
Under this regime, taxpayers:
### The simplified regime
The simplified regime applies to taxpayers with an annual turnover or volume of import operations between AOA 25 million and AOA 350 million.
Under this regime, taxpayers:
Taxpayers under the simplified regime may opt to be included in the standard VAT regime if all the following requirements are fulfilled:
When changing from the simplified to the standard VAT regime, the entity is allowed to deduct 90% of the VAT incurred in goods to be sold that have been acquired in the 12 months preceding the change and upon authorisation from the Angola tax authorities.
### Exemptions
The following supplies are VAT exempt:
Imported goods intended as gifts for philanthropic purposes or to mitigate the effects of natural disasters, namely droughts, floods, storms, cyclones, earthquakes, pandemics, and others of an identical nature are exempt from VAT, provided that the respective purpose is duly recognised by the General Tax Administration (*Administração Geral Tributária* or AGT).
### Zero-rated VAT
Exports of goods, supplies of goods and service to meet the direct needs of vessels and aircraft engaged in commercial activity, and international transport of passengers are zero rated.
### Captivation regime
The state (not including public companies) and oil investing companies are obliged to captivate 100% of the VAT charged by their suppliers. The Angolan National Bank, commercial banks, insurers and reinsurers, and telecommunication operators, duly licensed, captivate 50% of the VAT. The VAT captivated is withheld and reported as output VAT in the VAT returns of the entity that has captivated.
The captivation regime does not apply to the following transactions:
If the invoice is paid and the customer does not captive the VAT, the obligation to pay the VAT is transferred to the supplier.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied on imports at *ad valorem* rates varying from 2% to 55%.
The export of goods that are not produced in Angola is subject to customs duties at the rate of 20% plus customs fees (at rate of 0.5%) computed on the customs value, with the exception of goods covered by the Customs Regime Applicable to the Petroleum and Mining Sectors.
The export of nationalised food, medicine, medical equipment, and biosafety goods are subject to customs duties at the rate of 70%, calculated on the customs value.
A special exemption regime applies for the oil industry.
## Excise duties
From 1 October 2019 onwards, excise duty entered into force in Angola. However, the Excise Duties Code was updated in July 2021 by the Law 16/21, of 19 July 2021, in force until now.
All production, imports, and sales by public auction are subject to excise duty, with different rates of 2%,3%, 4%, 5%, 8%, 15%, 19%, 20%, 25%, and 50%, depending on the product.
The Excise Duty Code covers operations with the following products:
The taxable amount subject to excise duty is as follows:
Producers are required to assess the excise duties when products are made available to buyers/customers and must submit them electronically by the last working day of each month.
The Excise Duties Code also provides for some exemptions, including:
The tax stamp is mandatory, according to the model approved by a specific Diploma, to manufactured beverages, tobacco, and its substitutes, referred to in Annex I of this Law.
The establishments that produce beverages, tobacco, and its manufactured substitutes and petroleum products, referred to in Annexes I and II of this Law, must be equipped with a counting and measuring system for electronic transmission of data to the AGT in an automatic manner of information related to production.
The counting and measurement systems referred to above must be certified by the AGT, under the terms to be regulated.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is payable on a wide variety of transactions and documents, at specific amounts or at a percentage based on value.
If not liable to VAT, the following transactions/documents are subject to stamp tax:
| Transactions liable to stamp tax | Stamp tax rates |
| --- | --- |
| On receipts: |  |
| Stamp tax on receipts. (1) | 1% |
| Financing operations: |  |
| Use of credit in general at rates depending on the period. | Period less than or equal to one year: 0.5% |
| Period greater than one year: 0.4% |
| Period greater than or equal to five years: 0.3% |
| Period not determined (e.g. current account), per month by the monthly average of the debt: 0.1% |
| Real estate operations: |  |
| Acquisition for consideration of property. | 0.3% |
| Letting and subletting, as well as financial leasing of real estate, except when the leasing is for a permanent dwelling, which is exempt from stamp tax. | Commercial purposes: 0.4% |
| Residential purposes: 0.1% |
| Corporate acts: |  |
| Initial or increase of share capital, whether made in cash or in kind. | 0.1% |
| Insurance: |  |
| Insurance is generally subject to stamp tax although some exemptions may apply. | The stamp tax applies on the amount of premium paid, and rates may vary from 0.1% to 0.3%, depending on the policy’s nature. |
| Commissions for mediation are subject to stamp tax at a rate of 0.4%. |
| Other operations: |  |
| Written agreements, checks, lending, civil deposits, gambling, licences, deeds, credit bonds, and transfer of business, among other acts. | Rates vary depending on the nature of the transaction. |
Notes
1. Taxable persons covered by the standard or simplified VAT regimes are exempt from the 1% stamp tax on receipts, except for:
## Property tax
Property tax is levied on the taxable property value of urban and rural property owned, rental income derived from such real estate, and income derived from the sale or transfer of immovable property.
### Leased assets
Property tax is levied on rental income at a 25% nominal rate. However, the tax basis is only 60% of the rental income, as it is presumed that 40% relates to costs. Consequently, the effective property tax rate for rental income is 15%.
The taxation of income from rented properties may not be lower than that which would result from taxing the ownership of the same immovable property if it was not generating rental income.
### Assets that are not leased
Property tax is levied as follows for the ownership of assets that are not leased:
| Patrimonial value (AOA) | Property tax |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 5 million | 0.1% |
| From 5,000,001 to 6 million | AOA 5,000 (fixed value) |
| Over 6 million (on the excess of 5 million) (1) | 0.5% |
Notes
1. For example, an asset registered at AOA 35 million will pay property tax only on AOA 30 million, resulting in property tax payable of AOA 150,000.
Buildings and land for construction that are not effectively being used are subject to aggravated taxation, subject to certain conditions.
### Transfer of properties
The property tax rate levied on the transfer of immovable property is 2%.
### Exemptions
The following entities are exempt from property tax (among others):
### Payment
Rents paid by Angolan companies or individuals that carry out a commercial activity are subject to withholding tax (WHT) of 15%. The property tax withheld must be paid to the tax authorities by the end of the following month.
For property not leased, the respective owners must pay the property tax until March of the following year. The payment in six instalments is possible if approved by the tax authorities.
For property tax on the transfer of immovable property, the acquiring party must pay the tax to the tax authorities until the last working day of the month following the transaction/transfer.
### Filing requirements
Property Tax Model 1 must be filed by the taxpayers each January, disclosing the rents effectively collected in the previous year and the leasing agreements duly stamped.
## Special Levy on Foreign Exchange Operations (*Contribuição Especial sobre Operações Cambiais* or CEOC)
CEOC is due on transfers related to agreements for the rendering of services, technical assistance, consulting and management, capital operations, and unilateral transactions.
Payments related to health and education expenses are excluded from CEOC as long as they are performed directly to the bank accounts of health and education institutions (conditions apply). Transfers of dividends, reimbursement of borrowed capital, and associated interest are equally excluded from CEOC.
The applicable rate is 10% for corporate entities and 2.5% for individuals. It applies to the value of the transferred funds.
Exemptions apply to (i) the state and any of its bodies, establishments, and organisations, except public institutes and companies, and (ii) diamond companies and oil companies.
Financial institutions shall guarantee the assessment and settlement of the CEOC; otherwise, they will incur fines in an amount corresponding to the levy.
## Payroll taxes
### Personal income tax (PIT)
Resident and non-resident individuals earning income from services directly or indirectly provided to individuals or corporate entities in Angola are subject to monthly taxation (PIT) at rates progressing from 0% to 25%. Angola operates a fairly straightforward pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, in which the Angolan employer withholds monthly from each employee's gross compensation the Angolan income tax.
Individuals only deriving employment income are not required to file tax returns, as the PIT is withheld at source by their employer.
The General State Budget (GSB) for the year 2024 amended the PIT Code and established that the taxable income of Group C taxpayers whose turnover, in the financial year 2023, is equal to or less than AOA 10 million, corresponding to the volume of sales of goods and services not subject to WHT, on which the rate of 6.5% will apply.
Regardless of the volume of invoicing, taxpayers in this group who have organised accounting must follow the rules applicable to the calculation of the taxable income of taxpayers under the CIT regime, with the relevant adjustments.
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on the gross income of employees at rates of 3% for the employee (8% in case of retired employees) and 8% for the employer.
The contributions are intended to cover family, pension, and unemployment protection.

# Angola
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year follows the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The annual CIT return for companies under the general and simplified regime must be submitted by the last business day of May and April, respectively, following the year to which the income relates.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers under the general regime that record sales and services excluded from WHT are required to make advance CIT payments by the end of August.
This tax is calculated by applying the rate of 2% to the total amount of sales and services excluded from the application of CIT WHT recorded by the taxpayers in the first half of the tax year. Advance payments may be offset against final CIT assessed.
The taxpayers may assess the 2% provisional payments of CIT due on sales based on the actual amounts received (rather than the turnover), but, in such cases, they are required to deliver the bank statements to the tax authorities.
Taxpayers with tax losses in the previous year may be exempt from the 2% provisional payments of CIT on sales.
The taxpayers that replace their suppliers in the issuance of invoices (considering the self-invoicing regime defined in law) should, at the moment of payment to the supplier for the provision of goods, withhold 2%.
The final tax must be settled by the last business day of the month of April (simplified regime) and May (general regime) of the following year.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities may carry out tax audits to the monthly and annual tax returns.
Taxpayers may challenge any decision and file an appeal to the Chief of the respective Tax Office within 30 days upon receiving the tax notification.
Based on an unsatisfactory decision of the Chief of the Tax Office, the taxpayer may also file a hierarchical appeal addressed to the President of the Tax Authorities Executive Board (AGT) within 30 days upon receiving the tax notification.
The taxpayer still has the right to appeal against the final decision of the AGT in court within 60 days upon receiving the final decision from the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Angola is generally five years but may be extended to ten years in case of a tax crime. It is also ten years when relating to property tax on the transfer of real estate.
The tax authorities' main areas of focus are related to:
## Legal regime on invoices and equivalent documents
Invoices or similar documents must comply with the legal regime of invoices and similar documents (governed by the Presidential Decree 292/18).
Invoices and similar documents must comply with the following requirements (amongst others):
The legal regime of invoices and similar documents also established the following rules:
Suppliers that do not comply with this regime are subject to fines and penalties. In addition, the acquiring entities cannot deduct the cost for CIT purposes and will be subject to an autonomous taxation on an amount that varies depending on the extent of the failure.
Additionally, from a VAT perspective, the VAT assessed in invoices that does not comply with that foreseen in the Law is not deductible.
## Legal regime for self-billing
Presidential Decree No. 144/23, of 29 June 2023, approved the new legal regime for self-billing.
The main changes reflect the legislator's will to encourage the use of the self-invoicing mechanism, making the regime simpler and more comprehensive.
This regime updates the following rules:
## Legal framework on electronic processing and recording of tax procedures
Presidential Decree no. 95/23, of 6 April 2023, approved the new Legal Framework on the Electronic Communication and Processing of Tax Procedures and Tax Execution Procedure.
This regime sets out new rules applicable to notifications and other communications of tax procedures by electronic means.
This regime mainly updates the following rules:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
The Personal Income Tax (PIT) Code foresees, with the respective specificities, the segmentation of income into Groups, namely:
## Personal income tax rates
Group B and Group C taxpayers are subject to PIT in line with the regime provided for business and professional income.
The PIT Code provides the following two regimes of taxation of income derived by Group B taxpayers, and the withholding tax (WHT) rules depend on the payer's status:
1. When the income is paid by companies, or individuals who have a simplified accounting or a general accounting model/organised accounting, the taxable amount corresponds to the value of the service and is subject to WHT at a rate of 6.5%.
2. When the income is paid by entities that do not meet the requirements mentioned in 1 above, the taxable income is determined by the service provided based on one's accounting records, the available records of purchases, sales, and services rendered, or the data available by the tax authorities according to the specific rules applicable to taxpayers of Group B and is subject to a 25% tax rate. Taxpayers maintaining accounting books and records, simplified accounting model, or purchase and sale or services provided registration book are allowed to deduct up to 30% of incurred expenses in the computation of taxable income. Taxpayers of Group B with no organised nor simplified accounting models are not entitled to deduct costs, and the tax is levied over all income.
For Group C taxpayers with organised accounting, the taxable income (not subject to WHT) should be determined, with the necessary adjustments, in similar terms as the ones applicable to taxpayers subject to the general corporate income tax (CIT) regime. Group C taxpayers without organised accounting may determine the taxable income (not subject to WHT) according to deemed profits (table of minimum profits) or, when exceeding certain limits, the turnover (sales of goods and services rendered).
| Taxable income | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| The amount of profits not subject to WHT assessed through the accounting records of individuals with organised accounting (Groups B and C) is subject to the following rate.The amount of profits established in the minimum profits table (Group C) or amount of sales of goods and services not subject to WHT, when the taxpayer has turnover in excess of four times the maximum value established in the minimum profits table, is subject to the following rate. | 25 |
| Fees paid to self-employed individuals are subject to the following WHT when the payer has organised or simplified accounting models. | 6.5 |
| Business and professional income derived by non-resident professionals is generally subject to final WHT of 6.5% on the gross amount. | 6.5 |
| The taxable income of Group C taxpayers whose turnover, in the financial year 2023, is equal to or less than 10 million Angolan kwanza (AOA), corresponding to the volume of sales of goods and services not subject to WHT, on which the rate of 6.5% will apply. | 6.5 |
For Group A, there are progressive income tax rates up to 25%, as follows:
| Income (AOA) | Payable tax (AOA) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 100,000 | Exempt |
| Between 100,001 and 150,000 | 13% upon the excess of 100,001 |
| Between 150,001 and 200,000 | 12,500 + 16% upon the excess of 150,001 |
| Between 200,001 and 300,000 | 31,250 + 18% upon the excess of 200,001 |
| Between 300,001 and 500,000 | 49,250 + 19% upon the excess of 300,001 |
| Between 500,001 and 1,000,000 | 87,250 + 20% upon the excess of 500,001 |
| Between 1,000,001 and 1,500,000 | 187,249 + 21% upon the excess of 1,000,001 |
| Between 1,500,001 and 2,000,000 | 292,249 + 22% upon the excess of 1,500,001 |
| Between 2,000,001 and 2,500,000 | 402,249 + 23% upon the excess of 2,000,001 |
| Between 2,500,001 and 5,000,000 | 517,249 + 24% upon the excess of 2,500,001 |
| Between 5,000,001 and 10,000,000 | 1,117,249 + 24.5% upon the excess of 5,000,001 |
| More than 10,000,001 | 2,342,248 + 25% upon the excess of 10,000,001 |
## Investment Income Tax (IIT)

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Individuals only deriving employment income are not required to file tax returns, as the PIT is withheld at source by their employer.
PIT is assessed and paid on a pay as you earn (PAYE) basis through monthly WHT collected by employers.
Self-employed workers file an annual return disclosing their annual income during March of the following year.
By the end of February each year, employers should file the PIT annual return ('Modelo 2'). This return should disclose the number of employees and self-employed individuals to which the entity made payments, the total amount of wages and other income paid to each individual, and the total amount of PIT withheld, with all information referring to the previous year.
## Payment of tax
PIT is paid on a PAYE basis through monthly WHT collected by employers.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
WHT is applicable on payments of services (some exemptions apply) at the rate of 6.5%.
For Angolan taxpayers, the tax is regarded as an advanced payment of the CIT due at the year-end; the deduction of these WHTs against CIT payable is subject to acceptance by the Angola tax authorities. For non-resident companies, this is a final tax.

# Angola
## Overview
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Angola, officially the Republic of Angola, is a country in South-Central Africa bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Angola is made up of 18 provinces, with Luanda as its capital. Portuguese is the official language of Angola, and the official currency is the kwanza (AOA).
Angola is run by a multiparty regime, with its President as the chief of state. Its legal system is based on Portuguese civil law and customary law, modified to accommodate political pluralism and increased use of free markets.
Angola’s climate characteristics, the quality and richness of its soils, its young and growing population, and its high potential for diversification and growth of the economy that is not dependent on oil position it as one of the main countries in Africa and the world in which to invest. Angola is country that can, in fact, respond to some of the global difficulties the world is going through, with the potential to become a leader in some products and sectors of activity.
Since 2018, under President João Lourenço, Angola has been actively pursuing economic reforms aimed at diversifying its economy and reducing dependence on oil. Key initiatives include selling state stakes in various companies to attract foreign investment and boost economic efficiency (privatisations), efforts to simplify bureaucracy and enhance transparency, including adherence to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and promotion of sectors such as agriculture, mining, and tourism through infrastructure investments and fiscal incentives.
Despite an international climate of high prices for raw materials and food products, Angola has shown signs of economic recovery in 2023 and 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, Angola recorded a 4.1% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the same period in 2023, mainly driven by activities such as agriculture (4.0%), oil extraction and refining (4.6%), electricity and water (8.7%), trade (4.9%), transport and storage (15.0%), and the extraction of diamonds and metallic minerals (33.3%). Foreign direct investment (FDI) also saw an increase in investment in sectors such as agriculture, mining, and telecommunications, contributing to economic diversification. Fiscal stability has also helped the Angolan economy to overcome challenges. Improvements in inflation control, tax reforms, and the reduction of public debt reinforced macroeconomic stability.
The conduct of Angola's monetary policy in 2024 has taken place in a challenging macroeconomic context, with irregularities in the supply of goods, the gradual removal of fuel subsidies, price adjustments in communication, transportation, and education, as well as the ongoing rise in healthcare costs, leading to the estimate that inflation at the end of the year will be around 27%.
Angola is the second-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa. As of 2024, Angola’s oil production averages approximately 1.1 to 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd). This represents a decline from peak levels of over 1.8 million bpd in the late 2000s, attributed to maturing fields and underinvestment in new projects. Oil production plays a crucial economic role in Angola, contributing significantly to national revenues. The volume of crude oil exported in the third quarter of 2024 amounted to approximately 777.82 million United States dollars (USD), resulting in an increase of 5.42% compared to the second quarter of the current year and a 2.01% increase compared to the same quarter in 2023. The natural gas exports during this period also recorded a rise of 24.28% compared to the previous quarter. Similar to the previous quarter, China was the main destination for exports, accounting for 46.22%, followed by Indonesia with 6.74%, India with 6.60%, Brazil with 5.67%, Spain with 4.87%, and France with 4.71%. Liquified natural gas (LNG) was primarily exported to India, representing about 74.8% of the product. The sector is also vital for government revenue, despite ongoing efforts to diversify the economy. Additionally, oil production is fundamental for employment and local content development. Although direct employment in the oil sector is limited, there is increasing emphasis on local content policies to boost Angolan participation and employment in the industry.
However, the oil sector presents several challenges and opportunities. Many of Angola’s key oil fields are reaching maturity, leading to natural production declines. This necessitates enhanced recovery techniques and increased investment in new field development and exploration. Also, the ageing infrastructure and the need for maintenance and upgrades pose challenges to sustaining and increasing production levels.
In 2023, Angola made the announcement that it was leaving the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effective 1 January 2024, severing a 16-year-long relationship. When the African oil exporter joined the producers’ group in 2007, it was the first country to do so since 1975. The relationship between Angola and OPEC changed drastically over that period.
Angola’s oil production continues to play a pivotal role in the country’s economy, but challenges such as maturing fields and the need for diversification present ongoing issues. With strategic investments and reforms, Angola aims to stabilise and potentially increase its oil production while fostering broader economic development. The focus on local content and sustainable practices is expected to shape the future of Angola’s oil industry.
Angola is the fourth largest producer of diamonds in the world and the second in Africa. Angolan diamonds are mainly mined in the province of Lunda Norte and represent about 20% of the world’s diamond production. The global demand for diamonds is increasing, especially in China and Japan. China is currently the largest market for Angolan diamonds. Angola’s diamond industry is well positioned to benefit from these growing markets. Looking ahead, Angola's mining sector will continue to be dominated by diamond exploration and production, which accounts for around 90% of total mining revenues.
With demand for strategic minerals, non-ferrous metals, and rare earths increasing dramatically due to the global energy transition and the use of strategic minerals in lithium-ion batteries, the sector is expected to significantly increase its contribution to the country's GDP growth. Angola is ambitiously aiming to boost its diamond output by 50% in 2024, targeting 14.6 million carats, up from 9.7 million in 2023. This surge is expected to generate USD 2.5 billion, significantly up from USD 1.51 billion in 2023. The Luele mine is central to these aspirations, potentially producing 20 million carats annually. Despite current market challenges, the proactive strategies and the rich potential of new mining projects offer a glimmer of hope for Angola’s diamond sector.
These efforts are not only crucial for the country’s economic health but also for maintaining its stature in the global diamond industry.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation should be computed using the straight-line method; any other method must be approved by the tax authorities.
The tax depreciation rates should respect the limits imposed by Presidential Decree No. 207/15, of 5 November 2015, and Decree No. 755/72, of 26 October 1972, altered by Decree No. 57/74, of 24 January 1974.
The table below summarises some examples of the depreciation tax rates.
| Type of asset | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Office buildings | 4 |
| Industrial buildings | 4 |
| Computers | 33.33 |
| Furniture | Between 12.5 and 25 |
| Software | 20 |
| Light passenger vehicles | 25 |
An intensive operating regime is foreseen allowing accelerated depreciation. The depreciation rate can be increased by 25% in the case of production on two shifts and by 50% in the case of continuous production.
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest costs are generally deductible for CIT purposes. Interest arising from shareholder loans may be deductible for tax purposes up to the limit that would result from the annual average interest rate established by the Angolan Central Bank.
## Bad debt
## Provisions
The following provisions are accepted as tax deductible:
In relation to doubtful debts, the regime:
In relation to the losses incurred with inventories, the regime:
## Charitable contributions
Donations are only deductible for CIT purposes if fully compliant with the Patronage Law. The requirements imposed by this law are very restrictive.
The donations granted outside the scope of Patronage Law are also subject to autonomous taxation at a rate of 15%.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible costs for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Certain taxes are non-deductible for CIT purposes, namely the CIT itself, PIT, IIT, property tax, or taxes paid on behalf of third parties (e.g. PIT borne on behalf of the employees).
## Autonomous taxation
Confidential expenses are subject to autonomous taxation at rates of 30% and 50%. The donations granted outside the scope of Patronage Law are also subject to autonomous taxation at a rate of 15%.
The amount of autonomous taxation should be added to the taxable income in the case of donations and added to the tax due in the case of confidential expenses.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for five years.
Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are accepted for tax purposes, although the arm’s-length principle should be complied with.

# Angola
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Major taxpayers that are members of an economic group may opt to be taxed under the tax regime of group taxation.
The option for the group taxation regime is available when:
Some limitations apply, and the option to apply group taxation depends on the approval of the tax authorities.
## Transfer pricing
In October 2013, Angola enacted specific transfer pricing legislation through the Presidential Decree 147/13. Although published on 1 October 2013, the provisions of the decree became applicable to tax years starting on or after 1 January 2014. This legislation imposes rather demanding obligations on taxpayers.
According to Angola’s transfer pricing requirements, all taxpayers (not just large taxpayers, as per Law 26/20 of 20 July 2020), whose annual turnover exceeds AOA 7 billion at the end of the fiscal year must prepare and submit a transfer pricing documentation file within six months of the fiscal year's end.
Furthermore, in 2020, the National Bank of Angola issued a Circular Letter 002/DCC/2020 that provides guidelines for banking financial institutions regarding validating payments under service contracts with non-resident entities. It mandates that such contracts demonstrate arm's-length pricing through either transfer pricing documentation (for large taxpayers) or benchmarking studies (for other taxpayers).
Finally, while Angola is not an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member state, its transfer pricing rules align with the recommendations of the UN Transfer Pricing Manual.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest arising from shareholder loans should be deductible for tax purposes up to the limit that would result from the annual average interest rate established by the Angolan Central Bank.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Angola.

Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign tax credits are generally not available to offset against domestic tax.
Foreign tax credits may be granted according to the provisions of double tax treaties (DTTs).
## Tax Benefits Code (TBC)
The main benefits foreseen under the recently approved TBC encompass the following:
### Profits or dividends from securities traded in a regulated market
### Job creation, internships, and professional training
#### Job creation
#### Internships and professional training
### Environment
### Financial system and capital markets

Tax benefits are granted to income from:
### Private investment
The tax benefits available for the purposes of CIT, IIT, property tax, and stamp tax granted under the Private Investment Regime are established as applicable to (i) the contractual regime, (ii) the special regime, and (iii) the prior declaration regime. The areas covered are also detailed (*see below*).
### Free Zones
Several benefits are granted to companies operating in the Free Zones of Angola, for the purposes of CIT, IIT, property tax, and customs duties.
### Capitalisation of companies
Companies are allowed to deduct from the taxable income an amount corresponding to a conventional remuneration of the share capital. Prior approval is required, and caps apply.
### Restructuring of companies
Under restructuring operations, companies in Angola can request an exemption or reduction from property tax on the transfer of real estate that is not for residential use.
### Other tax benefits
Other tax benefits are foreseen for:
We highlight the following:
## Private Investment Law
The implementation of investment projects in Angola may benefit from tax incentives regarding CIT, property tax, IIT, and stamp tax.
The Private Investment Law establishes that the tax incentives may be granted according to the following three regimes: (i) contractual regime, (ii) special regime or (iii) prior declaration regime.
### Contractual regime
The contractual regime applies to investments with a minimum amount of 10 million United States dollars (USD) and that create 50 direct jobs for nationals or, regardless of the amount, if they correspond to the structuring areas foreseen in the regulation of the private investment law, allowing the investors to negotiate the tax incentives for the project within the following frame and limitations:
### Special regime
The special regime applies to private investments with an amount below that foreseen for the contractual regime and entailing the performance of the activities specifically listed in the Regulation of the Private Investment Law, which are all in the priority sectors (education, agriculture, health, tourism, telecommunications, energy, amongst others). In this regime, the tax benefits are granted automatically and vary according to the zone where the investment is made (Zone A, B, C, and D).
### Prior declaration regime
The prior declaration regime applies to investments not covered by any of the regimes previously referred, being the following tax benefits also granted automatically:
In addition to the above listed benefits, entities may also benefit from other facilities, such as applications for permits, work visas, energy, water supplies, and others.
## Reinvestment of reserves
Profits retained and then reinvested in new installations or equipment during the following three financial years may be deductible from taxable income during the following five years after the investment is finalised, at up to 80% of the value reinvested depending on the location of the investment performed.

The publication of Presidential Decree n.º 33/20 introduced the obligation of reporting financial institutions to implement a compliance program within one year after the entry into force of this decree, which includes procedures and processes adequate for effective compliance obligations under the FATCA regime.
Based on the terms of Order no. 1169/20, after the implementation of the compliance program, the reporting financial institutions will have to certify, before the AGT, their compliance with the FATCA regime.
The reporting of financial information for the purposes of FATCA must be provided by the financial institutions to the AGT through the submission of the FATCA file via the Taxpayer Portal by 30 June of each year, with reference to the previous year.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Tax treaties
Angola has signed Double Tax Treaties (DTTs) with Portugal, the United Arab Emirates, and the People's Republic of China, which are currently in force.
Angola has also signed DTTs with some other countries, such as Cabo Verde, Mauritius, Rwanda, and Switzerland, but they are not yet in force.
There are prior compliance procedures that must be met before applying the DTT benefits.
