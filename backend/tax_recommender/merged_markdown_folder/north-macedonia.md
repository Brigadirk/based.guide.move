# North Macedonia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable period for which CIT is determined covers one calendar year.
## Tax returns
Taxpayers are obligated to calculate and pay CIT on the basis of a CIT return, which must be submitted to the Public Revenue Office by the end of February of the following year or, if filed electronically, by 15 March of the following year.
Taxpayers who distribute profit arising from FY 2009 to FY 2013 are obligated to calculate and pay CIT on the basis of a tax return on profit distribution, which should be submitted to the tax authorities up to the date of profit distribution.
Taxpayers that have used the incentive for reinvested profit in previous years should submit a specific tax return to the tax authorities and pay the due CIT within 30 days as of the date taxpayers no longer satisfied the conditions for using such incentive.
Taxpayers should submit a specific tax return and pay the CIT due at the moment of transfer of revaluation reserves of tangible and intangible assets into accumulated profit. Only the transfer of revaluation reserves recognised prior to 2019 is taxable.
Small taxpayers who fall under the simplified tax regime are obligated to calculate and pay the tax due on the basis of a tax return on overall income, which should be submitted to the tax authorities by the end of February of the following year or, if filed electronically, by 15 March of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Corporate taxpayers are obligated to pay monthly CIT advance payments during the year within 15 days of the end of each month.
Monthly CIT advance payments are calculated as one-twelfth of the CIT obligation for the previous calendar year, increased by the index of cumulative retail price growth as determined by the State Statistical Bureau.
The difference between the advance payments and the final CIT liability as determined in the CIT return should be paid within 30 days as of the deadline for submission of the CIT return. Daily penalty interest of 0.03% is due on late tax payments.
In case the sum of monthly advance payments exceeds the final tax liability in the CIT return, the taxpayer may request for a refund of overpaid tax. The tax should be refunded within 60 days as of the date of submitting the request via the CIT return. If the taxpayer does not ask for a tax refund, the overpaid amounts will be considered as advance payment for the following period.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit may include one or more taxes, one or more fiscal periods, or only certain tax issues. The extent of the tax audit is determined solely by the tax authorities and is based on their estimation of risk in respect of the specific taxpayer. VAT audits are commonly conducted when VAT refund is requested by the taxpayer, and, in this case, the tax audit is usually limited in the area of VAT. The advance notice for tax audit for large taxpayers and concerns is four weeks, whereas the advance notice for all other taxpayers is two weeks. In cases where the tax authorities find that it would be an obstacle for the tax audit, an advanced notice will not be given to the taxpayer.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years as of the end of the calendar year in which the tax event occurred. In case of tax evasion, the statute of limitations is ten years as of the end of the calendar year in which the tax event occurred.

# North Macedonia
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The basis for the mandatory social security contributions calculation is the salary and the additional remuneration from employment (including bonuses) as determined in the labour legislation.
The law also sets the minimal base for payment of social security contributions on salary and bonuses, which on a monthly basis is 50% of the average salary paid in North Macedonia.
The highest base for payment of mandatory social security contributions on a monthly basis is 16 average salaries paid in North Macedonia. No social contributions are due on the difference above this threshold.
Calculation and payment of all the employees’ social contributions is regulated under the Law on Mandatory Social Insurance Contributions.
Employers are obligated to calculate, withhold from employees’ gross salary, and pay into the accounts of respective funds the compulsory social contributions and personal income tax (PIT). The current level of the compulsory social contributions on gross salary is as follows:
The Public Revenue Office (PRO) is the authorised body to control the calculation and the payment of compulsory social contributions and PIT on salaries. All employers send their calculations to the PRO that controls them and, if correct, issues a declaration of acceptance that is afterwards presented to the respective depository bank, in order to perform the payment of mandatory social security contributions, PIT, and net salaries.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 18%. This rate applies to overall turnover and imports of goods and services. In addition to the standard VAT of 18%, preferential rates of 5% and 10% are applied for turnover of certain goods and services.
## Inheritance and gift tax
Inheritance and gift tax is paid on real estate and entitlements to usage of real estate, which the heirs or the receivers of gifts, respectively, inherit/receive on the basis of an inheritance/gift agreement. Tax is also paid for cash, money claims, securities, and other movable property, provided the value of the inheritance/gift is higher than the average annual salary in North Macedonia as determined by the State Statistical Bureau for the previous year. The values of all gifts of the same type, received in the course of one calendar year, are included in one tax base. The municipal administration keeps records on the value of the gifts, on the basis of which, at the end of the year, the tax can be determined for the person receiving the gift, should one receive more gifts of the same type that cumulatively surpass the non-taxable amount in the course of the year.
The inheritance and gift tax base is the market value of the property inherited or received as a gift as at the moment the tax liability arises, decreased by the debts and expenses burdening such property.
Property tax rates are proportional and differ on the basis of the order of succession. They are prescribed within a certain range and depend on the decision of the relevant municipality.
The heir or receiver of the gift in first order of succession is exempt from paying inheritance and gift tax. The taxpayer in the second order of succession is subject to a tax rate between 2% and 3%. As for the taxpayer in third order of succession or a taxpayer who is not related to the testator, 4% to 5% tax rate is levied.

# North Macedonia
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
In general, the VAT regulations are in line with the provisions of the sixth European Union (EU) VAT directive.
The standard VAT rate is 18%. This rate applies to overall turnover and imports of goods and services. In addition to the standard VAT of 18%, preferential rates of 5% and 10% are applied for turnover of certain goods and services.
The preferential tax rate of 10% applies to restaurant services and catering services, with the exception of alcoholic beverages, as well as for certain food products that are not deemed as basic products for human consumption.
All taxpayers whose total annual turnover exceeds MKD 2 million or whose total supplies, as projected at the beginning of the business activity, will exceed this amount are liable to register for VAT purposes.
Residents that do not meet the criteria above may voluntarily register for VAT purposes at the beginning of each calendar year.
The standard VAT period is one calendar month. However, if the total turnover in the previous calendar year did not exceed MKD 25 million, the tax period is the calendar quarter. The VAT period for voluntary VAT registered taxpayers is the calendar quarter.
The taxpayer is obligated to submit a VAT return for each tax period within 25 days following the end of the relevant tax period. VAT is payable within 30 days following the end of the relevant tax period.
## Customs duties
Customs duties generally apply to most products imported into North Macedonia. The customs rates under the most favoured nation treatment for agricultural products are up to 31%, whereas the customs rates for industrial products are below 23%.
North Macedonia has signed trade agreements with Turkey, Ukraine, and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states. The country is a member state to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Community.
The import of industrial products with preferential origin and certain raw precious metals is exempt from customs duties.
According to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement 2001 signed between Macedonia and the European Union, products with Macedonian origin can generally be exported into EU countries free of customs duties.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are levied with respect to a limited number of goods produced or imported in North Macedonia. Alcohol and alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and fuels and electricity are subject to an excise duty at a flat or percentage rate. The excise period is one calendar month, and excise duty is payable within 15 days as of the end of the calendar month. The excise duty for alcohol beverages and tobacco goods is levied by way of purchasing excise stamps.
Alcohol and alcoholic beverages are taxable per litre/percentage of alcohol. Some categories of alcoholic beverages (e.g. wine) are not subject to excise duty. Maximum excise duty payable is up to MKD 340 per litre on pure alcohol.
The excise duty for tobacco products is combined and is calculated both per unit/kilo and as a percentage from the retail price. As of 1 January 2024 up to 1 January 2030, the rate of the specific and minimum excise duty on cigars/smoking tobacco will increase by MKD 0.23 per peace every year.
The excise duty for fuels and electricity is paid in cases where those are used as a fuel or heating fuel. The excise base for fuels is the amount of fuels expressed in kilo net mass, normal cubic meters, litre, or giga joules gross calorific value, except for electricity where the excise base is the amount expressed in megawatt hours.
## Property tax
Property tax is paid annually on the ownership of real estate, including land (agricultural, construction, forest, and pastures) and buildings (residential buildings or flats, business buildings and business premises, administrative buildings and administrative premises, buildings and flats for rest and recreation, and other construction facilities, as well as installations constructed on the buildings or below and permanently attached to the buildings).
The person liable for property tax is the legal entity or the individual owner of the property. If the owner is not known or cannot be reached, the person liable for property tax is the user of the property. A property taxpayer may also be the taxpayer who usufructs the property; and, if the property is owned by several persons, each of them is a property taxpayer proportionately for the portion owned. A property taxpayer is also the person who uses real estate owned by the state and the municipality.
The property tax base is the market value of the real estate. The market value of the real estate is determined in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the government.
Property tax rates are proportional and range from 0.10% to 0.20%. The rates may be determined on the basis of the type of the property. As an exception, property tax rates on agricultural land not used for agricultural production and residential or commercial real estate that is not used or not leased for more than six months during a calendar year may be increased outside the above range (i.e. from three to five times in relation to the basic rates).
The amount of the rates is decided by the Municipal Councils.
## Transfer tax
The transfer of the right to ownership of real estate for or without compensation, as well as other means of acquiring real estate for or without compensation, between legal entities or natural persons is subject to transfer tax.
The person liable for transfer tax is the seller of the real estate. As an exception, a taxpayer may also be the buyer of the real estate if agreed in the sale and purchase agreement. When replacing real estate, the taxpayer is the party that replaces the real estate of greater value.
When selling real estate in bankruptcy and law-enforcement procedure, as well as when realising agreements on mortgage, the taxpayer may be the buyer of the real estate.
In the case of transfer of ownership of an ideal share in real estate, taxpayers are each of the owners separately.
The tax base is the market value of the real estate at the moment the tax liability arises.
When replacing real estate, the tax base is the difference between the market values of the real estate being replaced.
When selling real estate in bankruptcy and law-enforcement procedure, the tax base is the attained selling price.
The market value is determined by a special municipal commission in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the government.
Tax rates are proportional and range from 2% to 4%. The tax rates are determined by the municipal councils by way of decision.
There are certain exemptions from transfer taxes available for specifically determined cases (i.e. transfer of shares, sale of securities, the first sale of residential premises for the first five years from the end of their construction, etc.).
## Stamp taxes
Stamp taxes are not payable in North Macedonia.
## Social security contributions and payroll taxes
Employers are obligated to calculate and withhold from employees’ gross salary and pay into the accounts of respective funds the compulsory social security contributions and personal income tax (PIT). The current level of the compulsory social security contributions is as follows:
The legislation prescribes the minimum and the maximum base for calculation of the social security contributions.
The Public Revenue Office (PRO) is the authorised body to control the calculation and the payment of the compulsory social security contributions and PIT on salaries. All employers send their calculations to the PRO that controls them and, if correct, issues a declaration of acceptance that is used by the banks to perform the payment of the social security contribution, PIT, and net salaries.
## Garbage collection fee
A garbage collection fee is payable for immovable property, depending on the type of property and on the surface area used. It is calculated on the basis of a tariff and is collected together with the bills for water usage.
## Communal taxes
Companies and individuals are liable for paying communal taxes for usage of certain rights and services (mainly for usage of the urban space in the municipalities, posting commercials, etc.).
## Motor vehicle tax
From 1 January 2020, a new tax on motor vehicles is introduced, which basically taxes passenger cars and other motor vehicles designed primarily for transport of persons, including motorcycles and pickup vehicles, as well as vans for combined transport of persons and goods.
The subject of taxation is new and used motor vehicles that are imported and/or put into free circulation in the country for the first time. This law does not cover freight motor vehicles and exclusively electrically driven vehicles.
The tax base for motor vehicle tax calculation is the amount of average carbon dioxide (CO2) expressed in grams per kilometre, depending on the type of propulsion fuel and the sales value of the vehicle or import value of the vehicle if the vehicle is imported.
Motor Vehicle Tax = Value + Specific Component
Where:
Value = The value of the motor vehicle multiplied by the percentage of the value of the vehicle for the appropriate value category.
Specific component = The amount of average CO2 emissions multiplied by the value of 1 gram of CO2 for a given category, depending on the fuel type of the vehicle.
There are specific rules for:
The competent authority for determining, collecting, and controlling the implementation of the Law on Motor Vehicles is the Customs Administration of the Republic of North Macedonia.

# North Macedonia
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
As per the new PIT Law, taxpayers are no longer required to prepare and file the annual tax return (form PDD-GDP). Instead, the PRO undertook the obligation to prepare the annual tax return based on the electronic fillings made during the year by the companies and the taxpayers *elaborated in description of Payment of tax below*. The PRO would deliver to each taxpayer the draft annual tax return for the calendar year by 30 April of the following year. Within the next month (until 31 May), the taxpayer should confirm the correctness of the data included in the draft return or make appropriate corrections. If the taxpayer neither confirms nor corrects the prepared return by the PRO, the draft tax return would be deemed as final. In case the PRO cannot confirm the corrected annual tax return by the taxpayer, the tax would be determined by way of a Tax Assessment Form issued by the tax authorities.
Individuals who realise business income and keep accounting records submit annual accounts and annual tax return by 15 March of the following year for the previous calendar year.
## Payment of tax
Under the new PIT Law, all taxable income should be reported and PIT paid in advance. Before payment of any taxable income to individuals, taxpayers that are domestic companies and domestic taxpayers that keep accounting records are obligated to calculate, withhold, and pay PIT on behalf of the individuals. These taxpayers should electronically file a calculation for the income payable to the individual and the PIT due to the PRO for approval. The PRO confirms the calculation, following which the payment of income and PIT could be made at the banks.
In all other cases, the taxpayer is obligated to report taxable income and pay PIT in advance on a monthly basis. This obligation would apply for the taxable income realised abroad as well, except for salaries. Namely, by the 10th day of the following month for the income realised in the previous month, each taxpayer should electronically file a calculation for the income and the PIT due to the PRO for approval. Following the approval by the PRO, the PIT should be paid by the 15th day of the following month for the income realised in the previous month. Evidence related to the realised income should be filed to the PRO simultaneously. The electronic reporting of the salary received from abroad should be filed by 31 March of the following year.
In case the calculation filed electronically by the taxpayer is not approved, or the corrected tax return is not accepted, the tax authorities would issue a Tax Assessment Form. In this case, the tax should be paid within 15 days as of the delivery of the Tax Assessment Form to the taxpayer.
Individuals who realise business income and keep accounting records make monthly advance payment of tax in the amount of one twelfth of the calculated tax in the annual tax return for the previous year. The difference between the final tax liability based on the annual tax return and the tax paid in advance for the calendar year is settled by 30 June.

# North Macedonia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
North Macedonia, a landlocked country located in Southeastern Europe, is bordered by Greece to the south, Bulgaria to the east, Kosovo and Serbia to the north, and Albania to the west. It gained its independence in 1991 and has a republican form of government. North Macedonia is divided into 80 municipalities, with Skopje as the capital. The official language in the country is Macedonian, and the currency is the Macedonian denar (MKD).
In the first few years after independence, the Macedonian economy suffered a plunge resulting in steep falls in gross domestic product (GDP) and the loss of a large and protected market. This led to a period of economic decline with high inflation, large fiscal deficits, and almost no foreign investment. At the end of 1994, the government initiated and successfully implemented a stabilisation program, with the assistance of international donors including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
According to the data of the State Statistical Office, the number of active business entities in the Republic of North Macedonia in 2018 was 72,315. The sectors with the highest number of business entities were wholesale and retail trade, as well as motor vehicle repair. The sectors with the least number of business entities represented were electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply, as well as mining and quarrying.
North Macedonia looks toward European Union (EU) membership for continued economic growth. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which has kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro, at the expense of raising interest rates.

# North Macedonia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
Generally, all resident and non-resident legal entities operating through a permanent establishment (PE) are liable to pay CIT in North Macedonia.
Macedonian resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident entities are taxed on the profit realised through their PE in North Macedonia.
Non-profit organisations (including non-governmental organisations, religious and humanitarian organisations, trade unions, political parties, etc.) are taxed on income from their business activities (if any) if their total annual revenues are higher than MKD 1 million. The CIT would be calculated as 1% of the total annual revenues from business activities, decreased by the prescribed tax exemption of MKD 1 million.
The CIT rate is 10%.
The tax base for CIT is the profit realised for the current year, as determined according to the applicable accounting standards, adjusted for the amount of non-deductible expenses incurred during the fiscal year.
Under the previous CIT legislation, there were two separate tax bases for CIT, which were subject to filing of two separate tax returns. In the period between FY 2009 and FY 2013, CIT was payable separately on non-deductible expenses (on an annual basis) and on financial profit (only if distributed). By means of the applicable CIT Law, the accumulated profit realised for the period FY 2009 to FY 2013 is subject to taxation at the moment of distribution or at the moment it is used to off-set accumulated losses. Taxpayers are obligated to cover the losses from previous years prior profit distribution.
CIT is not payable on received dividend income from domestic taxpayers, under condition that such income was taxed at the level of the payer.
Also, according to the new amendments in the CIT Law, 10% CIT is payable in case revaluation reserves of tangible and intangible assets are transferred into accumulated profit. The tax base is the transferred amount into accumulated profit less the amount of depreciation of the revaluated value of assets from 1 January 2019 until the date of write-off or disposal of the assets. CIT is payable by way of submitting a specific CIT return by the taxpayer.
## Simplified tax regime for companies
Companies (except companies that provide banking, financial, and insurance services, as well as services in the field of games of chance and entertainment games) can choose to benefit from the simplified tax regime based on their overall annual income. Provided other criteria prescribed in the CIT Law are met, companies will qualify for the simplified tax regime if their overall annual income from all sources is between MKD 3 million and MKD 6 million, excluding 2020 where the range is between MKD 5 million and MKD 10 million. These companies will pay 1% CIT on their overall income from all sources as stated in their income statement and financial statements for the respective calendar year.
Provided their overall annual income in the following three years is within the above range, companies under the simplified tax regime cannot request to be excluded from the simplified tax regime.
Under the simplified tax regime, exemption from CIT is available for companies with an overall annual income from all sources of up to MKD 3 million, with the exception of 2020. In 2020, companies that achieved overall annual income from all sources of up to MKD 5 million are fully exempted from paying CIT.
The exemption is not applicable for companies that perform banking, financial, and insurance activity or activity in the field of games of chance and amusement games.
## Local income taxes
There are no municipal or local government taxes levied on corporate income.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The basis for the mandatory social security contributions calculation is the salary and the additional remuneration from employment (including bonuses) as determined in the labour legislation.
The law also sets the minimal base for payment of social security contributions on salary and bonuses, which on a monthly basis is 50% of the average salary paid in North Macedonia.
The highest base for payment of mandatory social security contributions on a monthly basis is 16 average salaries paid in North Macedonia. No social contributions are due on the difference above this threshold.
Calculation and payment of all the employees’ social contributions is regulated under the Law on Mandatory Social Insurance Contributions.
Employers are obligated to calculate, withhold from employees’ gross salary, and pay into the accounts of respective funds the compulsory social contributions and personal income tax (PIT). The current level of the compulsory social contributions on gross salary is as follows:
The Public Revenue Office (PRO) is the authorised body to control the calculation and the payment of compulsory social contributions and PIT on salaries. All employers send their calculations to the PRO that controls them and, if correct, issues a declaration of acceptance that is afterwards presented to the respective depository bank, in order to perform the payment of mandatory social security contributions, PIT, and net salaries.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 18%. This rate applies to overall turnover and imports of goods and services. In addition to the standard VAT of 18%, preferential rates of 5% and 10% are applied for turnover of certain goods and services.
## Inheritance and gift tax
Inheritance and gift tax is paid on real estate and entitlements to usage of real estate, which the heirs or the receivers of gifts, respectively, inherit/receive on the basis of an inheritance/gift agreement. Tax is also paid for cash, money claims, securities, and other movable property, provided the value of the inheritance/gift is higher than the average annual salary in North Macedonia as determined by the State Statistical Bureau for the previous year. The values of all gifts of the same type, received in the course of one calendar year, are included in one tax base. The municipal administration keeps records on the value of the gifts, on the basis of which, at the end of the year, the tax can be determined for the person receiving the gift, should one receive more gifts of the same type that cumulatively surpass the non-taxable amount in the course of the year.
The inheritance and gift tax base is the market value of the property inherited or received as a gift as at the moment the tax liability arises, decreased by the debts and expenses burdening such property.
Property tax rates are proportional and differ on the basis of the order of succession. They are prescribed within a certain range and depend on the decision of the relevant municipality.
The heir or receiver of the gift in first order of succession is exempt from paying inheritance and gift tax. The taxpayer in the second order of succession is subject to a tax rate between 2% and 3%. As for the taxpayer in third order of succession or a taxpayer who is not related to the testator, 4% to 5% tax rate is levied.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
All domestic legal entities and domestic physical persons that are registered for carrying out an activity, as well as foreign legal entities or physical persons that are non-residents but have a PE in North Macedonia, are obligated to withhold tax when paying certain types of income towards a foreign legal person and to pay the tax withheld to a respective suspense account simultaneously with the payment of the income.
The WHT rate is 10% and is applied on the following forms of incomes payable abroad:

Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
Capital gains, as well as income from dividends, interest, rent, and royalties are treated as ordinary income of the taxpayer and are included in its general taxable base in accordance with accounting rules and standards. Dividend income received from domestic taxpayers is excluded from the tax base under condition that such income was taxed at the level of the payer.
## Inventory valuation
There are no provisions in the tax legislation regarding inventory valuation.

As per the local transfer pricing legislation, the taxpayer whose total annual revenue is above 300 million Macedonian denars (MKD) and the value of its transactions with non-resident related parties exceeds MKD 10 million is required to prepare a Full Transfer Pricing Report, containing a Master File and a Local File.
According to the recent amendments to the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Law, there is no longer an obligation for companies to submit the transfer pricing documentation for the calendar year by 30 September of the following year. However, the Public Revenue Office has the right to request the transfer pricing documentation no earlier than 30 days after the deadline for submitting of the financial statements and CIT return, which is 15 March. Therefore, the request from the Public Revenue Office can come on 15 April at the earliest for the transfer pricing documentation for the previous year. The taxpayer is required to submit the form within 15 days of receiving the request from the Public Revenue Office. Thus, the earliest potential deadline for submitting the transfer pricing documentation upon request of the tax authorities is 1 May of the following year.
As per the latest amendments to the Law on Value Added Tax (VAT), an obligation is introduced for a foreign person to register for VAT if such person neither has headquarters nor a subsidiary in the country and sells goods and services in the country that are subject to taxation under the VAT Law. These amendments are applicable as of 1 January 2024 onwards.
During 2023, a new Solidarity Tax was introduced, which is applicable only for the current year.
Solidarity Tax is due by the taxpayers that are liable for CIT with generated revenue greater than MKD 615 million for fiscal year (FY) 2022. The generated revenue does not include income from sale of property in bankruptcy proceedings.
The Solidarity Tax rate of 30% should be applied on the tax base determined as a difference between the:
Taxpayers are required to submit the tax return for Solidarity Tax no later than 4 October and settle the extraordinary tax until 25 October 2023.
## Implementation of Pillar Two minimum taxation rules in North Macedonia
Pillar Two legislation was enacted in North Macedonia on 27 December 2024.
The Law on Minimum Global Corporate Income Tax, is aligned with the GloBE Rules under Pillar 2 of the OECD/G20 Framework (BEPS). This law is set to be implemented retroactively for the tax period starting 1 January 2024.
MNEs should not be required to pay domestic additional tax for the fiscal year if their average qualified revenue in North Macedonia is below 10 million euros and their average qualified profit is below 1 million euros. This exemption is calculated based on data from the current and the two preceding fiscal years for all companies in the country that are part of the MNE.

## Permanent establishment (PE)
Generally, a PE is a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on, either directly or through a dependent agent.
More specifically, the domestic law provides that a PE may include a place of management, a branch office, an office, a factory, a workshop, mining activities, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.
A building site or construction or installation project, as well as related supervision activities, may constitute a PE if it lasts longer than six months.
Furthermore, the provision of services, including consulting services with regard to one or several related projects, is deemed to give rise to a PE if such activities last longer than 90 continuous days within any 12-month period. If one or several persons establish a PE as per above, any other non-related project on which they are working on becomes part of the PE, irrespective of its duration.
The PE should be registered as a corporate taxpayer at the beginning of its activity in the country for the purposes of obtaining a tax number.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
The CIT Law exhaustively lists the expenses that are not recognised for CIT purposes and are part of the CIT base.
## Hidden profit distribution
The following transactions with shareholders or their related parties are considered as hidden profit distribution subject to CIT:
Some of the transactions above may be regulated under the transfer pricing provisions in the CIT Law as well. It seems that the purpose of these provisions is to tax the non-fair transactions with shareholders and their related parties that, based on their value or related party definition, fall out of scope of the specific transfer pricing rules of the CIT Law.
## Unjustified shortages
Unjustified shortages are taxable if not reimbursed from the salary of the responsible person.
## Non-business-related expenses
Expenses that are not related to the business activity of the taxpayer are taxable.
## Depreciation
Under the CIT Law amendments applicable as of 1 January 2019, the expenses for depreciation of the re-valuated amount of tangible and intangible assets are deemed as tax non-deductible expenses.
CIT is payable in case revaluation reserves of tangible and intangible assets are transferred into accumulated profit. The tax base is the transferred amount into accumulated profit less the amount of depreciation of the revaluated value of assets from 1 January 2019 until the date of write-off or disposal of the assets.
The depreciation expenses of assets are tax deductible if calculated within the statutory-prescribed depreciation rates and rules. Taxpayers should include in the tax base the portion of depreciation that exceeds the amount calculated based on the prescribed tax rates. At the end of December 2019, the government has published the Guidelines for depreciation rates and the methodology for calculating the depreciation for tax purposes.
On the other hand, based on the recent amendments, the taxation of depreciation became a temporary difference. Taxpayers are allowed to decrease the tax base in the following year for the amount of taxed depreciation in the previous tax period.
Furthermore, the write-off of the residual value of assets that can no longer be used is tax deductible, following an approval issued by the Macedonian tax authorities. Such approval is subject to submitting a request by the taxpayer by 31 January of the following year.
## Goodwill
There are no specific provisions in the tax legislation with regard to goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
There are no specific provisions in the tax legislation with regard to start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on non-business related credits of the taxpayer, as well as interest on credits for purchase of passenger vehicles, furniture, carpets, works of art, and decorative objects, is a taxable expense. Interest on business-related credit is also taxable, provided it falls under the thin capitalisation or transfer pricing rules (*see Thin capitalisation or Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*).
## Uncollected receivables from loans
Uncollected receivables arising from loans (or transactions that are considered loans in their economic substance) that are not repaid in the year of granting are considered as taxable expenses. On the other hand, taxpayers are allowed to reduce their tax base in the tax period when such receivable is partially or fully collected. According to the recent amendments, the uncollected loan receivables from resident legal entities are not taxable.
## Impairment and write-off of receivables
Impairment of receivables is not taxable for banks, saving institutions, and insurance companies if impaired in accordance with the methods prescribed by law. As to other corporate taxpayers, impairment of receivables is a taxable expense, excluding the receivables from entities under bankruptcy or liquidation procedure (if confirmed within these procedures).
Write-off of receivables is a taxable expense for all corporate taxpayers.
On the other hand, taxpayers are entitled to decrease the tax base for the amount of collected receivables (taxed in previous years) in the year of collection.
## Charitable contributions
Donations and sponsorships expenses are taxable if not pursuant to the manner, the conditions, and the procedure set forth in the Law on Donations and Sponsorships in Public Activities. If compliant with the law requirements as per above, donations in public activities are taxable if the annual amount borne by the taxpayer exceeds 5% of its overall revenue, whereas sponsorship expenses are taxable if above 3% of the overall revenue of the taxpayer.
The above incentive could be utilised by meeting certain statutory-prescribed criteria.
## Compensation expenses
Employees’ related expenditures (e.g. organised transportation to/from work, canteen, business trip allowance, field allowance, family separation allowance, one-off severance payment, retirement allowance, annual holiday allowance, anniversary awards) are taxable on the part exceeding the amount prescribed by law and collective agreement. According to the latest amendments, the taxation of these expenditures is not linked to their payment. However, taxpayers are allowed to decrease the tax base if the provisions for these expenses are cancelled in future tax periods for the amount of recognised revenue due to such cancellation.
Voluntary pension insurance contributions are taxable if their annual amount per employee exceeds two average monthly gross salaries paid out in the country for the previous calendar year.
The monthly allowances and expenses for the managing board members are tax-deductible, up to 50% of the average gross monthly salary paid out in the country for the previous year.
Expenses made for accommodation (up to 4 star hotels and in the daily amount of up to MKD 6,000 per person) and transport of non-payroll employees engaged at the taxpayer for the purposes of its business activities are tax deductible, provided they are properly documented.
Depending on the period of the internship contract, the tax-deductible internship allowance could be in the range between 42% to 100% of the minimum net monthly salary paid out in the country.
The monthly allowance for practical trainings of students is tax deductible up to MKD 8,000 per person.
## Insurance expenses
Voluntary health insurance premiums are taxable if their annual amount per employee exceeds one average monthly gross salary, paid out in the previous calendar year.
Voluntary pension contributions paid to the private pension fund are taxable if their annual amount per employee exceeds two average monthly gross salaries, paid out in the previous calendar year.
Other insurance premiums paid for members of the management board and the employees (if not paid out from their salary) are taxable expenses. Only the collective insurance of the employees for work-related injuries is a non-taxable expense for corporate taxpayers.
## Entertainment expenses
Expenses for gifts, business dinners, recreation, and entertainment are taxable, up to 90% of the annual amount borne by the taxpayer.
## Scrapping
Expenses for scrapping exceeding the standards for the particular industry set forth in the rulebook on the standardised amounts of debris, scrap, waste, wreckage, and scattering of goods and specific products are taxable. Scrapping expenses caused by *vis major* or an uncontrollable event are not taxable.
## Fines, penalties, and taxes
Fines and tax penalties, penalty interest on unpaid public duties, and expenses for enforced payments, as well as withholding tax (WHT) borne by the taxpayer on behalf of third parties, are taxable.
## Net operating losses
The CIT Law stipulates that the loss realised in the income statement for the year, adjusted for the amount of non-deductible expenses, can be carried forward against future profits for a maximum period of three years as of the year when the profit has been realised.
On the other hand, the loss realised for 2020 and 2021 can be carried forward against future profits for a maximum period of five years as of the year when the profit has been realised.
Loss carrybacks are not allowed under the Macedonian tax legislation.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no specific provisions in the tax legislation with regard to payments towards foreign affiliates.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
There are no tax consolidation provisions in North Macedonia.
## Transfer pricing
### New transfer pricing legislation
The CIT Law and the Transfer Pricing Rulebook have introduced new provisions in respect of transfer prices applied between related parties from 1 January 2019 onwards. The above legislation prescribed detailed rules on transfer pricing, both in terms of substantial and transfer pricing reporting aspects.
### Transfer pricing reporting requirements
The amended tax legislation outlines new transfer pricing reporting requirements for taxpayers, as follows:
The above-mentioned transfer pricing reports should be prepared in Macedonian language and should be submitted to the tax authorities within 15 days of their request.
### Detailed definition of related parties
According to the new transfer pricing legislation, two persons would be considered as related in the following situations:
For the purpose of the above paragraphs, the shares or voting rights of a natural person shall be considered together with those of the spouse, the relatives in a vertical line, the siblings, the guardians, and the adoptive parents.
### Full Transfer Pricing Report
In general, the Full Transfer Pricing Report should include a:
The elements of the Master File and the Local File are generally aligned with the elements prescribed in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
### Short Transfer Pricing Report
The Short Transfer Pricing Report should contain data for each category of transactions (i.e. a group of transactions of the same type) as follows:
### Transfer pricing methods, comparables, and market range of comparables’ data
The new legislation prescribes five transfer pricing methods (instead of the previous two) that can be used for determination of the transfer price upon transactions with related parties.
The prescribed methods are:
The taxpayer should choose the most appropriate method in accordance with the arm’s-length principle and should choose a method for each type or category of transactions. If necessary, in specific cases, a combination of several methods may be used.
## Thin capitalisation
A proportional part of the interest related to a loan received from a non-resident shareholder, who directly holds at least 20% of the capital in the company, that exceeds three times its share in the equity in the company will be taxable during a tax period. Thin capitalisation rules also apply to loans from banks if they are granted in relation to a deposit of the shareholder in that particular bank. Note that thin capitalisation rules do not apply for newly established companies within the first three years of operation.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in North Macedonia.

## Foreign tax credit
The taxpayer is allowed a tax credit for the tax paid on foreign income abroad, up to the amount of tax payable for that income in North Macedonia. However, a tax credit for the WHT paid abroad is allowed only if a double tax treaty (DTT) is in place and in case the Macedonian company obtains proof for the amount of tax paid in the foreign country.
## Reinvested profit
The CIT Law introduces a possibility for decreasing the tax base for the year for the amount of profit reinvested for development purposes of the local taxpayer. The amounts from the reinvested profit that would be recognised for the purposes of the above tax relief cover investments both in tangible and intangible assets, except for some explicitly listed types of assets intended for administrative purposes.
In order to be able to utilise the above tax relief, the taxpayers must maintain ownership over the assets purchased with the reinvested profit for a period of five years as of the day of their purchase. If the taxpayer sells the assets before the expiration of the five-year period, the taxpayer owes the respective CIT.

## Income from copyrights and related rights
Income from copyrights is the compensation realised by the individual from artwork and related rights regulated under the Law on Copyrights and Related rights (e.g. paintings, artistic work in music, film, etc.). The tax base is decreased by the amount of recognised expenses that range between 20% and 50%.
## Income from sale of own agricultural products
Income from sale of one's own agricultural products consists of sale of own agricultural products to payers that keep accounting records and to natural persons if the sale took place outside organised green markets.
The tax base is 20% of the gross income realised.
The taxpayer whose total income in the year exceeds the amount of 1 million Macedonian denars (MKD) shall be required to register for business activity in accordance with the legislation by 15 January of the following year, at the latest.
If the taxpayer during the calendar year generates income from sale of one's own agricultural products not exceeding MKD 1 million, such taxpayer shall have the right to recover the tax paid thereof, provided the taxpayer has not realised any other income that is taxable under the PIT Law.
## Income from intellectual property (IP) rights

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
Irrespective of their citizenship, individuals are considered Macedonian tax residents if they have a permanent or temporary residence in the country. The individual is considered to have a temporary residence in North Macedonia if one stays in the country continuously or intermittently for 183 days or more within any 12-month period.
If a double tax treaty (DTT) is in place, the 183-day residency principle is applicable in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.
A foreign tax resident is any individual who is not a Macedonian tax resident.
