Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Special income tax (SIT)
Subject to international tax treaties, an SIT is levied by the state or regional and local authorities on income paid to natural persons and corporate bodies domiciled abroad by individuals or legal entities located in Cameroon. The tax is withheld at source by the Cameroonian entity or individual paying the remuneration.
Subject to international tax treaties, the SIT rates are fixed as follows:
## Non-commercial profits WHT
A 16.5% WHT is to be deducted at source by entities that pay remunerations granted to the board members of public institutions, public corporations, and semi-public companies in any capacity.
The tax rate applicable to non-commercial revenue is 11% to be deducted at source by entities that pay the following:
## Dividends WHT
A total WHT of 16.5% applies to dividends paid to both Cameroon residents and non-residents. The WHT rate may be reduced under an applicable DTT.
## Interest WHT
The interest from foreign loans is subject to 16.5% WHT. The WHT rate may be reduced under an applicable DTT.
Interests on external loans of a maturity period of at least seven years, signed as of 1 January 2014, are exempted from the WHT.
## Royalties WHT
Royalties paid to non-residents are subject to a 15% WHT (the 10% surcharge is not applicable). The tax rate may vary under some DTTs.
## Tax treaties
Cameroon has tax treaties with Canada, France, Morocco, South Africa, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and members of CEMAC (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Republic of Congo).

## Inventory valuation
For valuation purpose, the GTC only provides that stocks shall be valued at cost price; however, if the market price is lower than the cost price, the undertaking shall make provisions for depreciation of inventory. No reference is made to the accounting method that shall be used (e.g. first in first out [FIFO], last in first out [LIFO]). Only FIFO and weighted average methods are allowed under the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) Accounting Principles. Where there is any difference between the valuation method permitted by the GTC and the book valuation, the accounting result shall be modified accordingly.
Firms shall, by 15 March, submit a summary of all the stock movements of the financial year concerned, together with the software used in managing the said stock. The summary of inventory movements should be produced in dematerialised form.
The right of ascertainment of stocks by the tax administration shall allow tax officers to conduct unannounced on-site operations to physically audit the stocks of one or several products of the non-prescribed period. A notice of passage shall be remitted to the taxpayer or representative during the first intervention within the framework of such audit.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are normally taxed at full CIT rates.
The net overall capital gains arising from the transfer of shares and stocks; income from bonds; income from debts, deposits, surety-bonds, and current accounts; profits realised from the transfer of shares; reimbursement of sums put at the disposal of the company by a manager or a partner as an advance or a loan; income from digital assets; and capital gains on the transfer of rights relating to natural resources shall be subject to 16.5% WHT.
For transfers realised abroad, the Cameroonian law enterprise and the transferor shall be jointly and severally liable to payment of the sums due under such transfer.
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to the WHT of 16.5%. However, dividends shall be treated as proceeds for the purpose of CIT, and the tax withheld at source is used as instalment for the payment of CIT.
## Interest income
Interests are subject to the WHT of 16.5%. However, interests shall be treated as proceeds for the purpose of CIT, and the tax withheld at source shall be used as instalment for the payment of CIT.
Interests on external loans of a maturity period of at least seven years, signed as of 1 January 2014, are exempted from the WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalties received from foreign entities shall be included in the taxable income subject to CIT, subject to double tax treaties (DTTs).
## Foreign income
As a matter of both fact and law, revenue from abroad earned by corporate bodies situated in Cameroon shall be subject to CIT in Cameroon. There is no provision on tax deferral in Cameroon.

The employee contributes only for the portion covering the old age pension, permanent and total disability pension, and survival pension. The rate is 4.2% based on the taxable salary, which shall be capped at XAF 750,000 per month (i.e. XAF 9 million per year). The rate for voluntary insurance for this contribution is 8.4%.
## Housing Fund and the National Employment Fund
Contributions for the Cameroon Housing Fund (*Crédit Foncier du Cameroun*) are made at the rate of 1% of taxable salary paid by the employee and 1.5% paid by the employer.
Contributions for the National Employment Fund (FNE) are made at the rate of 1% of taxable salary paid by the employer.
## Capital gains taxes
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT shall be levied on natural persons or corporate bodies that automatically, habitually, or occasionally carry out taxable transactions consisting of provisions of services or sales of goods.
The total VAT in Cameroon is 19.25%. Exports are zero rated. The VAT paid upstream is recoverable, except where otherwise stated.
Note that VAT is invoiced only by natural and legal persons whose turnover (taxes excluded) is equal to or above XAF 50 million and who are under the tax regime of actual earnings.
## Property taxes
Cameroon property tax is payable annually on real estate with or without an ownership certificate or an administrative or judicial order issued. Tax is charged at 0.1% of the assessed property value.
According to the 2016 Finance Law, taxpayers who voluntarily regularise their property tax in the 2016 financial year shall be exempted from the payment of tax arrears for the non-prescribed period as well as from related penalties. At the end of the 2016 financial year, no tax or penalty remission will be granted on the land tax for the non-prescribed period.
## Luxury and excise taxes
An excise duty between 25% and 50% is applicable to cigarettes, drinks, cosmetics, luxury items (e.g. jewels, precious stones), slot machines, and other devices used for games of chance. A medium rate of excise duty (12.5%) shall apply to soft drinks and private vehicles with engine capacities of 2,000 cm³. A reduced rate of 5% is applicable to games of chance and games of entertainment not subject to the special tax on games of chance and games of entertainment.
There is an extra-reduced rate of excise duties at 2% applicable to mobile telephone communications and Internet services.
There are minimum excise duties applicable to alcoholic beverages and tobacco. For tobacco, the minimum tax shall not be less than XAF 5,000 for 1,000 cigarette rods. For alcoholic beverages, the minimum tax depends on the nature of the alcohol and the alcohol level per litre.
Some arms and their parts, as well as ammunition, (of Chapter 93 of the CEMAC Code) imported by persons other than those governed by public law shall be subject to excise duty at the rate of 25% of the taxable value.
## Council tax
The council tax depends on the salary amount; however, for salaries beyond XAF 500,000, the tax amounts to XAF 2,520 per month.
## Cameroon Radio and Television (CRTV) royalty
The taxpayer is bound to pay a royalty to CRTV. The amount of the royalty is fixed in a scale based on gross salary. The highest amount is XAF 13,000 for a gross salary amounting above XAF 1 million.

# Cameroon, Republic of
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
Resident corporations in Cameroon are taxed on their worldwide income; non-resident corporations are taxed only on Cameroon-source income.
The following shall be deemed to be operating in Cameroon and subject to corporate income tax (CIT):
The profits subject to CIT are determined with sole regard to profits earned by entities located in Cameroon (for residents) or transactions effected in Cameroon (for non-residents having a permanent establishment [PE] in Cameroon).
The net taxable profits are established after deduction of all charges directly entailed by the exercise of activities subject to assessment in Cameroon.
The total Cameroon CIT rate is 33% for companies with a turnover above XAF 3 billion. For companies with a turnover of less than XAF 3 billion that meet the additional criteria set by law, the tax rate is set at 27.5%.
## Taxation system/regime
Corporate bodies are assessed according to the following taxation systems determined on the basis of the turnover realised:
It should be noted that, as of 1 January 2023, the turnover achieved is no longer the criterion for inclusion in the actual system for certain legal entities. The following legal entities are automatically included in this regime, regardless of their turnover:
## Minimum tax
There is a 2.2% or 5.5% minimum tax in Cameroon based on turnover and depending on the tax regime of the taxpayer. The advance payment shall be 10% for any taxpayer that is not on the register of a tax office. The 10% rate shall be increased to 20% for forestry companies where, in addition, they do not provide evidence of possessing a logging permit duly issued by the competent authority.
The 10% rate also applies to remunerations paid to non-salaried sales agents or representatives and agents of direct network sales. The 15% rate applies to taxpayers not registered with a taxation centre and engaged in import activities. The 15% rate shall be increased to 20% where the taxpayer carries out the sale of in-bond goods.
The rate of deduction at source representing the instalment of CIT is fixed at 5.5%, irrespective of the tax regime of the service provider, for invoices relating to public procurement amounting to less than XAF 5 million.
The advance payment shall be 15.04% of the gross margin for firms subject to the actual earnings tax system and falling under regulated profit margin sectors, subject to the option for the tax regime of common application. In case of mixed activities, there is a mandatory application of the 2.2% rate on the share of turnover relating to the free margin.
A monthly instalment of 1.1% of the turnover of the commercial activities of non-profit organisations shall be paid each month.
This minimum tax is an instalment of CIT. As such, it shall be offset against CIT. The minimum tax is the sole tax payable if it is greater than CIT.
## Local income taxes
A local tax of 10%, called Additional Council Tax, generally applies to the following taxes:
The rate provided in this summary for each tax above is therefore inclusive of a basic rate plus 10% surcharge.

# Cameroon, Republic of
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Cameroon is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Taxpayers are expected to submit to the tax administration the annual return of revenue derived from their business venture during the period serving as the tax base by:
This return must be presented in conformity with the OHADA accounting system.
No one may invoke a claim on the state to shirk its return and payment obligations.
Despite the declarative tax system applicable in Cameroon, the tax administration may send a pre-completed return of collected revenue or any other taxable item, with the tax amount owed, to any natural or legal person paying taxes or duties as per laws and regulations in force.
The taxpayer that feels overtaxed or wrongfully taxed under a pre-filled tax return procedure shall submit a request for correction to the competent taxation centre within one month of receipt of such return. In such case, the tax authorities and the taxpayer shall have 30 days within which to decide the final taxes established by a collection notice (CN).
Failure to pay within 15 days of receiving the CN or respond to a pre-filled tax return in time shall be tantamount to accepting the terms thereof.
### Other tax filings
Firms falling under a dispensational or special tax regime shall file, within the same time limit, a summary declaration of transactions of the previous year for which they obtained tax benefits, including theoretical taxes and levies corresponding to the said transactions.
Firms shall, within the same time limit, submit to the tax administration a summary of all the stock movements of the previous year, together with the software used in managing the said stock.
Approved intermediaries shall, through electronic means, provide the Directorate General of Customs, on a monthly basis, the information on the status of all foreign financial transactions carried out with their customers and on their personal behalf.
## Payment of tax
An instalment representing the 2.2% or 5.5% minimum tax of turnover realised during each month shall be paid to the tax authorities not later than the 15th day of the following month.
The balance of CIT is paid, at the latest, by:
following the fiscal year-end, when submitting the CIT return.
### Surplus tax payments
A surplus tax payment can be offset against future taxes of the same nature to be paid.
Excess payments of CIT shall be reimbursed in case of cessation of activities.
For the specific case of VAT, a reimbursement procedure is provided for by the GTC under certain conditions. Such VAT credit refund procedure shall depend on whether the taxpayer is classified in the category of low, medium, or high-risk company.
## Tax audit process
There is no audit cycle in Cameroon.
As of January 2018, whatever the cause, any importer or exporter wishing to terminate one's customs activities shall first inform the customs administration at least 90 days beforehand and request a customs audit. In the absence of this prior audit, the taxpayer concerned, the taxpayer's officials, and/or the taxpayer's representatives shall remain jointly and severally liable for the customs debts subsequently established.

# Cameroon, Republic of
## Overview
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
The Republic of Cameroon, a country located in Central and Western Africa, is bordered by Nigeria and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Chad to the northeast, the Central African Republic to the east, and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo to the south. Cameroon is divided into ten regions, with Yaoundé as the capital. Cameroon's currency is the *Communauté Financière Africaine* franc (XAF), and its official languages are French and English.
Cameroon has generally enjoyed stability, which has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Because of its oil resources and favourable agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. International oil and cocoa prices have a significant impact on the economy. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalise the nation's banks.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT shall be levied on natural persons or corporate bodies that automatically, habitually, or occasionally carry out taxable transactions consisting of provisions of services or sales of goods.
The total VAT in Cameroon is 19.25%. Exports are zero rated. The VAT paid upstream is recoverable, except where otherwise stated.
Note that VAT is invoiced only by natural and legal persons whose turnover (taxes excluded) is equal to or above XAF 50 million and who are under the tax regime of actual earnings.
## Customs duties
Customs duties of between 5% and 30%, depending on the nature of the goods imported, are levied based on the customs value.
Goods acquired electronically and imported into Cameroon shall be subject to customs duties and taxes under conditions laid down by regulation.
The rate of the Common External Tariff (CET) has been re-established on some products, such as rice and cement. As such, the import of rice, which previously benefitted from the suspension of duties and taxes, is henceforth subject to the CET at the rate of 5%, and the CET rate has been revised upwards for some types of cement.
There is an African Integration Contribution (AIC) at the rate of 0.2% applicable to the taxable value of goods imported from third party countries into the African Union.
The ceiling of the computer fee, which rate is 0.45%, shall be fixed at XAF 15,000 per export declaration.
As of 1January 2018, interest for late payment at the rate of 1.5% per month (capped at 50%) has been instituted for persons who have failed to pay taxes and customs duties 30 days after the computation of the detailed declaration.
The Preferential Tariff (PT) of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) entered into force in Cameroon on 1 January 2018. As of this date, Cameroonian goods exported in the countries of the ECCAS shall be exempt from customs duty. Goods from those countries shall be subject to zero-rate customs duty.
Countries of the ECCAS include Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and São Tomé and Príncipe.
## Excise taxes
An excise duty between 25% and 50% is applicable to cigarettes, drinks, cosmetics, luxury items (e.g. jewels, precious stones), slot machines, and other devices used for games of chance. A medium rate of excise duty (12.5%) shall apply to soft drinks and private vehicles with engine capacities of 2,000 cm³. A reduced rate of 5% is applicable to games of chance and games of entertainment not subject to the special tax on games of chance and games of entertainment.
There is an extra-reduced rate of excise duties at 2% applicable to mobile telephone communications and Internet services.
There are minimum excise duties applicable to alcoholic beverages and tobacco. For tobacco, the minimum tax shall not be less than XAF 5,000 for 1,000 cigarette rods. For alcoholic beverages, the minimum tax depends on the nature of the alcohol and the alcohol level per litre.
Some arms and their parts, as well as ammunition, (of Chapter 93 of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa [CEMAC] Code) imported by persons other than those governed by public law shall be subject to excise duty at the rate of 25% of the taxable value.
## Real property tax
Cameroon property tax is payable annually on real estate with or without an ownership certificate or an administrative or judicial order issued. Tax is charged at 0.1% of the assessed property value.
Properties belonging to clubs, associations, or sporting bodies' accredited properties intended for sports and sports facilities are exempt from real property tax.
## Transfer tax
The sale of a business in Cameroon is subject to a transfer tax rate of 10%. The massive transfer of shares is subject to 5% registration duties when they do not entail the transfer of the business.
## Registration duty
The registration duty applies to certain deeds listed by the General Tax Code (GTC). The assessment basis depends on the nature of transactions, and the rate varies from 1% to 15%.
The formation of a company and subsequent capital increases in Cameroon are not subject to registration duty.
Public contracts or procurements for amounts of less than XAF 5 million, paid from the budget of the state, local, and regional authorities, administrative public establishments, or from external funding, shall be subject to registration duty at the rate of 7%.
Public contracts and procurements paid from the budget of state-owned companies and semi-public corporations shall be subject to registration duty at the rate of 5% or 3% where the amount is, respectively, less or more than XAF 50 million.
Public orders for fuels and lubricants, regardless of the purchase or payment method, shall be exempted from registration duty and stamp duty.
The following transactions are subject to registration duty at the rate of 2%:
Collateral and mortgage loans with microfinance institutions of the first category, as well as the related releases, surety bonds, and guarantees, shall henceforth be exempted from the registration formality and the payment of graduated stamp duty.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty in CEMAC countries is established, independent of registration fees, on all papers to be used for civil and legal instruments and documents that may be brought before law courts as proof. It shall be collected on the basis and in accordance with the rules laid down in the GTC.
Stamp duty shall be fixed according to the nature of the instruments subject thereto. There shall be no exemptions except those expressly indicated in the GTC.
The minimum stamp duty depending on paper size, which was initially set at XAF 1,000, has been raised to XAF 1,500.
## Payroll tax
Employers in Cameroon are required to make monthly contributions of 2.5% of the total amount of salaries and fringe benefits of their employees to the Housing Loan and Employment Fund of Cameroon.
## Social security contributions
Employer and employee must contribute on a monthly basis to Cameroon’s National Social Insurance Fund at 11.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The basis of contribution is capped at XAF 750,000 per month (i.e. XAF 9 million per year). Employers in Cameroon must also contribute 1.75%, 2.5%, or 5% of total salaries to the National Social Insurance Fund for Industrial Accidents when they are respectively classified in groups A, B, or C according to the classification per type of activity. The calculation basis in this category is the gross salary, including the benefits in kind assessed for their actual amount.
## Business licence tax
Any natural person or corporate body carrying on a trade, industry, or profession in Cameroon shall be liable to a business licence tax. The business licence tax is paid annually and shall be calculated by applying a rate to the turnover of the previous financial year-ended as follows:
New enterprises shall be exempt from the payment of the business licence tax during the first year of operation.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
All persons with a fiscal domicile in Cameroon shall, in principle, be taxed on their worldwide revenue by Cameroon.
The basis of this tax is the sum of net income from various categories of revenue earned by the taxpayer within one fiscal year.
## Personal income tax rates
Subject to international conventions to the contrary, personal income tax (PIT) on salaries is calculated by applying the following progressive scale to the overall net income rounded down to the nearest thousand *Communauté Financière Africaine* francs (XAF):
| Net income (XAF) | PIT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 2,000,000 | 11 |
| 2,000,001 to 3,000,000 | 16.5 |
| 3,000,001 to 5,000,000 | 27.5 |
| more than 5,000,000 | 38.5 |
The net incomes from other activities are subject to income tax at 33%.
## Minimum tax
Whatever the case, except the cases of workers and natural persons subject to the discharging system, the minimum tax is 2.2% or 5.5% of turnover, depending on the tax regime applicable to the taxpayer.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the useful life according to the rates provided for by the GTC, including those that might have already been deferred in times of deficit.
The following depreciation rates are generally accepted for tax purposes:
| Assets | Depreciation rates (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Construction | 5 to 20 |
| Stationary equipment and tools | 5 to 20 |
| Portable equipment | 10 to 100 |
| Transport equipment | 10 to 33.33 |
| Railway lines | 1 to 10 |
| Engines | 5 |
| Rehabilitation | 5 to 25 |
| Furniture fittings and other equipment | 10 to 33.33 |
| Fishing equipment and fishing vessels | 15 |
The deduction of depreciation can be carried forward indefinitely.
The threshold for small equipment and tools to be included in the balance sheet shall be XAF 500,000.
Depreciation rates specific to certain sectors of activity may be fixed by a separate joint instrument of the ministers in charge of finance and the sector concerned.
## Goodwill
With regard to rules governing the deduction of provisions and depreciation, impairment of goodwill shall be allowable for CIT purposes.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific provision in the GTC relating to start-up expenses.
However, the OHADA Accounting Principles effectively state that start-up expenses shall be capitalised and must be completely depreciated as early as possible: over two to five years, except bond premiums, which are depreciated throughout the life of the loan.
No distribution of profit should be carried out before the complete depreciation of start-up expenses.
## Intellectual property (IP)
Sums paid to related entities for the use of valid patents, brands, designs, and models are capped at the overall limit of 2.5% of the taxable income before the deduction of expenses claimed. When they are paid to entities located outside the CEMAC that directly or indirectly hold shares or are members of the Cameroonian entity's board of directors, they shall be considered as sums accruing from the distribution of profits. As such, they are not allowable.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are fully deductible.
However, the deduction of interests on sums of money left or placed at the disposal of local entities by partners or related companies who directly or indirectly own at least 25% of the share capital or corporate voting rights is capped at:
Otherwise, interests on the excess amount shall not be deductible. In this case, the excess interests paid are added back for CIT purpose and subject to distribution tax at the rate of 16.5%.
Where the two situations are met, the tax authorities will choose the one that generates the highest tax liability.
The deduction above is applicable where the following conditions are met:
## Bad debt
The deductibility of provisions for bad debts is subject to the following conditions:
For losses related to bad debts to be deductible, they should have been subjected to all amicable or forced collection methods and means provided for by the OHADA Uniform Act on the Organization of Simplified Procedures for Collection and Enforcement Procedures. Otherwise, they shall not be deductible.
In this regard, the impossibility of recovering the debt must be evidenced by:
However, losses due to bad debts of an amount less that XAF 500,000, which have been provisioned over a minimum period of five years, shall be deducted automatically, without having to justify the exhaustion of the amicable or forced recovery procedures provided for by the regulations in force.
## Charitable contributions
Acts of liberality, gifts, and subsidies shall not represent the charges deductible from profits.
Liberalities, gifts, and subsidies awarded to clubs participating in the elite national competitions or to recognised organisations responsible for the organisation of official sport competitions are deductible, provided they are justified, within the limit of 5% of the annual turnover.
## Fines and penalties
Compounding fees, fines, confiscations, and any penalty concerning persons who violate legal, economic, and fiscal provisions shall not be deducted from the profits subject to taxation.
## Taxes
Only the professional taxes issued for collection during the fiscal year and which are to be borne by the firm in relation to the operations carried out in Cameroon shall be subject to deduction.
CIT, WHT, and PIT shall not be considered as deductible expenses for the levying of taxes.
## Net operating losses
Any loss sustained in a given year can be carried forward up to the fourth year following the recording of the loss. The carryback of losses is not permitted in Cameroon.
For credit institutions and companies in the state portfolio undergoing restructuring, the excess deficit can be carried over to the sixth year following the deficit year.
Losses due to damage in inventories shall be deductible from the taxable basis when they are duly established and validated by a Commissioner of damage in the presence of a taxation officer with the rank of at least controller, under the conditions specified in the Manual of Tax Procedures.
However, for damages and breakages incurred by companies in the brewing sector, the related losses are deducted at a flat rate of 1% of the total production volume.
## Payments to foreign entities
Head office overhead expenses for operations carried out in Cameroon and the remuneration of certain effective services (studies, technical, financial, or accounting assistance) provided to Cameroonian firms by foreign natural persons or corporate bodies are not totally deductible.
Fees paid are deductible up to a maximum of:
The notion of technical assistance shall include services provided by entities located either overseas or in Cameroon.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
There is specific taxation of groups within the CEMAC area.
Where a joint stock company and a private limited company own either registered stock in a joint stock company or shares in a private limited company, the net proceeds of the share in the second company paid to the first during the financial year shall be deducted from the total net profit of the latter, less a percentage for costs and charges. This percentage is fixed at 10% of the total amount of the proceeds. This system shall apply when all of the following conditions are met:
## Transfer pricing
There are provisions in the GTC that relate to transfer pricing.
Within the framework of a tax audit, the documents required for the justification of transfer pricing shall be presented to the tax inspectors at the start of the procedure. Items such as business transactions, payments in consideration for intangible rights, allocations of costs and expenses (head office costs, agreements to share costs, disbursements, etc.), financial transactions, etc. are particularly targeted for close scrutiny.
Companies in the large taxpayers unit shall declare participation in companies that are equal to or more than 25% of the share capital of the latter, as well as the documentation to justify their transfer pricing policy for intra-group transactions, at the same time as their annual tax return.
Companies with a transfer pricing policy for cross-border trade in goods and services are required to submit their transfer pricing documentation to the customs authorities by 31 March of each year at the latest. The failure to transmit this declaration is assimilated to the offence of refusal to communicate the documents and is sanctioned.
Since 1 January 2024, financial institutions and similar bodies (including banks, financial establishments, and insurance companies) have been required to:
## Thin capitalisation
The deduction of interests on sums of money left or placed at the disposal of local entities by partners or related companies who directly or indirectly own at least 25% of the share capital or corporate voting rights is capped at:
Otherwise, interests on the excess amount shall not be deductible.
The deduction above is applicable where the following conditions are met:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
We are not aware of any special provisions for CFCs. Indeed, subject to the provisions of international conventions and the provisions relating to group taxation mentioned above, revenue from stocks and shares held in a company based abroad shall be subject to income tax in Cameroon.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
The local branch of any foreign company is taxed at the same rate as a company. The net profits (after CIT) of entities having their residence or head office outside Cameroon (such as the branch of a foreign company) are assumed to be distributed each fiscal year to companies not located in Cameroon. Their net profits (after CIT) shall therefore be subject to the WHT on distributions at 16.5%.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Taxes paid abroad are not considered as tax credits unless provided as such by DTTs.
## The system of reinvestment relief
This system of reinvestment relief previously provided by the GTC has been cancelled by the 2015 Finance Law.
## The private investment tax incentive regime
The private investment tax incentive regime instituted by Law No. 2013/04 of 18 April 2013 applies to investment operations relating to the creation, extension, renewal, refurbishing of assets, and/or the transformation of activities carried out in Cameroon.
The major tax advantages related to the private investment regime in Cameroon are the following:
Tax and customs incentives granted to investors consist of exemptions from or reductions of payment of several taxes, duties, and other fees listed.
According to the 2017 Finance Law, conventions and agreements signed by the authorities that provide for customs and tax exemptions and waivers shall, under pain of unenforceability, be subject to prior approval by the Minister in charge of finance.
Individuals or legal entities benefiting from tax and customs incentives contained in the conventions with various administrative authorities and not ratified by the Parliament shall, in accordance with the 2017 Finance Law and within the deadline of two years from the promulgation of the 2018 Finance Law (20 December 2017), negotiate the harmonisation of the provisions of the said conventions with the above-mentioned law on private investment incentives with the Ministry in charge of finance.
The Finance Law for the 2023 financial year enshrines the possibility for the Investment Promotion Agency, on a proposal from the tax and customs administrations, to withdraw from a beneficiary the approval of a tax incentive scheme in the event of non-compliant use.
## Incentives applicable to listed companies
Companies whose ordinary shares are listed on the Cameroon Stock Exchange shall be entitled to the following:
Companies that issue stocks on the Cameroon Stock Exchange shall be entitled to a reduced CIT rate of 25% (i.e. 27.5% including 10% additional council tax) for a period of three years, with effect from the year of issue.
## Specific tax incentives
The following may benefit from specific tax incentives:

The finance law for the financial year 2021 requires non-professional taxpayers (employees) to file a declaration by 30 June each year at the latest with the tax office of their residence.
The annual summary income tax return can be subscribed online using a form provided by the tax authorities. It indicates by category of income:
Any declaration showing a balance of taxes to be regularised must be accompanied by means of payment. These payments can be made electronically by mobile phone, by bank transfer, by telepayment, or in cash at bank counters.
After validation by the competent services, declarations that show an overpayment give rise to a refund or deduction from future taxes at the request of the taxpayer.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
Personal gross income is made up of the following categories of income:
The assessment of taxable income in each of these categories is governed by its own special rules.
## Employment income
For employment income, the basis of assessment is the gross amount of all wages, pensions, salaries, and annuities, as well as benefits in kind or in cash granted to the person concerned.
However, a wide range of allowances are exempted from taxation. They are, *inter alia*, special allowances to cover inherent duty and services expenses, family allowances and benefits, benefits paid by any state authority by virtue of the law, scholarships, temporary allowances, and benefits and life annuities paid to victims of industrial accidents and other rightful claimants.
Benefits in kind are assessed as follows on the basis of the taxable income:
Benefits in kind not listed are estimated at their actual cost.
Any cash allowance representing benefits in kind shall be included in the basis of assessment for its actual amount, unless they are specifically exempted by a contrary provision.
Vacation fare for expatriate workers and their family is not taxable.
## Income from stocks and shares
