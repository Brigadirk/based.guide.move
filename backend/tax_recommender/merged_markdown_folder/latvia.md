## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Taxable period
## Tax returns
Items subject to CIT should be reported either monthly or annually, depending on the nature of the items. In general, items subject to CIT should be included in the tax return for the tax period in which costs were incurred. If a tax base arises, a tax return should be filed each month on or before the 20th day of the following tax period. If a tax return is not filed with the SRS, this will mean that no tax liability arose in that month. The tax base can be adjusted for non-business expenses only in the month they were incurred. Accordingly, if an adjustment is still needed, a late fee will be charged.
It is mandatory for taxpayers to file a tax return for the last month of the financial year.
The transition rules govern cases where a taxpayer’s financial year is different from a calendar year. In that case, the taxpayer should prepare interim financial statements and the CIT return.
## Payment of tax
If a tax base arises, the tax charge should be paid each month on or before the 23rd day of the following tax period.
## Tax audit process
A tax audit begins with an audit note for open tax years (*please see Statute of limitations below*). An audit may last a few weeks or a few months, but not exceeding 90 days. It can be extended to 60 days if information is requested from a foreign tax authority. If a simultaneous tax audit with a foreign tax authority is initiated, then such extension is not limited.
The SRS should inform the taxpayer of a tax audit no later than ten working days before the start of the audit with notification about documents the SRS would like to see.
During a tax audit, the auditors will notify the taxpayer about any irregularities in the calculation of tax payments and any fines that could be levied. Before issuing the tax audit decision, the auditors will invite the taxpayer to final negotiations to discuss the tax audit results.
Following the tax audit and notification of its findings, the company may take the following steps:
## Statute of limitations
The SRS may collect any unpaid taxes within three years after tax payment was due. Transfer prices may be examined for five years. If taxable income adjustments arise from transfer pricing risks and hybrid mismatches, the tax audit and the tax control may cover five years after the statutory due date for payment.
The SRS tends to scrutinise:

## National social insurance contributions (NSIC)
As of 1 July 2021, a minimum NSIC object of a minimum wage (EUR 740 for 2025) has been introduced. In case an individual earns less from all NSIC taxable income sources, the employer is responsible for making the contributions on employees’ behalf.
Individuals employed by multiple employers or individuals who are both self-employed and employees must sum their total income to determine whether the income is within the minimum amount.
Since January 2014, income attracting NSIC has been capped. In 2025, the cap is EUR 105,300.
The contribution rates are summarised in this table:
| Employment | 2025 (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Employment with company registered in Latvia/EU/EEA (split rate): |  |
| Employer | 23.59 |
| Employee | 10.50 |
| Employment with company registered in Latvia/EU/EEA (employee eligible for retirement) (split rate): |  |
| Employer | 20.77 |
| Employee | 9.25 |
| Foreign national employed by foreign non-resident employer (full rate payable by either employer or employee): | 31.83 |
| Self-employed | 31.07 |
| Self-employed (eligible for retirement) | 29.36 |
NSIC should be reported and paid quarterly in the case of self-employed persons, whereas monthly contributions are required to be withheld, reported, and paid by Latvian employers.
A 10% NSIC should be contributed by self-employed individuals and payers of royalties, as follows:
## Solidarity tax (ST)
ST has been in place since 1 January 2016. ST is applicable on income that exceeds the maximum income attracting NSIC, i.e. EUR 105,300 a year in 2025, and during the year is payable at the same rate as NSIC: 23.59% for employer and 10.5% for employee. However, the effective ST rate is 25%. Thus, for the contributions made e.g. in 2025, the employer will receive ST refund by September 2026.
The ST paid will be split as follows:
The ST Act does not provide for a different split if a person’s NSIC rate is lower than the standard rate. Thus the fixed percentage points apply to all ST payers regardless of their NSIC status and rates used.
The ST payer is also required under the PIT Act to file their annual tax return between 1 April and 1 July of the following year to recalculate ST and PIT.
## Consumptions taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Latvia.
## Gift taxes
Gifts in any form from individuals are subject to the progressive PIT rate after applying an annual exemption of EUR 1,425 to the value of the gift. Gifts of up to EUR 100 (including VAT) from the employer are exempt from PIT. Gifts between spouses and relatives up to the third degree are fully exempt. Starting from 1 July 2024, the exemption also applies to gifts between persons who have registered a civil partnership.
## Light corporate vehicle tax (LCVT)

## Customs duty
Customs duty is levied on goods imported into Latvia. The rate of customs duty is generally between 0% and 20% of the value of imported goods, depending on their type and origin. Exports are generally exempt.
## Excise
Excise is levied on specified categories of goods, mostly as a fixed amount per unit. Excise applies to the following goods, whether made in Latvia or imported:
| Product | Excise amount |
| --- | --- |
| Oil and oil products | Up to EUR 617 per 1,000 litres, depending on the type of the product. |

| Beer | EUR 9; EUR 4.5 for small breweries for each percent of absolute alcohol, but not less than EUR 16.7 per 100 litres of beer. |
| Tobacco products | EUR 164.7 per 1,000 cigars or cigarillos. |
| EUR 119.6 per 1,000 cigarettes less than 80 mm in length plus 15% of the maximum retail selling price, but not less than EUR 156.3 per 1,000 cigarettes. |
| EUR 208 per 1,000 cigarettes plus 15% of the maximum retail selling price for cigarettes between 80mm and 110mm in length, but not less than EUR 271.8 per 1,000 cigarettes. |
| EUR 312 per 1,000 cigarettes plus 15% of the maximum retail selling price for cigarettes between 111mm and 140mm in length, but not less than EUR 407.7 per 1,000 cigarettes. |

| Tobacco substitutes | EUR 151.8 per 1,000 grams. |
| Natural gas | EUR 3.8 per 1 MWh for use as heating fuel. |
## Real estate tax (RET)
RET is payable annually on:
Municipalities may determine a rate between 0.2% and 3%. A rate above 1.5% may be applied to buildings that are not maintained according to maintenance requirements.
If a municipality does not announce rates by 1 November before the tax period, then statutory rates will apply.
Statutory RET rates are as follows:
A 3% RET applies on buildings under construction if the permitted construction period has expired. The tax is applicable until the building is accepted for use. The rate will be charged on the cadastral value of the related land or on the cadastral value of the building, whichever is higher.
Residential property owned by companies is eligible for reduced rates (0.2% to 0.6%), but only where such property is rented out and tenancy rights properly entered on the Land Register of Latvia.
RET relief of 50% is granted for newly built or fully renovated buildings that are delivered for occupancy after 2023 with international certification such as BREEAM International New Construction, BREEAM Refurbishment and Fit-Out, LEED BD +C, or DGBN certificate with at least a 55% rating.
From 2025, each cadastral item will have two cadastral values – fiscal and universal – computed and registered temporarily.
Fiscal value will be used to compute real estate tax and other charges and will match the current cadastral value (this value is based on the RE market data for 2012–2013).
Universal value will give a fairer view of property value, as it will be based on information on RE market transactions over the period from 1 January 2012 to 1 July 2022, not exceeding 80% of the average RE price level on 1 July 2022. This value can be used, for instance, to set fees for statutory use of land in the case of a split property, as well as in accounting records and financial statements.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duties are levied on certain legal and other kinds of services, such as court trials, company formation and registration, licences for certain types of business activity, provision of information, notary services, operation of bills of exchange, and registration of real estate at the Land Registry (e.g. if real estate is sold, stamp duty is 2% of the deal value or the cadastral value, but not more than EUR 50,000).
Stamp duty is not payable if registration of real estate at the Land Registry is necessary because of a reorganisation. Stamp duty payable to register ownership of immovable property in the case of a contribution in kind to a company’s capital is 1%, but not more than EUR 50,000.
## Payroll taxes
The employer is responsible for withholding personal income tax (PIT) at a rate of 25.5% on income up to EUR 105,300. For the annual income exceeding EUR 105,300, the applicable rate is 33%, which is applied via submission of the individual annual tax return (or compensated by solidarity tax in case NSIC are made in Latvia).
## National social insurance contributions (NSIC)
## Natural resource tax
Any natural resources acquired as a result of economic activities (e.g. surface and underground water, dolomite, quartz sand), the collection of edible park snails, taking advantage of useful features of the bowels of the earth by pumping natural gas or greenhouse gases into geological structures, pollution (waste, emissions, and pollutants), products harmful to the environment (e.g. lubricating oil, electric batteries, oil filters, tyres, textile products, plastic products and products containing plastic), electrical and electronic equipment and appliances, radioactive substances, packaging, disposable tableware, means of transport, the volume of emitted greenhouse gasses that is not included in the number of emission quotas surrendered, coal, coke, and lignite are subject to a natural resource tax in Latvia. The rates are specific for each product and are based on weight, volume, or the amount of the product.
The taxpayer may reduce one’s tax liability by taking part in recycling programmes for packaging, products harmful to the environment, electrical and electronic equipment and appliances, and means of transport. Taxpayers do not have an obligation to recycle themselves to be entitled to relief; instead, they can conclude an agreement with a recycler.
On some of the products, the taxpayer must also pay disposal tax at varying rates.
## Vehicle taxes
There are three vehicle taxes in Latvia, a vehicle usage tax, a light corporate vehicle tax, and a foreign-registered vehicle tax. The first is payable on the use of all vehicles (except tractors, car trailers not exceeding 3,500 kg, trams, trolleybuses, off-road vehicles, snowmobiles, mopeds, and bicycles). The second is payable on light vehicles held or owned by a company. The third is for M1 and N1 category vehicles registered abroad.
### Vehicle usage tax
Vehicle usage tax is payable annually on the use of vehicles, and it must be fully paid before the state technical inspection.
The amount of vehicle usage tax depends on the classification of vehicles according to their features under statutory provisions. The tax charge depends on various criteria, such as date of first registration, gross weight, engine volume, maximum engine power, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per kilometre, etc.
### Light corporate vehicle tax (LCVT)
LCVT is paid on vehicles owned or held (e.g. rented) by a person engaged in economic activity, which are registered for the first time after 1 January 2009 and have details of engine volume in kW on their registration certificate. There is a fixed rate of LCVT calculated according to the engine volume. The fixed monthly rates of LCVT are as follows:
LCVT on a vehicle in which, according to its construction, power from an electrical energy/power storage device (e.g. battery, capacitor, flywheel, generator) inside the vehicle is used as its only mechanical propulsion power, will be EUR 15 per month.
LCVT on a vehicle in which, according to its construction, power from an electrical energy/power storage device (e.g. battery, capacitor, flywheel, generator) inside the vehicle is used as its mechanical propulsion power and when the electrical energy can be also obtained by connecting to an external source of electricity, will be EUR 25 per month.
LCVT on vehicles not mentioned in the above criteria is EUR 60 a month.
### Foreign-registered vehicle tax
Foreign-registered vehicle tax is paid on the use of foreign-registered M1 and N1 category vehicles in Latvia. The tax is calculated according to the following formula: vehicle operation tax for the year x 1/12 x the estimated number of months during which a car will be used in road traffic in Latvia.
## Lottery and gambling tax
A lottery and gambling tax is levied on licensed organisers of games or lotteries. Licence fees range from EUR 2,000 to EUR 427,000. Game organisers, gambling places, and gambling machines are subject to gambling tax. The rates depend on the number and type of gambling machines or percentage of income for several gambling types.
## Electricity tax
Electricity tax is levied on electricity supplied to final consumers or consumed by suppliers. The rate is EUR 1.01 per MWh. Exemptions are available to producers of electricity and for electricity used by domestic public transport and households.
## Local duties
Certain activities are subject to local duties (e.g. construction permits).

## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Latvia, a country in Northern Europe, is bordered by Estonia to the north, Belarus and Lithuania to the south, the Russian Federation to the east, and the Baltic Sea to the west. Latvia is divided into 110 municipalities and nine cities, with Riga as the capital. The national language is Latvian, and the euro (EUR) has been the national currency since 1 January 2014.
The Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918. It has been continuously recognised as a sovereign state since 1920 despite occupations and rule by the Soviet Union (1940-1941, 1945-1991) and Nazi Germany (1941-1945). On 21 August 1991, Latvia declared the restoration of its *de facto* independence, re-established international diplomatic ties, and joined the United Nations (UN). Latvia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999 and became a member of the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2016.
The commercial environment is generally friendly to foreign companies, and EU directives are implemented and observed. The Latvian government has adopted modern laws establishing copyrights, patents, and trademarks and the means of enforcing their protection.
Telecommunication services are modern, and the real estate market provides modern housing and business venues. The legal system, tax structures, and trade and other regulations have been significantly modified to meet EU standards. Most EU directives have been transposed into Latvia’s national legislation.
Latvia’s economy is based on service industries, including transportation, information technology, and financial services. At the same time, the construction industry plays an important role, as well as wood, food, and light industries (e.g. textiles). Tourism is growing rapidly.
In the area of employment and wealth taxation, we advise on employment taxes and remuneration packages, national social insurance, expatriate tax services, and visa and immigration services. We also provide client training, such as tailor-made courses on the general tax system and the EU indirect taxation system (VAT and customs), as well as regular surveys of tax legislation changes.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Latvian residents are liable to Latvian income tax on their worldwide income.
Non-residents are liable to income tax on their Latvian-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
Latvia has a progressive PIT system. Unless the law provides for a different rate, the progressive rate is based on the level of annual income as follows:
The PIT rate on dividends is 25,5%. However, when a company has already applied CIT to its profits, no PIT is required on dividends paid to individuals (this exemption is not applicable to the 3% additional PIT rate as per below in case total income exceeds EUR 200,000).
This provision applies to dividends from Latvian companies, companies within the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), and other entities, except for companies from tax havens and micro-business tax (MBT) payers.
To benefit from a zero PIT rate on dividends, evidence of PIT or CIT paid abroad must generally be presented, except in the case of EU/EEA companies where such evidence is not needed as it is assumed that the tax (PIT or CIT) has been applied at the source by default. Nevertheless, in practical application, tax authorities often request confirmation of tax compliance even for dividends received from these jurisdictions.
The PIT rate for income from capital (including interest) and capital gains is 25.5%.
Starting in 2025, an additional 3% PIT rate applies to the portion of an individual's total annual income that exceeds EUR 200,000. The tax base includes taxable income, which is employment remuneration, taxable income from capital reported on the annual tax return, royalties, and taxable income from capital gains, and on a specific exempt type of income, which is dividends and dividend equivalents received by the individual.
The tax base does not include other exempt income, such as employee benefits, gifts and income from real estate if they meet the PIT Act’s exemption criteria.
The additional rate will be applied at the time of submitting the annual tax return for the previous tax year (e.g. starting from 2026 for 2025 etc.).
The Latvian PIT Act defines cryptocurrency as a capital asset subject to the general capital gains tax rules with the requirement to match capital gain with the capital loss from cryptocurrency to assess annual total gain or loss from the trading in cryptocurrency.
Other capital assets should not be matched and can be set off against each other.
The taxation regime applicable to royalties, currently in force, was not amended as of 1 July 2021 for a transitional period until the end of 2021 as it was initially planned. The taxation approach was supposed to differ for the individuals who are and are not registered as self-employed individuals. However, this special regime has been prolonged and the mentioned changes have been postponed until the end of 2027.
The individuals who are not registered as self-employed persons and payment is treated as royalties, the payer of royalties must apply 25% PIT on the gross royalties via withholding, without applying a notional expense rate.
A controlled foreign company (CFC) regime has been operative in Latvia since 1 January 2013. Income from substantial participation in a CFC located in a tax haven attracts a progressive rate of PIT.
## Micro-business tax (MBT)
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income, such as municipal taxes.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Under the new CIT model in force as of 1 January 2018, all undistributed corporate profits are exempt. This exemption covers both active (e.g. trading) and passive (e.g. dividends, interest, royalties) types of income. It also covers capital gains arising on the sale of all types of assets, including shares and securities, except for the sale of immovable property by non-residents. This tax regime is available to Latvian-resident companies and non-resident companies’ permanent establishments (PEs) registered in Latvia.
The taxation of corporate profits is postponed until those profits are distributed as dividends or deemed to be distributed.
The CIT rate is 20% applicable to the taxable base. However, before applying the statutory rate, the taxable base should be divided by a coefficient of 0.8. As the taxable base is increased by the coefficient, the effective CIT rate is 25%.
From 1 January 2024, credit institutions and consumer crediting service providers are required to pay a tax surcharge of 20% in the taxation year (regardless of the profit distribution). The tax surcharge is calculated by using the financial data of the pre-taxation year and by taking into account profits distributed and the amount of tax paid thereof in the taxation year, simultaneously providing that the tax surcharge paid is further taken into account when calculating the tax payable on the distribution of profits in dividends. CIT calculated on other tax objects (except for dividends, deemed dividends, and conditional dividends) cannot be used to reduce this tax liability.
From 1 January 2025, Latvian-registered credit institutions and branches of foreign credit institutions in Latvia will be liable to pay solidarity contributions for the next three years. The calculation of the contributions will be based on an increase in the bank’s or branch’s net interest income exceeding the average net interest income in five financial years (2018–2022) by more than 50%, multiplied by the base coefficient for solidarity contributions and applying a rate of 60%.
Profit distributions:
Deemed distributions:
For non-business expenses, a non-taxable cap on representation expenses and staff sustainability expenses is calculated as 5% of the company’s total gross wages for the past year.
A bad debt that remains unrecovered within 36 months after a provision was made for it should be added to the tax base, unless the exemption criteria are met. If a company has made provisions up to 31 December 2021 and if debtors are going through the insolvency process, the period for recovering debts could be extended to 60 months.
The CIT Act provides special provisions for provisions made under IFRS 9. The exceptional conditions a company has to meet before it can take an exemption are as follows:
However, if a provision made in this way applies to a truly bad debt the company has expensed and will not have been recovered within 60 months after it arose when the customer was supposed to pay the supplier, and the receivable is ineligible for an exemption under section 9(3) of the CIT Act, then provisions made under IFRS 9, too, will have to be added to the tax base.
For excess interest payments up to 3 million euros (EUR) only one method applies (i.e. a debt-equity ratio of 4:1). A second method (30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation [EBITDA]) is applicable if interest payments exceed EUR 3 million. Due to COVID-19, the Latvian legislation has been amended to state that excess interest payments are not subject to CIT and thin capitalisation rules are not applicable for the years 2021 and 2022.
Lending to related parties is considered a profit distribution with several exclusion (i.e. the parent’s loans to a subsidiary; short-term loans for up to 12 months; a loan not exceeding one received from an unrelated party or not exceeding a certain level of registered share capital; if the lender has no retained earnings at year-start, etc).
The definition of 'related party' includes Latvian companies with at least 20% shareholders.
From a Latvian perspective, this tax is considered a CIT, not a withholding tax (WHT), so the rate is not affected by an applicable double tax treaty (DTT).
In Latvia, resident companies are taxed on profits distributed from their worldwide income, while PEs of non-residents are taxed only on profits distributed from Latvian-source income. Other Latvian-source income derived by non-residents may be subject to a final WHT or CIT by way of assessment.
## Micro-business tax (MBT)
Only a sole trader, an individual undertaking, a farm or fishery operation, and an individual registered with the State Revenue Service (SRS) as a trader, if they are not registered for value-added tax (VAT), can become an MBT payer.
From 1 January 2024, a single MBT rate of 25% has been set, regardless of the turnover of the micro-business.
Only the shareholder of the company having MBT status will be considered an MBT payer, whereas the remuneration of the employees of such a company will be subject to payroll taxes at the standard rates.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## National social insurance contributions (NSIC)
As of 1 July 2021, a minimum NSIC object of a minimum wage (EUR 740 for 2025) has been introduced. In case an individual earns less from all NSIC taxable income sources, the employer is responsible for making the contributions on employees’ behalf.
Individuals employed by multiple employers or individuals who are both self-employed and employees must sum their total income to determine whether the income is within the minimum amount.
Since January 2014, income attracting NSIC has been capped. In 2025, the cap is EUR 105,300.
The contribution rates are summarised in this table:
| Employment | 2025 (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Employment with company registered in Latvia/EU/EEA (split rate): |  |
| Employer | 23.59 |
| Employee | 10.50 |
| Employment with company registered in Latvia/EU/EEA (employee eligible for retirement) (split rate): |  |
| Employer | 20.77 |
| Employee | 9.25 |
| Foreign national employed by foreign non-resident employer (full rate payable by either employer or employee): | 31.83 |
| Self-employed | 31.07 |
| Self-employed (eligible for retirement) | 29.36 |
NSIC should be reported and paid quarterly in the case of self-employed persons, whereas monthly contributions are required to be withheld, reported, and paid by Latvian employers.
A 10% NSIC should be contributed by self-employed individuals and payers of royalties, as follows:
## Solidarity tax (ST)
ST has been in place since 1 January 2016. ST is applicable on income that exceeds the maximum income attracting NSIC, i.e. EUR 105,300 a year in 2025, and during the year is payable at the same rate as NSIC: 23.59% for employer and 10.5% for employee. However, the effective ST rate is 25%. Thus, for the contributions made e.g. in 2025, the employer will receive ST refund by September 2026.
The ST paid will be split as follows:
The ST Act does not provide for a different split if a person’s NSIC rate is lower than the standard rate. Thus the fixed percentage points apply to all ST payers regardless of their NSIC status and rates used.
The ST payer is also required under the PIT Act to file their annual tax return between 1 April and 1 July of the following year to recalculate ST and PIT.
## Consumptions taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Latvia.
## Gift taxes
Gifts in any form from individuals are subject to the progressive PIT rate after applying an annual exemption of EUR 1,425 to the value of the gift. Gifts of up to EUR 100 (including VAT) from the employer are exempt from PIT. Gifts between spouses and relatives up to the third degree are fully exempt. Starting from 1 July 2024, the exemption also applies to gifts between persons who have registered a civil partnership.
## Light corporate vehicle tax (LCVT)

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The following types of payments to non-residents, and in certain cases under Latvian transfer pricing rules to related Latvian companies using CIT reliefs, are subject to WHT.
## Management fees
A Latvian company can rely on a DTT to reduce the rate of WHT to zero for management fees if the non-resident does not create a PE. To this end, the Latvian company must obtain a valid residence certificate for each type of payment to each recipient before filing the annual CIT return. The residence certificate for a payment of up to EUR 5,000 in a financial year does not need approval from the SRS and is valid for one year. If the payment exceeds EUR 5,000, the residence certificate must be approved by the SRS and is valid for five years.
## Disposal of real estate
A 3% WHT applies to proceeds from real estate disposals. This also applies to income arising on the disposal of shares or other participation in a Latvian or foreign-registered company or other entity if real estate in Latvia made up more than 50% of the asset value of that company, whether directly or indirectly through shareholdings in one or more other entities established in Latvia or abroad, in the period of disposal or the previous period.
## Rent of real estate located in Latvia
WHT at a 5% rate is applied to gross income received by non-residents from rent of real estate located in Latvia.
## Dividends
Dividends paid to residents of tax havens are subject to a 20% WHT.
## Interest and royalties
Interest and royalty payments attract WHT only if made to companies in tax havens. A 20% rate applies on all interest and royalty payments to tax havens.
## Option for EU/DTT country residents
In the case of management fees and real estate disposal, EU/DTT country residents may choose between a WHT charge on total fees or a 20% tax on profit, provided the non-resident can present proof of expense. The Latvian company must first withhold the applicable tax, and the non-resident may later recover tax in excess of 20% charged on profit (income less expenses) by submitting a separate tax return.
## Reporting payments to non-residents
Companies are required to notify the SRS of all amounts paid to non-residents on transactions made on or after 1 January 2017, regardless of whether the payment was subject to WHT. This is in line with the requirements of Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, which provides for automatic exchange of information on non-residents’ revenues.
Payments on which CIT must be withheld at source must be reported on or before the 20th day of the following month.
Any other payments to non-residents (even if the payer was eligible for an exemption under a DTT) must be reported to the SRS at the time of filing the CIT return for the last month of the financial year. The SRS must be notified if total payments to a non-resident exceed EUR 5,000 for the year.
## Summary of WHT rates
Please see the following table for WHT rates applicable to the payments described above:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) | Interest (1) | Royalties (1) | Management fees (3) | Disposal of real estate | Rent of real estate |
| Non-resident companies and related Latvian companies using certain CIT reliefs | 0 | 0 | 0 | 20 | 3 | 5 |
| Companies in tax havens (2) | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 |
Notes
1. No WHT, except tax-haven companies.
2. 20% WHT applies to all payments to companies located in tax havens. Goods/securities acquired at market prices are exempt.
3. Payments to residents of DTT countries are not subject to WHT, provided the non-resident does not have a PE in Latvia and a residence certificate is available.
## Tax havens
On 1 November 2024, the Council adopted the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. Currently, it lists 11 jurisdictions.
Below is an updated list of countries and territories that are considered tax havens:
| American Samoa | Guam (US) | Samoa |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anguilla | Palau | Trinidad and Tobago |
|  | Panama | US Virgin Islands |
| Fiji | Russia | Vanuatu |

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Distributable profits are measured according to financial statements drawn up in accordance with Latvian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Accounting Standards (IAS)/International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and there are no adjustments to accounting profits for tax purposes (e.g. tax depreciation/capital allowances, tax loss carryforward/carryback).
The CIT liability associated with the distribution of dividends is recorded as an expense at the time the dividends are declared, regardless of when the profits were generated or distributed.
Dividends paid by Latvian companies are generally subject to a 20% CIT (after applying the 0.8 coefficient) at the level of the distributing company.
Certain domestic and foreign taxes can also be credited against the 20% CIT charge under domestic law or DTTs.
## Deemed dividends
Deemed dividends are a part of share capital increase from retained earnings arising from 2018 onwards. They become subject to CIT once that part of share capital is reduced and distributed to the shareholders.
## Capital gains
A gain arising on the disposal of a capital asset (except real estate sold by non-residents) is treated as ordinary income and is subject to a 20% CIT when profit is distributed.
If a taxpayer has received income from the sale of direct participation shares one has held for at least 36 months, then it is possible to reduce the dividends included in the tax base by the amount of income received from the sale of shares. This exemption does not apply in case of sale of real estate company shares.
If a non-resident sells real estate (or shares in a real estate company) located in Latvia, the sale will be subject to a 3% tax on gross proceeds. Residents of an EU/European Economic Area (EEA) member state or a country that has an effective DTT with Latvia may pay a 20% tax on the resulting capital gains instead (i.e. profit less expenses).
From 1 January 2022, companies investing in a closed alternative investment fund are allowed to exclude from their tax base any income the fund earns when selling shares in a company it owns, according to amendments to the CIT Act. To qualify, the fund will have to directly hold shares in the company for at least 36 months before their disposal. There is also a requirement that the investor should be the fund’s investor for at least 36 months during the holding period.
## Dividend income
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as ordinary income and is subject to a 20% CIT only if profit is distributed.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as ordinary income and is subject to a 20% CIT only if profit is distributed.
## Foreign income
Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income. Any foreign tax paid on income included in the tax base is allowed as a credit against the CIT charged for the year. However, the credit must not exceed the Latvian tax attributable to the income taxed abroad. Any unused tax credit may be carried forward.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Tax reform
### Corporate income tax (CIT)
Latvia is regarded as offering a relatively favourable income tax regime, as due to the CIT reform, the approach to calculating CIT changed fundamentally in 2018. Under the current model, taxation of corporate profits is postponed until those profits are distributed as dividends or deemed to be distributed. Distributed profits are subject to 20% CIT (20/80 on the net amount of the profit distribution), resulting in application of an effective 25% rate.
From 2024, credit institutions and consumer crediting service providers are required to pay a tax surcharge of 20% in the taxation year (regardless of the profit distribution).
In addition to the surcharge, from 2025, Latvian-registered credit institutions and branches of foreign credit institutions in Latvia will be liable to pay solidarity contributions for the next three years.
### Availability of existing tax relief/tax attributes
Large investment relief (LIR) and reliefs for special economic zone (SEZ) and free port companies may still be claimed by reducing CIT on declared dividends.
Profits accumulated before 2018 can be utilised by declaring dividends free of CIT indefinitely.
### Exit tax and hybrid mismatches
To complete the adoption of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD), a set of rules related to exit tax and hybrid mismatches were added to the CIT Act effective as of 12 February 2020. The CIT Act was supplemented with new rules on the tax treatment of assets a taxpayer moves abroad free of charge. There also has been adopted a new section of the CIT Act laying down the tax treatment of transactions that create hybrid mismatches.
### DAC6 Directive
Latvia has implemented Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements (DAC6). The Taxes and Duties Act was amended, giving rise to the Cabinet of Ministers’ regulation concerning the Automatic Exchange of Information on Reportable Cross-Border Arrangements.
DAC6 applies to cross-border tax arrangements that are entered into by a European Union (EU) taxpayer with other entities in the European Union or non-EU countries. Such arrangements have to be reported to national tax authorities if certain criteria (hallmarks) are met.
### DAC7 Directive
Latvia has implemented Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 (DAC7) on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation to extend the EU tax transparency rules and reporting obligations to digital platforms and platform operators. Digital platforms and platform operators are required to provide information on the income of sellers using digital platforms from 2023. These rules impose a reporting obligation on digital platforms operating within and outside the European Union.
The Latvian legislation is effective from 1 January 2023. Digital platforms and platform operators had to file their first reports to the member states for 2023 by 31 January 2024.
### Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
Latvia has implemented Council Directive (EU) 2023/956 on establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism. CBAM rules apply only to EU-registered companies importing specified goods (e.g. aluminium, iron and steel, cement, hydrogen, fertiliser, and electricity) from third countries. The list of goods covered by CBAM will be gradually expanded, so importers are advised to monitor the CBAM rules.
Companies subject to CBAM were liable to file their first CBAM reports in January 2024. Up to January 2026, companies subject to CBAM will only have the reporting obligation, i.e. duty to file quarterly CBAM reports with the competent authority. As of 1 January 2025, the companies subject to CBAM should obtain authorised declarant status. An importer that fails to obtain such status may be fined or its imports prohibited. As of 1 January 2026, CBAM takes full effect and annual CBAM declarations and certificates become mandatory.

Distributable profits are measured according to financial statements drawn up in accordance with Latvian GAAP or IAS/IFRS, and there are no adjustments to accounting profits for tax purposes (e.g. tax depreciation/capital allowances, tax loss carryforward/carryback).
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific treatment for start-up expenses.
Input VAT on goods or services acquired before VAT registration is recoverable if those items are to be used for taxable suppliers.
## Non-business expenses
Non-business expenses include costs that are not directly related to commercial activities, such as:
### Representation expenses and staff sustainability expenses
Representation expenses, by definition, are expenses a taxpayer incurs to build one's prestige, entertain one's customers and suppliers, and provide meals, as well as amounts spent on low-value items intended to make the taxpayer popular.
A new concept of 'staff sustainability' events has been introduced from 2018. These are expenses a taxpayer incurs to motivate one's staff, build teams, or maintain social infrastructure.
Representation expenses and staff sustainability expenses are capped at 5% of gross wages for the past year. There is no taxable item until the cap is reached, but afterwards CIT is payable monthly.
### Fines and penalties
Any fines, contractual penalties, and statutory interest on arrears (including an increase in principal debt) that are disproportionate to the value of the underlying transaction (a penalty that exceeds the statutory interest rate of 6% per annum set by the Civil Code, and a contract penalty that exceeds 10% of the debt) or are made to a related party or one that is registered in a tax haven are considered non-business expenses and subject to CIT at the 20% rate.
## Interest expenses
Excess interest payments are considered a deemed profit distribution and subject to 20% CIT. *For further details, see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*.
## Bad debts
A bad debt that remains unrecovered within 36 months after a provision was made for it should be added to the tax base, unless the exemption criteria are met. If a company has made provisions up to 31 December 2021 and if debtors are going through the insolvency process, the period for recovering debts could be extended to 60 months.
An internal checklist can be drawn up for claiming an exemption. It is also important to ensure that accounting records are transparent, including a separate record of bad debts incurred before 2018 and an accurate record of new bad debts arising after 1 January 2018. This will allow the company to select information about the age of a provision from its accounting records and to consider claiming an exemption in the case of writing off that provision. Provisions made for a bad debt under IFRS 9 have special rules.
## Lending to related parties
Lending to related parties is treated as a profit distribution subject to a 20% CIT. This rule has been adopted as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent taxpayers who want to pay a dividend from making a loan instead, which is essentially a hidden dividend.
The law lays down criteria for loans that are not treated as a profit distribution, such as a short-term loan maturing in up to 12 months or one that does not exceed the amount borrowed from an unrelated party. It is therefore necessary to revise the conditions for cash movements between related companies and define internal criteria for recording related-party loans by keeping a separate record of loans that are deemed distributions and on which CIT has been paid.
When repaying a loan that was included in the tax base for a past tax period, any repaid amount of the loan can be used to reduce the tax applicable base for the current tax period.
## Donations
Donations exceeding the statutory criteria are taxable. Donations paid to charitable institutions, non-profit making foundations, churches, monasteries, and various other welfare institutions may qualify for tax relief if certain criteria are met (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
## Luxury vehicles
All costs associated with luxury vehicles are considered non-business expenses and subject to a 20% CIT. A car is considered a luxury vehicle if its value exceeds EUR 50,000 (excluding VAT), and for a car that is acquired after 1 June 2023, the threshold is EUR 75,000 (excluding VAT). However, these rules do not apply to special purpose vehicles (such as emergency vehicles and special passenger vehicles).
As of 1 January 2024, changes regarding treatment of luxury vehicles expenses have been implemented in the CIT Act. After a period of 60 months that is counted from the date the vehicle is registered in a taxable person’s ownership or possession, the owner or possessor of the luxury vehicle is permitted to treat its fuel and running costs as business expenses, i.e. the general CIT rules should be applied.
## Provisions
Under the new CIT model, any movement of provisions in accounting records after 2017 will no longer affect the tax base.
Special clauses of the transition rules should be followed in order to write off any provisions on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 that have been added to taxable income in past tax periods.
Any provisions on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 to be reduced after 2017 can be deducted from the tax base and attract a coefficient of 0.75, subject to the following conditions:
In respect to provisions recognised in the financial year 2017 exceeding provisions recognised in the financial year 2016, any reduction in these provisions can be deducted only from dividends or deemed dividends included in the tax base.
Accordingly, the transition rules do not restrict the period for reducing the tax base, but they do restrict the tax base a company can reduce, in certain cases, to dividends paid. The administrative burden will also increase considerably, given the transitional obligation to separately record provisions recognised before 2018 and after 2017, as well as provisions recognised in the financial year 2017.
## Net operating losses
There is no such concept as a tax loss under the new CIT model.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Any payments to foreign affiliates that are not arm’s length may be considered a profit distribution and subject to a 20% CIT.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Group consolidation is not permitted for tax purposes.
## Transfer pricing
### Arm’s-length principle
In line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, and the CIT Act adopted as part of Latvia’s tax reform in 2018, Latvian law requires related-party transactions to be at arm’s length. In other words, the conditions made or imposed between two related enterprises in their commercial or financial relations must not differ from those that would be agreed between independent enterprises engaging in similar transactions under similar circumstances. The difference between the transfer price and the market price is treated as deemed profit distribution that is taxable at 20% CIT (25% effective).
A tax audit may examine and adjust the price of a transaction in the following circumstances:
### Transfer pricing adjustments
If a taxpayer is unable to demonstrate that the price of a controlled transaction is at arm’s-length, it is liable to make transfer pricing adjustments affecting the amount of CIT due under Latvian law. The taxable base must be adjusted in line with section 4(2)(2)(e) of the CIT Act if the taxpayer incurs higher expenses or receives lower income within the controlled transaction. Retrospective negative (downward) transfer pricing adjustment is not included in the Latvian transfer pricing regulation; as such, it is possible only as a dispute resolution tool through a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) based on DTTs.
With respect to transfer pricing adjustment, it is recommended to perform it via price adjustment during the financial year, as there is a risk of the SRS classifying the profit adjustment (transfer of residual profit) to a foreign related party as a deemed profit distribution. For better understanding, under the new CIT model in force as of 1 January 2018, the taxation of corporate profits is postponed until those profits are distributed as dividends or deemed to be distributed. The deemed profit distribution includes taxable objects of various nature, as well as transfer pricing adjustments. The taxable objects that may be classified as deemed profit distribution trigger the effective CIT of 25%.
We note that, in line with the local practice, if the parties have agreed to reduce or increase the price for the goods or services supplied earlier during the financial year, a credit note must be issued, specifying the goods or services whose value is being adjusted. Furthermore, the agreed price of goods or services supplied may be adjusted if the parties have agreed on this based on objective reasons, for instance, changes in functions, a substantial rise, or additional costs incurred in the provision of services. The SRS has indicated that in order for it to agree with the price adjustment, the taxpayer should provide sufficient proof for the increase in the cost base as well as confirmation that the result after the price adjustment falls within the arm’s-length range.
There is a general requirement to report the total amount of:
If a taxpayer believes that a transfer pricing adjustment is relevant, the difference between the transfer price and the market price must be reported on the CIT return (line 6.5) for the last tax period of the financial year; consequently, paying CIT becomes a must in that month.
The SRS has the authority to examine the taxpayer’s transfer pricing policy. If the taxpayer does not have documentary evidence to show that one's transfer prices are at arm’s-length, the SRS may challenge this during an audit. In that case, the SRS will make an adjustment and assess an additional CIT liability.
### Mandatory transfer pricing documentation
According to the new transfer pricing regulation covering financial years starting from 1 January 2018, the transfer pricing documentation elements consists of:
It is important to note that the Master file must be prepared in the Latvian or English language. If the Master file is in English, the SRS may request to see a Latvian translation of all or parts of the documentation.
The Local file must be prepared in the Latvian language.
#### Country-by-country (CbC) report
A taxpayer within a multinational enterprise group is required to file a CbC report with the SRS 12 months after the end of the financial year or to notify the SRS of the group company filing the CbC report and of its tax residence by the end of the financial year starting with financial year 2016. Conditions that necessitate the filing and notification of the filing, as well as related matters, are determined by the Cabinet of Ministers.
##### Who is required to prepare and file the CbC report?
Under the Cabinet Regulation, the CbC report filing requirement applies to a Latvian taxpayer who is part of a multinational group with total consolidated revenues exceeding EUR 750 million for the financial year and meets one of the following criteria:
##### The deadline for filing the CbC report with the SRS
A Latvian taxpayer meeting the filing criteria is required to file the CbC report within 12 months after the last day of the financial year. The first financial year for CbC report purposes began on 1 January 2016, and so the Latvian taxpayer’s CbC report for the financial year 2016 was due by 31 December 2017.
The Latvian taxpayer is also required to notify the SRS by the last day of the financial year about whether one is the parent, surrogate parent, or entity required to prepare the CbC report. A Latvian taxpayer who is not required to file the CbC report should notify the SRS of the identity and tax residence of the entity filing the CbC report.
##### Penalties in case of non-timely or incomplete or incorrect filing
The SRS has the right to impose a penalty of up to 1% of the taxpayer’s annual turnover in the financial period (capped at EUR 3,200) if the taxpayer has failed to submit the CbC report within the time limit or has not complied with the procedures for the preparation and submission of the aforementioned report.
#### Master and Local files in Latvia
The amendments introduce mandatory submission of Master and Local file for financial years starting from 1 January 2018 to the Latvian tax authorities within 12 months after the financial year-end if certain transaction amount threshold(s) set out in the regulation are met. Moreover, significant penalties will also apply in case of late submission and/or non-compliance with the transfer pricing regulation.
According to Latvian transfer pricing regulations, if a taxpayer, resident, or PE enters into a transaction with a:
then the requirements may apply, and one should look at the amount of the transaction.
##### Local file submission requirements
| Local file submission requirements | | Partner of the transaction | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No. 1Related foreign | No. 2Related private individual | No. 3Entity established in offshore country | No. 4Related resident\* |
| Amount of the controlled transaction (ACT) | ACT\*\*< EUR 250,000 | Not required to submit | | | |
| EUR 250,000 < ACT < EUR 5 million | Required to prepare within 12 months after the end of the financial year and submit within one month upon request | | | Required to prepare and to submit within 90 days upon request with opportunity to prolong the term for 30 days |
| ACT > EUR 5 million | Required to prepare and submit within 12 months after the end of the financial year | | |
\* The transaction has economic relation to the transaction with a related foreign entity or with an entity registered in a tax haven.
\*\* Total absolute amount of the incoming and outgoing related-party transactions within the financial year (i.e. goods purchased + goods sold + services received + services rendered + loan received or issued\*\*\*).
\*\*\* The SRS has issued a special explanation on the determination of ACT for loan transactions, which is included in its prepared methodological material, '*Transfertcenu dokumentācija*'. According to the information provided in the methodological material, when determining the compliance of the transfer price with the arm’s-length principle in loan transactions, not only the loan interest payments shall be assessed, but also the amount lent, as it is one of the factors significantly affecting the transaction price. Thus, with respect to the determination of ACT for different types of loan transactions, the SRS explains that:
While for the purpose to determine the ACT and, consequently, the taxpayer's obligation to prepare transfer pricing documentation, all controlled transactions performed with No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 are counted together, only material transactions (that are above EUR 20,000 for a year) should be documented.
##### Master file submission requirements
| Master file submission requirements | | Partner of the transaction | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No. 1Related foreign | No. 2Related private individual | No. 3Entity established in offshore country | No. 4Related resident\* |
| Amount of the controlled transaction (ACT) | ACT\*\* < EUR 5 million | Not required to submit | | | |
| EUR 5 million < ACT < EUR 15 million, and turnover < EUR 50 million | Required to prepare within 12 months after the end of the financial year and submit within one month upon request | | | Not required to submit |
| EUR 5 million < ACT < EUR 15 million, and turnover > EUR 50 million | Required to submit within 12 months after the end of the financial year | | |
| ACT > EUR 15 million |
\* The transaction has economic relation to the transaction with a related foreign entity or with an entity registered in a tax haven.
\*\* Total absolute amount of the incoming and outgoing related-party transactions within the financial year (i.e. goods purchased + goods sold + services received + services rendered + loan received or issued\*\*\*).
\*\*\* The SRS has issued a special explanation on the determination of ACT for loan transactions, which is included in its prepared methodological material, '*Transfertcenu dokumentācija*'. According to the information provided in the methodological material, when determining the compliance of the transfer price with the arm’s-length principle in loan transactions, not only the loan interest payments shall be assessed, but also the amount lent, as it is one of the factors significantly affecting the transaction price. Thus, with respect to the determination of ACT for different types of loan transactions, the SRS explains that:
While for the purpose to determine the ACT and, consequently, the taxpayer's obligation to prepare transfer pricing documentation, all controlled transactions performed with No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 are counted together, only material transactions (that are above EUR 20,000 for a year) should be documented.
Specific requirements to the content of the Local and Master files are outlined in the Cabinet of Ministers rules No. 802 and are aligned with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, 2022.
##### Penalties for late submission and non-compliance with the requirements for preparation of transfer pricing documentation
The new law introduced penalties for late submission and non-compliance with the requirements for preparation of transfer pricing documentation at the amount of 1% from the controlled transaction amount but not exceeding EUR 100,000.
The local law does not permit the SRS to extend the statutory filing deadline of transfer pricing documentations, so missing it poses a risk that the SRS will exercise its power to charge a penalty for failure to file transfer pricing documentation on time.
In September 2023, Latvian tax authorities published new guidelines on charging fines for transfer pricing documentation breaches. The guidelines aim to drive uniform administrative practices and provide a common understanding of the statutory criteria for charging fines and achieving proportionality, as well as to avoid charging an identical fine for breaches of different significance.
The guidelines classify transfer pricing breaches as material, less material, and immaterial (*[please see the visual](https://mindlink.lv/uploads/Breach_classifier.png)*).
The guidelines provide that the SRS will determine the amount of a fine according to the breach and the taxpayer’s individual assessment (*[please see the visual](https://mindlink.lv/uploads/Material_immaterial_breach_1.png)*).
If two or more breaches (immaterial, less material, or material) are detected for the financial period, the SRS will assess each breach on its merits and charge a fine for each separately. The guidelines state that the total fine for all breaches charged by the SRS will not exceed EUR 100,000.
Note that the above-mentioned information highlights the main points of the amendments. The changes in the transfer pricing regulations include other specific matters and nuances that have to be taken into account and carefully evaluated by the taxpayers.
#### Simplified transfer pricing documentation
The amendments in the Tax and Duty Act introduced on 28 November 2018 and information in Cabinet of Ministers Regulations on 18 December 2018 No. 802 permit a taxpayer not to prepare a simplified transfer pricing file for low-value adding services. The taxpayer should prepare a simplified transfer pricing file within 12 months after the end of the financial year and submit it to the SRS within a month after receiving a request. The Cabinet of Ministers prescribe criteria that should be met to qualify for the simplified arm’s-length pricing and documentation as well as details the taxpayer should include in the simplified transfer pricing file.
### Requirements for preparing and filing simplified transfer pricing documentation
If a taxpayer (resident or PE) enters into a transaction with a:
and the total amount of the related party transactions within the financial year exceeded EUR 250,000, then instead of a Local file the taxpayer may prepare the simplified transfer pricing documentation about transactions to which the simplified approach applies.
In accordance with the Government Regulation 677 paragraph 18.2, services are classified as low-value-adding and could be documented within simplified transfer pricing documentation if they adhere to the following criteria:
If the above criteria have been met, the application of a mark-up of 5% may be appropriate from a tax perspective and a simplified documentation (without separate benchmarking analysis) may be sufficient for transfer pricing compliance purposes.
### Advance pricing
Latvian taxpayers can apply to the SRS for an Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) regulated by the Cabinet of Ministers Regulation No. 802. The APA is an administrative instrument issued by the SRS to address a taxpayer’s request for establishing transfer pricing conditions and methodology in one’s related-party transactions for a maximum period of five years for both future periods and previous years.
This option is available to companies whose annual transactions with foreign related parties are expected to exceed EUR 1,430,000.
An APA application fee of EUR 7,114 is payable to the SRS as follows:
If the SRS refuses to initiate an APA with the taxpayer, the SRS reserves the right not to refund the 20% down payment.
The rules governing the application of the CIT Act state that the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations may be used for Latvian transfer pricing purposes.
### Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)
Latvian taxpayers can initiate the MAP governed by the Taxes and Duties Act in order to solve international double taxation disputes. The SRS has put together Guidance on the Elimination of Double Taxation of Profits and Capital of Enterprises and Guidance on Dispute Resolution under the Mutual Agreement Procedure with Non-EU Countries. Detailed information is also provided in the MAP profile prepared by the OECD.
### Public CbC report
The Law on Income and Income Tax Disclosure in force from 11 October 2023 introduces a Public Country-by-Country Report of Multinational Enterprise Group (public CbC report) that requires certain Latvian-registered parent companies and subsidiaries of multinational enterprise (MNE) groups to prepare, file, and publish a report on revenues, income taxes, and business operations in the residence country of each group company and by tax jurisdiction. The new rules apply, meaning the public CbC report has to be published for the financial years beginning on 22 June 2024 or later. The public CbC report must be filed by the parent company, subsidiaries, and branches in the EDS of the SRS and posted on the parent company’s website if the group’s total consolidated revenue at the ultimate holding company’s balance sheet date exceeds EUR 750 million for two consecutive financial years. The public CbC report must be filed and published no later than 12 months after the date of the balance sheet for the financial year.
It’s important to add that unlike the non-public CbC report rules that are currently in force, Latvian subsidiaries and branches will have to file the public CbC report along with the parent company. The only exception is subsidiaries that are not medium or large companies under section 5(4–5) of the Company and Consolidated Accounts Act and branches with revenues below EUR 8 million.
The new Act makes it possible to waive particular disclosure requirements for a certain period. One or more particular items of information may be excluded temporarily from the public CbC report if disclosing those items is likely to seriously harm the commercial interests of the entities covered by the report. Yet it’s important to remember that any unpublished information will have to be included in the report no later than five years after its initial suppression.
The public CbC report rules imply that nearly all Latvian companies and foreign company branches that are currently posting statements on the EDS about submission of the CbC report prepared by the group’s parent company in its residence country will have to not only report but also translate and file this report on the EDS. The SRS will then have five working days to pass this report for publication on the official website of the Latvian Company Register Lursoft.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules apply to interest payments exceeding a specified amount.
Only one method is available for interest payments of up to EUR 3 million: a debt-to-equity ratio of 4:1 (interest in proportion to the excess of the average liability over an amount equal to four times shareholders’ equity at the beginning of the tax year less any revaluation reserve).
A second method (30% of EBITDA) is available for interest payments exceeding EUR 3 million. Applying this method, a company can calculate net interest (i.e. the difference between interest payments and interest revenues [if any]).
The higher amount of interest that exceeds these calculations should be added to the tax base.
The following interest payments are exempt from thin capitalisation rules:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
A CFC regime currently applies to individual shareholders; *for more information, please see Latvia’s [Individual tax summary](../individual/significant-developments.html).*
The CIT Act prescribes that a Latvian company owning a substantial share in a foreign company (owning more than 50% of a foreign company's shares directly or indirectly or being entitled to more than 50% of its profit) should pay CIT on profit in proportion to that share if the foreign company is a non-genuine (artificial) arrangement established to obtain CIT advantage and no substantial business is carried on by the CFC. If these criteria are met, then any profit made by a CFC that is based or incorporated in a tax haven is taxable in Latvia from the first eurocent, while a CFC registered elsewhere will not attract CIT unless its profits reach EUR 750,000 and passive income exceeds EUR 75,000.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
In general, branches and resident companies are taxed alike (i.e. taxation of corporate profits is postponed until profit distribution). As with companies, a PE's taxable base is a sum of taxable items consisting of profit distributions and deemed distributions. However, the PE's taxable base consists not only of taxable items incurred directly through the PE but also of any taxable items the non-resident allocates to the PE. Since technically branches and PEs cannot pay dividends, this fact makes it more difficult to determine what forms the taxable base for a PE or branch.
The PE's taxable base includes items in cash or otherwise that are extracted from the PE, including profit distributions and deemed distributions. These items include the following:
The following expenses would be excluded from the PE's taxable base:
Accordingly, the PE's taxable profit is significantly affected by keeping separate books and holding documentary evidence for the type of expenditure concerned (cost of goods sold, expenses related to the PE's business activity, or non-business expenses).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Any foreign tax paid on income included in the tax base is allowed as a credit against the CIT charged on dividends for the year. However, the credit must not exceed the Latvian tax attributable to the income taxed abroad and must be confirmed by the foreign tax authority. Any unused tax credit may be carried forward.
## Donations to public benefit organisations
Donation relief is available on donations to Latvian public benefit organisations or their equivalents in an EU/EEA member state or a country that has an effective DTT with Latvia. The donor can take relief on one's total donations by using one of the following three methods:
1. Exclude donations from the tax base at up to 5% of profit after taxes for the past year.
2. Exclude donations from the tax base at up to 2% of total gross wages on which NSIC were paid in the past year.
3. Reduce the CIT charge on dividends by 85% of the donated amount, capped at 30% of the CIT charge on dividends.
Donations to public benefit organisations are not considered non-business expenses if the company has chosen method 1 or 2 and does not exceed mentioned limits.
## Large investment relief (LIR)
No new LIRs are granted after 2017. According to transition rules, LIR may still be claimed by reducing CIT on declared dividends for LIR applications filed before 2018.
## Free ports and special economic zones (SEZs)
Companies operating in a free port or SEZ are entitled to CIT and RET relief. These areas include the free ports of Ventspils and Riga and the SEZs of Rezekne, Latgale, and Liepaja.
Qualifying companies may claim CIT relief of up to 80% of the CIT charged on dividends.
RET relief amounts to 80%. In addition, a municipality that issues binding rules has the power to reduce the percentage amount of an RET relief to 10% of the tax charge (without applying any other rebates).
Municipalities are to publish their binding rules for the coming tax year by 1 November. Thus, each free port and SEZ municipality will be able to decide about an RET rebate to apply in the coming year according to its budgetary projections.
Total CIT and RET relief a company can claim depends on the amount of qualifying investment it has made in the free port or SEZ area. Depending on the size of the company, the total available tax relief ranges from 35% to 55% of the amount invested.
## Deferred tax
The new CIT rules have cancelled all temporary differences between the financial accounting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities from 1 January 2018. With temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities in financial accounting and for tax purposes ceasing to exist from that date, no deferred tax asset will be realised or deferred tax liability settled after 2017. Hence, deferred tax assets or liabilities are no longer recognised on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017.
After the new CIT rules were introduced on 1 January 2018, the tax incentive for deductibility of R&D costs was cancelled.

# Latvia
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Pillar II
Latvia’s Ministry of Finance had finalised a draft legislation for partially implementing the Pillar II global minimum tax (GloBE) rules as per Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 of 14 December 2022.
The partial implementation introduces certain related reporting requirements but excludes the income inclusion rule and undertaxed payment/profit rule because Latvia has decided to postpone the enforcement of these laws until 31 December 2029.
## DAC6 Directive
The aim of DAC6 is to ensure transparency and fairness in taxation, as well as to counter tax avoidance. Failure to comply with DAC6 could mean facing sanctions under local law in EU countries and reputational risks for businesses, individuals, and intermediaries.
Latvia has implemented Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements (DAC6). The Taxes and Duties Act was amended, giving rise to the Cabinet of Ministers’ regulation concerning the Automatic Exchange of Information on Reportable Cross-Border Arrangements.
DAC6 applies to cross-border tax arrangements that are entered into by an EU taxpayer with other entities in the European Union or non-EU countries and provides for reporting of the arrangement to the tax authorities if certain hallmarks are met.
The Latvian legislation is effective from 1 July 2020, and reports retroactively cover arrangements implemented between 25 June 2018 and 1 July 2020.
It is required to file information with the national tax authority within 30 days of the first of the following dates:
Under DAC6, an arrangement is reportable if:
The scope of taxes covered under the Latvian legislation is fully lined up with DAC6 and applies to all taxes except NSIC, VAT, customs duties, and excise duties.
Under DAC6, cross-border arrangements are defined as arrangements concerning more than one EU member state or an EU member state and a third country. The hallmarks can be distinguished as hallmarks that are subject to the main benefit test (MBT) and those that cause a reporting obligation without being subject to the MBT.
Cabinet Regulation on Latvian Mandatory Disclosure Rules provide the same definition with respect to reportable cross-border arrangements as the DAC6 Directive. In line with the Directive, the Latvian MDR legislation does not apply to domestic arrangements.
## DAC7 Directive
Latvia has implemented Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 (DAC7) on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation to extend the EU tax transparency rules and reporting obligations to digital platforms and platform operators. Digital platforms and platform operators are required to provide information on the income of sellers using digital platforms from 2023. These rules impose a reporting obligation on digital platforms operating within and outside the European Union.
The Latvian legislation is effective from 1 January 2023. Digital platforms and platform operators have to file their reports to the member states for 2024 by 31 January 2025.
To secure the enforcement of reporting rules and to ease the administrative burden on digital platforms, the reporting obligation will apply to cross-border, as well as domestic, transactions.
The DAC7 reporting obligation will cover the following activities:
Digital platforms that only process payments, record or advertise goods/services, and redirect/forward users will be exempt from the reporting obligation. The exemption will also cover platform operators for one-off sellers of goods (up to 30 sales with annual fees of up to EUR 2,000) and for rental agreements of companies, such as hotel chains or travel organisers, that have provided more than 2,000 rental agreements through the platform in a tax period.
## Implementation of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) provisions
Following the OECD initiative, Council Directive (EU) 2016/881 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation was introduced on 25 May 2016. Under the directive, Latvia is a part of the mandatory automatic exchange of information (AEOI) mechanism in the field of taxation and has implemented the CbC report by adopting the Cabinet of Ministers’ Regulation No. 397 of 4 July 2017.
Latvia has transposed the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) as well as Council Directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation, into domestic law. Latvian financial institutions covered by the CRS must report certain income and asset information on certain non-resident account holders to the Latvian tax authorities.
While drafting the new CIT Act, Latvia already transposed some of the rules of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (ATAD 1 and 2) (i.e. limitations on the deductibility of interest, a general anti-abuse rule, rules to tackle hybrid mismatches).
## Limitations on the deductibility of interest
The CIT Act fully transposes the interest limitation rule prescribed by ATAD. In other words, where a taxpayer’s interest expenses for the financial year exceed EUR 3 million on borrowings or finance leases from parties that are not credit institutions (financial institutions) of Latvia, the EEA, or a country that has an effective DTT with Latvia, the CIT base should include any interest charges over and above 30% of the taxpayer’s EBITDA.
## A general anti-abuse rule
Under the Latvian CIT Act, flow-through dividends are not exempt from CIT where the taxpayer’s main intention, or the main reason a related party was set up or exists, or the main purpose of the transaction, was to claim a tax exemption on dividends available under the CIT Act or the PIT Act.
## Rules to tackle hybrid mismatches
Provisions of the Latvian CIT Act require the taxpayer to neutralise the consequences of a hybrid mismatch by increasing the tax base. It is proposed to have a secondary adjustment as well as a primary one (a secondary adjustment will be made when the other party to the transaction, who is not an EU member state and has not adopted measures for neutralising hybrid mismatches, fails to make a primary adjustment).
In order to neutralise a double deduction, provisions of the CIT Act prescribe that if both countries involved in the transaction are EU member states, the payee has to increase the tax base by an appropriate amount deducted under the law of the payor’s country. If the other party is in a non-EU country, the EU company will have to resolve the hybrid mismatch regardless of the payor’s/payee’s status.
To neutralise a deduction without inclusion, the onus of increasing the tax base should lie with the payor if the parties are EU-registered companies. If the payor is established in a non-EU country, the EU payee will have to ensure the payment is properly included in taxable income.
Special rules govern a chain of transactions where the EU company technically does not create a hybrid mismatch, but assessing that chain leads to the conclusion that a hybrid mismatch arises in the non-EU country, i.e. the payment received and included in the tax base is offset by another payment for that transaction in the non-EU country, which creates a double deduction. The EU taxpayer should eliminate this by adding to the tax base the deduction taken in the non-EU country for offsetting the hybrid mismatch.
Provisions of the CIT Act also place the taxpayer under an obligation to increase the tax base by the income of an unrecognised foreign PE, with separate rules for transparent (hybrid) units.
A hybrid mismatch itself results in a deemed profit distribution that should be included in the tax return for the last tax period of the financial year.
## Exit tax
Latvia has completed the adoption of the ATAD 1 provisions. New rules on the tax treatment of assets a taxpayer moves abroad free of charge have been included in the CIT Act. The tax base is to exclude any assets a taxpayer moves to a foreign country free of charge and makes them available for a period of up to 12 months:
## EU state aid investigations
Latvian law provides the necessary references to EC Regulation No. 651/2014, which ensures that the EU funding intensity complies with EU rules for state aid. Currently, there are no investigations on the part of the European Commission with regard to Latvian tax law.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs) and intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
Latvia has effective DTTs with 63 countries and continues developing its tax treaty network. Latvia has signed the OECD's Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.
Latvia has also signed an IGA with the United States (US) government to implement the tax reporting and withholding procedures associated with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). On 2 April 2014, the US Treasury announced that the IGA was ‘in effect’ and, on 27 June 2014, the US Treasury and Latvia signed and released the IGA.

# Latvia
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Residents are entitled to relief from double taxation under national legislation and effective tax treaties.
Generally, foreign tax paid on income included in the tax base is allowed as a credit against PIT on the basis of documentary evidence of income earned and income tax paid approved by the foreign tax authorities. The tax credit should not exceed the Latvian tax attributable to the income earned abroad.
According to the national legislation, PIT is not applicable on employment income derived and taxed in another EU/EEA member state or in a country that has an effective double tax treaty (DTT) with Latvia. Foreign employment income not taxed attracts Latvian PIT at the progressive rates.
## Tax treaties
Latvia has effective DTTs with 63 countries and continues developing its tax treaty network.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
From January 1, 2025, a package of changes to the application of personal income tax (PIT) has been implemented in Latvia. The main changes include revised PIT rates, a single fixed personal allowance replacing the income-differentiated personal allowance, and an additional 3% PIT rate on the portion of total annual income exceeding EUR 200,000, among other relevant adjustments.
The special royalties regime has been extended until the end of 2027. Under this regime, individuals who are not registered as self-employed and receive payments classified as royalties will continue having 25% withheld from their gross royalties by the payer.
- A 25.5% PIT on income of up to EUR 105,300 per year.
- A 33% PIT on income above EUR 105,300 per year.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Employment income
### Monthly application of PIT by the employer
Employers are required to apply PIT rates according to monthly income thresholds, calculated by dividing the annual income thresholds by 12 as follows:
| The employee pays Latvian NSIC. | The employer applies a 25.5% PIT on monthly gross income of up to EUR 8,775. | The employer applies the PIT rate of 25.5% on income exceeding EUR 8,775 and does not apply the 33% PIT. Tax rate difference is then covered by the part of Solidarity tax. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The employee holds a foreign A1 certificate, and does not pay Latvian NSIC. | The employer applies a 25.5% PIT to monthly gross income of up to EUR 8,775. | The employer applies a 33% PIT on the excess of EUR 8,775. |
### Application of PIT by individuals annually
A person whose annual income exceeds EUR 105,300 (in 2025) is required to file the annual income tax return. Mandatory filing also applies to individuals who are self-employed or need to pay additional PIT. An individual may voluntarily file a tax return to request a refund of overpaid taxes. Latvian tax authorities have introduced an automated solution for refund of overpaid PIT that came into effect on 1 January 2023 for individuals who have not filed their tax returns if certain criteria are met. Automated refund of overpaid PIT will occur only in specific cases.
Individuals are required to apply progressive PIT rates on their taxable income. In assessing the applicable rates, the entire taxable income, including applicable flat tax rates, should be counted.
From 2025, the portion of individuals’ total annual income that exceeds EUR 200,000 is subject to an additional 3% PIT rate. The rate is applicable at the time of submitting the annual tax return for the previous tax year (e.g. starting from 2026 for 2025 etc.) (for more information see section *Personal income tax rates*).
For persons who pay Latvian NSIC and ST on their full income, applying the rate of 33% through the annual income tax return is a formal procedure to compensate them for the additional PIT charge at the expense of ST already paid. Consequently, the effective rate of PIT for persons paying ST on their full income is still 25.5%. Otherwise, individuals not paying NSIC and ST on their entire income are affected, since they are required to pay additional tax.
### Allowances and a fixed personal allowance (FPA)
In 2025, an income-differentiated personal allowance is cancelled, and the employer is required to apply a fixed personal allowance (FPA) of 510 EUR regardless of their income level.
For PIT purposes, the employer is still permitted to deduct the employee part of NSIC.
If a wage tax book is submitted via the Electronic Declaration System (EDS), a monthly dependent allowance of EUR 250 can be claimed for each dependent in 2025.
In addition, a person with a recognized disability is entitled to additional tax relief as follows:
A person recognized as politically repressed or as a member of the national resistance movement is entitled to additional tax relief of EUR 1,848 per year or EUR 154 per month.
## Equity compensation
The PIT Act exempts any income arising on the exercise of stock options, provided the criteria below are met.
The exercise of stock options must take place no later than six months after the termination of the employment relationship between the employee and the company in order to apply the beneficial regime.
If, at the time of exercising stock options, the individual does not have an employment contract with the entity that granted them or with a related entity (e.g. the individual is a leaver), the employer should pay NSIC out of their own pocket at the rate applicable when the employment ended.
## Business income
When calculating taxable operating income, business expenses can be written off as operating expenses.
The taxpayer’s operating loss can be offset in chronological order against taxable operating income in the next three tax years.
## Capital gains
Capital gains arising from the disposal of capital assets are taxed at 25.5%. Capital assets include real estate, shares, investment fund certificates, debentures, and intellectual property.
However, income from transactions with capital assets that have been initiated but not completed by December 31, 2024, will be subject to the PIT rate of 20% in 2025, 2026, and 2027 (it required submission of the special notification form to the SRS by the end of 2024).
### Real estate
Latvian tax residents (individuals) and non-residents can apply an exemption on income arising on the disposal of real estate in Latvia if:
## Dividend and interest income
Dividend income, interest income, alienation of bonds, and income from life insurance contracts and private pension funds is taxed at 25.5%. This type of income should still be reported and charged to PIT through the annual income tax return unless such income is paid by a Latvian taxpayer who has already withheld PIT at source.
A 0% PIT applies on dividends paid by a Latvian/EU/EEA company or one from any other country if there is evidence that CIT or PIT has been withheld at source.
In any case, dividends received from tax havens will attract a 25.5% PIT. Dividends that are paid by MBT payers from profit that has been subject to CIT after 1 January 2021 would be subject to 0% PIT; otherwise, 25.5%.
From 2025, dividends would still be included in the tax base for the additional 3% PIT rate if an individual’s total income exceeds EUR 200,000 per year.
## Income from substantial participation in controlled foreign entities
Income from a substantial participation in controlled foreign entities is subject to a progressive PIT rate. This applies to Latvian tax residents that directly or indirectly hold at least 25% of a foreign entity’s equity, stock, or voting power, or are in any other manner (e.g. by contract) entitled to a substantial proportion of distributed profits or in a position to influence decisions about the foreign entity’s profit distribution policy. An exception applies to a participation in such foreign entities through a public company that is listed on an EU/EEA regulated market.
