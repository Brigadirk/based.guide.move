## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is assessable on the sales value of products (e.g. raw materials, produce, finished or partly finished merchandise) with few exemptions, most services (e.g. construction, utilities, professional and personal services not derived from employment, rental), and on import of goods and services. The VAT rate is 21%, although certain specific items are subject to a 27% or 10.5% rate. VAT is payable by filing monthly tax returns.
The increased rate of 27% applies to ‘utilities services’ (e.g. telecommunications, household gas, running water, sewerage, and energy) not rendered to dwelling-purposes real estate.
A reduced rate of 10.5% applies to certain transactions, including (but not limited to) the following:
VAT paid on purchases, final imports, and rental of automobiles not considered as inventory cannot be computed by the purchaser as a VAT credit. The same tax treatment applies to other services, such as those provided by restaurants, hotels, and garages.
### VAT exemptions
Among others, the following transactions are exempt from VAT:
### VAT exemption on importation
The following import transactions are also exempted from VAT:
### VAT export reimbursement regime
Exports of goods and services are treated as zero-rated transactions. Nevertheless, input VAT related to these transactions can either be used as a credit against output VAT or refunded pursuant to a special procedure.
Services rendered within the country shall be deemed to be exports if they are effectively applied or economically utilised outside the country.
Exporters must file an export return with the tax authorities, reporting the VAT receivables related to their exports to be reimbursed on VAT paid in relation to the export operations. A report certified by a public accountant with respect to the value, registrations, and other characteristics related to the refund must be attached to the export return.
The tax credit related to exports and other taxable activities can only be refunded in proportion to the exports, and can be fully refunded to a cap of 21% of the freight on board (FOB) value of the exported products.
There is no specific method stated in the legislation for allocating the tax credit related to exports, but taxpayers are able to use any methods of calculation that would be suitable to their business model. This calculation has to be approved by the tax authorities.
Finally, it is important to highlight that the tax authorities have to approve the tax credit to be refunded.
### VAT reimbursement on investments in infrastructure projects and acquisition of capital goods
An expedient VAT recovery mechanism for VAT credit balances on certain infrastructure and investments in capital goods is available, to the extent that companies have not been able to recover the VAT within six months.
### Electronic invoicing
All VAT-registered taxpayers are compelled to use electronic invoices. In order to apply for this regime, an authorisation must be obtained from the tax authorities. As a result, the tax authorities will assign an Electronic Authorization Code (*Código de Autorización Electrónico* or CAE), which is included in every issued electronic invoice.
## Import and export duties
The levels of import duty currently range between 0% and 35%, except in cases where a specific minimum duty is applied or that involve merchandise with a specific treatment. These percentages were established considering the individual competitive conditions prevailing in different production sectors and the relative advantages of contributing to the introduction of equipment and technology for local industry. In general, merchandise originating from Latin America Integration Association (LAIA) countries is entitled to preferential duty.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is assessable on a wide variety of items sold in Argentina (not on exports), principally on tobacco, wines, soft drinks, spirits, gasoline, lubricants, insurance premiums, automobile tyres, mobiles services, perfumes, jewellery, and precious stones. The bases of the assessment and tax rate of some items are as follows:
| Products | Nominal rates (%) |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes | 20/25/70 |
| Alcoholic drinks | 20/26 |  |  |
| Beers | 8/14 |  |  |
| Soft drinks | 4/8/10 |  |  |
| Jewellery and precious stones | 20 |  |  |
| Certain electronic devices and appliances | 9.5/19 |  |  |
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is levied by each of the 24 jurisdictions into which Argentina is divided, and applies principally to contracts and agreements, deeds, mortgages, and other obligations, agreements, and discharges of a civil, financial, or commercial nature of which there is written evidence or, in certain instances, that are the subject of entries in books of account. The average tax rate ranges between 1% and 1.5% and it is applicable on the economic value of the contract.
In the city of Buenos Aires, the standard tax rate is 1% of the aggregate amount of the transactions, contracts, and deeds that are subject to the stamp tax. Special rates of 0.5%, 1.2%, 3%, and 3.6% are also established.
## Turnover tax (gross income tax)
Each of the 24 jurisdictions into which Argentina is divided imposes a tax on gross revenues from the sale of goods and services. Exports of goods are exempt, and certain industries are subject to a reduced tax rate. Rates, rules, and assessment procedures are determined locally. On average, rates for trade and services range from 4% to 6%. In case of industry, rates are generally lower (ranging from 0% to 2%).
## Real estate tax
Real estate tax is usually assessed by the local tax authority, considering the property’s fiscal value and the tax rates established by the current year tax law.
## Tax on financial transactions (on credits and debits on bank accounts)
Bank account movements (deposits and withdrawals) are subject to a national tax on financial transactions at the following rates:
33% of the tax on financial transactions effectively paid on bank account transactions (0.6%) and movement of funds (1.2%) is creditable against CIT and minimum notional income tax and/or respective tax advances.
## Wealth tax
An annual wealth tax is levied on the shares or holding in the capital of local companies owned by individuals or undivided estates domiciled in Argentina or abroad, and/or companies and/or any other type of legal person domiciled abroad. It shall be assessed and paid directly by the local company as a full and final payment on behalf of the shareholders (the issuing company has the right to recover from the shareholder the tax paid).
The applicable tax rate is 0.5% and is applicable on the value of the participation, which is generally calculated on the difference between assets and liabilities arising from the financial statements closed at 31 December or during the respective fiscal year.
Note that a Supreme Court decision has ruled on the non-applicability of this tax to Argentine branches of foreign companies.
## Payroll taxes and social security contributions
Foreign and local nationals working for a local company must be included on the local payroll and will be considered as local employees for local labour, tax, and social security purposes. Both the local company and the employees will be subject to the corresponding regulations.
All the compensation paid in Argentina or abroad for work performed for the local company will be considered as local compensation and should be reported to the tax and social security authorities, as the case may be, and included in the salary slips and recorded in the local labour books.
The local employer must withhold income tax on an actual and monthly basis and make the corresponding payments to the tax authorities through monthly WHT returns. Individual tax rates range from 5% to 35%, and personal deductions are available (under certain circumstances).
The local entity must issue salary slips every month for each employee included on its payroll, considering the total compensation mentioned above.
Employer social security contributions add between 24% and 26.4% to payroll costs. There is a compulsory 13th-month salary. There is no restriction regarding the employment of foreigners, provided they hold working visas.
Workers’ (Employees’) Compensation: Argentine labour regulations determine different forms of compensation for employees. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
Main social taxes and contributions assessable on salaries are as follows:
| Social taxes and contributions | Percentage of gross monthly earnings (%) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (including 13th month salary) | |
| Employer (2, 3) | Employee (1) |
| Pension fund | 18/20.4 | 11 |
| National unemployment fund | - | - |
| Family allowances fund | - | - |
| Social services institute for pensioner | - | 3 |
| Social health care plan | 6 | 3 |
| Total | 24/26.4 | 17 |
Notes
1. Social security charges borne by employees are applicable up to a monthly salary cap.
2. Argentine employers are exempt to pay social security contributions for the first ARS 7,003.68 per month per employee.
3. Employers' contributions to the national unemployment fund, family allowances fund, and social services institute for pensioners is paid at a unified rate of 18%. The rate is increased to 20.4% for companies whose main activity consists of rendering services or commerce, provided the amount of their total annual sales exceeds the amount to be considered a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME).

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Taxable period
Tax is assessed on a fiscal-year, self-assessment basis, which may or may not match the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The due date for filing the CIT return is during the second week of the fifth month after the fiscal year-end. Tax returns are filed electronically.
## Payment of tax
Instalment payments on account of CIT must be made in the course of the tax year. The instalment payments must be made on a monthly basis, beginning in the first month after the due date of filing of the tax returns.
### Penalties
Penalties derived from tax infractions may be applied by tax authorities, as follows:
### Interest on late payments
Late payment of taxes is subject to compensatory interest. The applicable rate is periodically updated by the tax authorities (currently 7.47%). Interest will start accruing on the day after the filing due date.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities are entitled to audit taxpayers within the statute of limitations period. Audits consist of revising the calculation of any national or provincial tax based on formal requirements. Where any assessment is issued by the tax authorities, the taxpayer is entitled to either accept it or file a claim. Assessments can be done under a real or estimated basis, depending on the specific case and the information that the taxpayers have on their transactions. In the case that the taxpayers do not accept the assessment during the administrative period, they can claim against Tax Courts before any judicial process.
There are no specific provisions about e-auditing.
## Statute of limitations
The actions and powers of the tax authorities to determine and require payment of federal taxes, and to implement and enforce fines and closures planned, prescribe:
The statute of limitations may be extended to ten years in certain provinces with respect to provincial taxes.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The employer Social Security Tax is payable on the employee’s total monthly compensation and is not subject to any cap amount. The total employer contribution is 26.4% for companies mainly engaged in the provision of services or trade, provided their annual sales exceed the amount established by the regulation that is updated annually (current amounts are ARS 6,520,009,000 for services and ARS 28,997,100,000 for trade), and 24% for all other companies.
Argentine employers are exempt from paying social security contributions for the first ARS 7,003.68 per month per employee.
The employee social security withholdings, which include pension fund, healthcare, and social services, are payable on the monthly salary, up to a monthly cap of ARS 2,841,525.42 (as of 1 December 2024), except for June and December, where the cap is increased by 50% due to the 13th month salary. This salary cap is index-adjusted in March, June, September, and December of each year.
The total employee Social Security Tax rate is 17%, which consists of contributions of 11% to the pension fund, 3% to healthcare, and 3% to social services.
## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT) is assessable on the sales value of products (e.g. raw materials, produce, finished, or partly finished merchandise) with few exemptions, most services (e.g. construction, utilities, professional and personal services not derived from employment, rental), and on import of goods and services. The VAT rate is 21%, although certain specific items are subject to a 10.5% and 27% rate. The VAT is also applicable on earning derived from a self-employed activity, at a general rate of 21%. It is paid by filing monthly tax returns.
The increased rate of 27% applies to 'utilities services' (e.g. telecommunications, household gas, running water, sewerage, and energy) not rendered to real estate used for dwelling purposes.
A reduced rate of 10.5% applies to certain transactions, including (but not limited to) the following:
VAT paid on purchases, final imports, and rental of automobiles not considered as inventory, cannot be computed by the purchaser as a VAT credit. The same tax treatment applies to other services, such as those provided by restaurants, hotels, and garages.
Registered VAT payers, except for taxpayers carrying out certain activities that, due to the singularities of their transactions, are required to include in their tax returns specific information, are required to use a web-based (online) modality for filing VAT return.
## Tax on personal assets (wealth tax)
On June 2024, Argentina’s Congress approved Law N° 27.743, and introduced new modifications to Wealth tax.  Updated deductions and scales were settled for fiscal year 2023 and onwards. A new “Special Advance Payment Regime” (“Régimen especial de Ingreso del Impuesto sobre los Bienes Personales” or “REIBP”) was implemented, offering taxpayers in Argentina an opportunity to simplify their tax obligations while securing fiscal stability. This voluntary program is tailored to individuals and undivided estates who were Argentine tax residents as of December 31, 2023. Non-residents with a local representative may also participate. The regime allows taxpayers to make one advance payment and avoid future tax return filings and tax payments until fiscal period 2027.
Participants benefit from fixed tax rates of 0.45% for unreported assets and 0.50% for those regularized through Argentina’s disclosure regime. Additionally, increases in net worth during this period generally do not create new liabilities unless specific conditions apply, such as donations.
One of the most attractive features of the REIBP is the fiscal stability it guarantees, extending until 2038. This ensures predictable obligations, with reduced tax rates after 2027. To join, taxpayers must make an initial payment covering 75% of the calculated liability, which is credited toward the total obligation.
For those individuals/undivided states, who decided to not adhere to REIBP, will be subject to an annual wealth tax on their worldwide taxable personal assets exceeding the minimum exempt threshold as of 31 December, without consideration of liabilities. These taxable assets include, among other items, real estate, cars, and bank accounts. However, savings accounts, term deposits at Argentine banks, and Argentine government bonds are tax-exempt. Individuals domiciled abroad and working in Argentina for reasons duly proven for a period not longer than five years are assessable only on personal assets located in Argentina.
For fiscal 2023 and onwards, new progressive tax rates are established for personal property, eliminating the distinction between assets located in the country and abroad. The rates will be applied uniformly and will gradually reduce to 0.25% by 2027.
The non-taxable minimum is increased to ARS 100,000,000(\*) for the year 2023, and the exempt amount for housing is raised to ARS 350,000,000(\*).
Those taxpayers ("Good Taxpayers") who have fulfilled all their tax obligations between 2020 and 2022 can access a 0.50% reduction in the applicable rate for the periods 2023 to 2025.
(\*) Tax rates and exempt minimum will be adjusted annually, considering the annual variation of the Consumer Price Index.
FY 2023 tax rates for assets held:
| Taxable assets (ARS) | | Tax on column 1 (ARS) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Up to (inclusive) |
| 0 | 13,688,704.14 | - | 0.00 |
| 13,688,704.14 | 29,658,858.98 | 68,443.51 | 0.75 |
| 29,658,858.98 | 82,132,224.86 | 188,219.68 | 1.00 |
| 82,132,224.86 | 456,290,138.07 | 712,953.35 | 1.25 |
| 456,290,138.07 | and over | 5,389,927.27 | 1.50 |
FY 2023 tax rates for assets held by "Good Taxpayers":
| Taxable assets (ARS) | | Tax on column 1 (ARS) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Up to (inclusive) |
| 0 | 13,688,704.14 | - | 0.00 |
| 13,688,704.14 | 29,658,858.98 | - | 0.25 |
| 29,658,858.98 | 82,132,224.86 | 39,925.39 | 0.50 |
| 82,132,224.86 | 456,290,138.07 | 302,292.22 | 0.75 |
| 456,290,138.07 | and over | 3,108,476.56 | 1.00 |
All taxpayers must file an annual tax return and pay the tax liability in June of each year.
Individuals living abroad who own assets located in Argentina must pay the corresponding tax in full and final settlement through a local representative in June of each year. The tax rate is 0.5%. Tax is not levied where tax liability on each year does not exceed ARS 255.75.
Shares held in Argentine companies and participation in *fideicomisos* (local trusts) set up in Argentina are not included in the shareholder’s wealth tax return. However, the respective company and *fideicomiso* must determine wealth tax on the participation owned by individuals residing in the country or abroad, or owned by companies residing abroad. The wealth tax rate is 0.5% and is payable by the company or local trust to the tax authorities. However, reimbursement from the shareholders can be claimed.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
There is no federal gift and inheritance tax in Argentina. However, the province of Buenos Aires has gift and inheritance taxes based on certain conditions and amounts. The federal government and other provinces may introduce similar taxes in the future.
## Real property tax and automobile duty
There is no federal real property tax or automobile duty in Argentina. Property taxes fall within the authority of the provinces. Federal property taxes are included in the wealth tax.
Real estate tax is levied on the ownership of real estate properties in each jurisdiction. Automobile duty is levied on the ownership of cars registered (car plate licence) in each jurisdiction.
Amounts are determined by provincial taxation authorities based on the fiscal valuation of the asset (also determined by the tax authority) and the tax rates in force under the annual tax law. Payments must usually be made on a monthly or a bimonthly basis.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is levied by each of the 24 jurisdictions in Argentina and applies principally to contracts and agreements, deeds, mortgages, and other obligations. It also applies to agreements and discharges of a civil, financial, or commercial nature, of which there is written evidence, or in certain instances, that are the subject of entries in books of accounts. The average tax rate is 1% applicable on the economic value of the contract.
In the City of Buenos Aires, special rates of 0.5%, 1%, 1.2%, 1.5%, 3%, and 3.6% are aaplicable depending on the kind of transactions and, in the case of transactions involving uncertain consideration, a fixed tax  is applicable (on the fulfilment of certain conditions).
## Tax on bank account debits and credits
Debits and credits from bank accounts are subject to this tax at 0.6% on the amount of the transaction. However, the deposit and disposal of employment compensation and pension payments are tax exempt.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Individuals resident in Argentina are taxable on worldwide income and may obtain a foreign tax credit for taxes paid on income from foreign sources.
Non-residents and foreign beneficiaries are only taxable on their Argentine-source income.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
### Employees with tax applied on highest incomes
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new "cedular regime" that was applied on the "highest incomes", understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum. Under this scenario, employees, retirees, and pensioners (not applicable to directors) should pay income tax only when their gross monthly salary was greater than 15 times the SMVM at the time of tax determination. In addition, a progressive scale was incorporated, whose rates will be established between 27% and 35%. This new regime was applicable since January to June 2024.
From July onwards, the “Cedular regime” was repealed by the Government and the income tax withholding mechanism that was in force up to September 2023 was reimplemented and updated (annual taxable income 35% tax rate over AR$ 41.316.075 after available deductions was reinstated).
### Self-employed workers (including members of boards of directors)
The following PIT rates are applicable as of 31 December 2024:
| Taxable income (ARS) | | Tax on column 1 (ARS) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 1,200,000 | - | 5 |
| 1,200,000 | 2,400,000 | 60.000 |  |
| 2,400,000 | 3,600,000 | 168.000 | 12 |
| 3,600,000 | 5,400,000 | 312.000 | 15 |
| 5,400,000 | 10,800,000 | 582.000 | 19 |
| 10,800,000 | 16,200,000 | 1.608.000 | 23 |
| 16,200,000 | 24,300,000 | 2.850.000 | 27 |
| 24,300,000 | 36,450,000 | 5.037.000 | 31 |
| 36,450,000 | and on | 8.803.500 | 35 |
## Gross income tax
Gross income tax is a provincial tax applicable to self-employed individuals on gross earnings. The average tax rate is 4% in the Federal Capital (the City of Buenos Aires), and similar rates are applicable in the different provinces. Professionals who do not perform their activity in the form of a company are exempt from the gross income tax in the City of Buenos Aires. The tax is paid by filing monthly tax returns.
## Foreign beneficiary tax
Foreign beneficiaries working temporarily in Argentina for no more than six months during the year, who earn income through either the visual or performing arts or other profession, are subject to income tax on these earnings at the rate of 24.5% (35% on assumed profit of 70% of gross income) to be withheld by the local payer. Other tax rates could apply depending on the type of income to be paid.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Taxable period
Tax for individuals in Argentina is assessable on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
The earnings of each spouse (e.g. from employment and business activities) are assessable separately and individually.
With respect to registered taxpayers, the general due date for filing a return is May/June of each year.
Individual PIT returns are not required to be filed for payment purposes by employees who have no sources of income other than payroll compensation, since the tax must be duly withheld at source by the employer.
The employers should prepare, by the end of April of the following year, an annual wage tax return reporting the annual compensation, deductions, and withholdings performed for each fiscal year, which is to be filed with the tax authorities. The Informative Income Tax return has been repealed from fiscal period 2023.
In addition, employees with annual gross compensation over ARS 15.9 million (for FY 2023) (\*) are also required to report their personal assets as of 31 December of the year (locally and abroad) in a separate information PIT return, which is also due on 30 June of each year.
Resident and non-resident employees who receive taxable income other than employment income are required to file an annual Argentine PIT return for payment purposes in June of the following year.
Self-employed workers (including members of boards of directors) must register with the tax authorities and file an annual PIT return in June of every year. In addition, they are required to make advance payments on account of their income tax liability of the current year based on their income tax liability of the prior fiscal year.
Foreign beneficiaries have no filing obligations, since they are subject to income tax withholding at source by the local paying entity on a final and definite basis.
Tax returns are filed electronically. It is required that the taxpayer applies personally for a special fiscal code (*clave fiscal*) to be able to access the tax authorities' website.
(\*) The information is not updated for FY 2024, yet.
## Electronic invoicing
All registered VAT payers are compelled to use electronic invoicing, and the use of the paper-based mechanism has been discontinued.
A few exceptions to the use of electronic invoicing remain in force, including operations performed by certain small taxpayers (*Monotributistas*), invoicing through the use of special fiscal hardware (*Controlador fiscal*), back-up invoicing systems, and invoicing in certain specific activities.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries. Employers are required to withhold these taxes on a monthly and actual basis at the appropriate personal rates applied to the net taxable remuneration of each employee.
Self-employed workers must pay the balance due on their taxes subsequent to the filing of the respective tax return at the authorised banks. Payments can also be made electronically from the web pages of Argentine banks.
The due date for payment of individual income taxes determined in a tax return is the day following the tax return filing due date which depends on the individual tax identification, *Clave Unica de Identificación Tributaria* (CUIT).
## Audit cycle
The federal tax authority in Argentina is the *Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos* (AFIP). The AFIP is entitled to audit any tax return filed by a taxpayer at its sole discretion during the statute of limitations.
An audit is an AFIP review of an individual's income, accounts, personal assets and financial information to ensure information is being reported correctly and to verify the amount of tax reported on the individual's tax return is accurate. An individual's tax return may be examined for a variety of reasons, and the examination may take place in any one of several ways.
Returns are chosen by computerised screening, by random sample, or by an income document matching program. After the examination, if any changes to the individual's tax are proposed, one can either agree with those changes and pay any additional tax owed plus interest for late payment and fines that may have been applied, or one can disagree with the changes and appeal the decision. In most instances the taxpayer may take the case to court.
The tax authority is empowered to send information requests to taxpayers which must be duly responded to using special forms. The due date for responding to information requests is defined by the tax agent but generally is 15 administrative working days from the day the taxpayer is formally notified.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years for registered taxpayers and ten years for non-registered taxpayers. Nevertheless, in 2020, tax moratorium legislation extended this period by one year for those tax years that remained open at that time.
The statute of limitations will also limit the time taxpayers have to file a claim for credit or refund.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
CIT rate is set as follows (indexed as of 2024):
Legal entities resident in Argentina are subject to tax on Argentine and foreign-source income. Resident legal entities are able to claim any similar taxes actually paid abroad on foreign-source income as a tax credit. The tax rate applies on net income determined on a worldwide basis.
A withholding tax (WHT) on dividend distributions and branch profit remittances is established at a rate of 7% (applicable for profits as of 2018).
The 2017 tax reform abolished the so-called ‘equalisation tax’ for profits generated in taxable years starting on or after 1 January 2018. The equalisation tax was a WHT levied at a 35% rate on dividend distributions in excess of tax earnings. The equalisation tax, however, remains applicable on dividend and branch profit distributions made out of earnings accumulated prior to 1 January 2018 and which were in excess of tax earnings as of the year-end prior to the relevant distribution.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The employer Social Security Tax is payable on the employee’s total monthly compensation and is not subject to any cap amount. The total employer contribution is 26.4% for companies mainly engaged in the provision of services or trade, provided their annual sales exceed the amount established by the regulation that is updated annually (current amounts are ARS 6,520,009,000 for services and ARS 28,997,100,000 for trade), and 24% for all other companies.
Argentine employers are exempt from paying social security contributions for the first ARS 7,003.68 per month per employee.
The employee social security withholdings, which include pension fund, healthcare, and social services, are payable on the monthly salary, up to a monthly cap of ARS 2,841,525.42 (as of 1 December 2024), except for June and December, where the cap is increased by 50% due to the 13th month salary. This salary cap is index-adjusted in March, June, September, and December of each year.
The total employee Social Security Tax rate is 17%, which consists of contributions of 11% to the pension fund, 3% to healthcare, and 3% to social services.
## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT) is assessable on the sales value of products (e.g. raw materials, produce, finished, or partly finished merchandise) with few exemptions, most services (e.g. construction, utilities, professional and personal services not derived from employment, rental), and on import of goods and services. The VAT rate is 21%, although certain specific items are subject to a 10.5% and 27% rate. The VAT is also applicable on earning derived from a self-employed activity, at a general rate of 21%. It is paid by filing monthly tax returns.
The increased rate of 27% applies to 'utilities services' (e.g. telecommunications, household gas, running water, sewerage, and energy) not rendered to real estate used for dwelling purposes.
A reduced rate of 10.5% applies to certain transactions, including (but not limited to) the following:
VAT paid on purchases, final imports, and rental of automobiles not considered as inventory, cannot be computed by the purchaser as a VAT credit. The same tax treatment applies to other services, such as those provided by restaurants, hotels, and garages.
Registered VAT payers, except for taxpayers carrying out certain activities that, due to the singularities of their transactions, are required to include in their tax returns specific information, are required to use a web-based (online) modality for filing VAT return.
## Tax on personal assets (wealth tax)
On June 2024, Argentina’s Congress approved Law N° 27.743, and introduced new modifications to Wealth tax.  Updated deductions and scales were settled for fiscal year 2023 and onwards. A new “Special Advance Payment Regime” (“Régimen especial de Ingreso del Impuesto sobre los Bienes Personales” or “REIBP”) was implemented, offering taxpayers in Argentina an opportunity to simplify their tax obligations while securing fiscal stability. This voluntary program is tailored to individuals and undivided estates who were Argentine tax residents as of December 31, 2023. Non-residents with a local representative may also participate. The regime allows taxpayers to make one advance payment and avoid future tax return filings and tax payments until fiscal period 2027.
Participants benefit from fixed tax rates of 0.45% for unreported assets and 0.50% for those regularized through Argentina’s disclosure regime. Additionally, increases in net worth during this period generally do not create new liabilities unless specific conditions apply, such as donations.
One of the most attractive features of the REIBP is the fiscal stability it guarantees, extending until 2038. This ensures predictable obligations, with reduced tax rates after 2027. To join, taxpayers must make an initial payment covering 75% of the calculated liability, which is credited toward the total obligation.
For those individuals/undivided states, who decided to not adhere to REIBP, will be subject to an annual wealth tax on their worldwide taxable personal assets exceeding the minimum exempt threshold as of 31 December, without consideration of liabilities. These taxable assets include, among other items, real estate, cars, and bank accounts. However, savings accounts, term deposits at Argentine banks, and Argentine government bonds are tax-exempt. Individuals domiciled abroad and working in Argentina for reasons duly proven for a period not longer than five years are assessable only on personal assets located in Argentina.
For fiscal 2023 and onwards, new progressive tax rates are established for personal property, eliminating the distinction between assets located in the country and abroad. The rates will be applied uniformly and will gradually reduce to 0.25% by 2027.
The non-taxable minimum is increased to ARS 100,000,000(\*) for the year 2023, and the exempt amount for housing is raised to ARS 350,000,000(\*).
Those taxpayers ("Good Taxpayers") who have fulfilled all their tax obligations between 2020 and 2022 can access a 0.50% reduction in the applicable rate for the periods 2023 to 2025.
(\*) Tax rates and exempt minimum will be adjusted annually, considering the annual variation of the Consumer Price Index.
FY 2023 tax rates for assets held:
| Taxable assets (ARS) | | Tax on column 1 (ARS) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Up to (inclusive) |

FY 2023 tax rates for assets held by "Good Taxpayers":
| Taxable assets (ARS) | | Tax on column 1 (ARS) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Up to (inclusive) |
| 0 | 13,688,704.14 | - | 0.00 |
| 13,688,704.14 | 29,658,858.98 | - | 0.25 |

| 82,132,224.86 | 456,290,138.07 | 302,292.22 | 0.75 |
| 456,290,138.07 | and over | 3,108,476.56 | 1.00 |
All taxpayers must file an annual tax return and pay the tax liability in June of each year.
Individuals living abroad who own assets located in Argentina must pay the corresponding tax in full and final settlement through a local representative in June of each year. The tax rate is 0.5%. Tax is not levied where tax liability on each year does not exceed ARS 255.75.
Shares held in Argentine companies and participation in *fideicomisos* (local trusts) set up in Argentina are not included in the shareholder’s wealth tax return. However, the respective company and *fideicomiso* must determine wealth tax on the participation owned by individuals residing in the country or abroad, or owned by companies residing abroad. The wealth tax rate is 0.5% and is payable by the company or local trust to the tax authorities. However, reimbursement from the shareholders can be claimed.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
There is no federal gift and inheritance tax in Argentina. However, the province of Buenos Aires has gift and inheritance taxes based on certain conditions and amounts. The federal government and other provinces may introduce similar taxes in the future.
## Real property tax and automobile duty
There is no federal real property tax or automobile duty in Argentina. Property taxes fall within the authority of the provinces. Federal property taxes are included in the wealth tax.
Real estate tax is levied on the ownership of real estate properties in each jurisdiction. Automobile duty is levied on the ownership of cars registered (car plate licence) in each jurisdiction.
Amounts are determined by provincial taxation authorities based on the fiscal valuation of the asset (also determined by the tax authority) and the tax rates in force under the annual tax law. Payments must usually be made on a monthly or a bimonthly basis.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is levied by each of the 24 jurisdictions in Argentina and applies principally to contracts and agreements, deeds, mortgages, and other obligations. It also applies to agreements and discharges of a civil, financial, or commercial nature, of which there is written evidence, or in certain instances, that are the subject of entries in books of accounts. The average tax rate is 1% applicable on the economic value of the contract.
In the City of Buenos Aires, special rates of 0.5%, 1%, 1.2%, 1.5%, 3%, and 3.6% are aaplicable depending on the kind of transactions and, in the case of transactions involving uncertain consideration, a fixed tax  is applicable (on the fulfilment of certain conditions).
## Tax on bank account debits and credits
Debits and credits from bank accounts are subject to this tax at 0.6% on the amount of the transaction. However, the deposit and disposal of employment compensation and pension payments are tax exempt.

# Argentina
## Overview
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
The Republic of Argentina is located in South America, approximately between latitudes 23°S (Tropic of Capricorn) and 55°S (Cape Horn). The Andes separates the country from Chile in the west, and it borders Bolivia and Paraguay in the north and Brazil, Uruguay, and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east.
Argentina's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants from all over Europe, but particularly from Italy and Spain, which provided the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. The Republic of Argentina is made up of 23 provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, its capital. The official language of Argentina is Spanish, and the currency is the peso (ARS). Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
During the period 2019-2023, Alberto Fernández was the president of the country. His government faced a pandemic, a war, and a very deep drought. Although the economy expanded in 2021 and 2022, a number of macroeconomic imbalances continued to have an impact on the country. In this sense, by the end of Alberto Fernández's government period, inflation reached the highest levels since the 1990s, exchange restrictions were highly increased, the exchange gap reached a record near 200%, and the poverty levels finished at 40.1%.
In this challenging panorama, Javier Milei, a political outsider, assumed the presidency in December 2023, which confirmed a social discontent regarding the country's situation. In the first days of government, the new administration carried out measures that included a fiscal adjustment with the aim of reaching balance in 2024 and a devaluation of the official exchange rate of 54%. The aforementioned depreciation, although it reduced the exchange gap, had an impact on the inflation levels. Parallel to this, the National Executive Branch issued an Emergency Decree (DNU) and summoned the National Congress for extraordinary sessions to discuss a bill including comprehensive deregulations and the repeal of laws and sectoral economic regimes. Despite these measures, the national economic context remains uncertain and challenging given the imbalances that take place in the country.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## WHT on dividend and profit distributions
WHT on dividend distributions and branch profit remittances has been set at a rate of 7% for profits generated in fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The 2017 tax reform has abolished the so-called ‘equalisation tax’ for profits generated in taxable years starting on or after 1 January 2018. The equalisation tax was a WHT levied at a 35% rate on dividend distributions in excess of tax earnings. However, the equalisation tax still applies to dividend and branch profit distributions made out of earnings accumulated prior to 1 January 2018 that exceeded tax earnings as of the year-end prior to the relevant distribution.
## Other payments
Other payments to residents and to non-residents are subject to WHT rates as follows:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest (1) | Royalties (1, 2) |
| Resident corporations | 6/28 (3) | 6 (4) |

Notes
1. Withholding from payments of interest and royalties to non-residents is based on a flat rate of 35% applied to an assumed percentage gross profit margin. This margin is not contestable, but the resultant rate may be limited by bilateral treaty. Under the 1998 tax reform, the general margin for interest paid for credits obtained abroad is 100%. However, a margin of 43% is applicable (i) if the debtor is a local bank; (ii) if the creditor is a foreign financial institution located in a country not considered as a low or no tax jurisdiction, or in countries that have signed an agreement with Argentina for exchange of information and have no bank secrecy laws, which are under the supervision of the respective central bank; (iii) if the interest is paid on a loan dedicated to the purchase of tangible assets other than cars; (iv) if the interest is paid on debt certificates (private bonds) issued by local companies and registered in certain countries that have signed an agreement with Argentina for the protection of investments; and (v) on interest paid on time deposits with local banks.
Royalties’ covers a variety of concepts. The rates given in this column relate specifically to services derived from agreements ruled by the Foreign Technology Law, as follows:
Several other concepts of 'royalties' are subject to rates that, in turn, may be limited by treaty. A broad sample of these concepts and the non-treaty effective rates are set forth in Note 2.
2. Payments to non-residents (only) for 'royalties', rentals, fees, commissions, and so on, in respect of the following, are subject to withholding at the rates given below on the basis of assumed gross profit margins (Note 1) unless limited by treaty. The treaty concerned should be consulted to determine any limitation in each case.
| Payment | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Containers | 7.00 |
| Copyright | 12.25 |
| Rental of movable assets | 14.00 |
| Motion picture, video, and sound tape rentals and royalties; radio, television, telex and telefax transmissions; any other means for projection, reproduction, transmission, or diffusion of image or sound; sale of assets located in Argentina | 17.50 |
| Rental of real estate | 21.00 |
| Any other Argentine-source income (unless the non-resident is or was temporarily resident) | 31.50 |
3. The higher tax rate is applicable on non-registered taxpayers. On interest paid to corporations by financial entities or stock exchange/open market brokers, income tax must be withheld at 3% (10% if not registered); individuals are tax exempt.
4. Resident corporations and individuals who are registered for tax purposes are subject to 6% withholding (28% if not registered).
5. Interest is exempt if paid on credit sales of machinery or other equipment, specific bank loans at preferential rate or loans by public entities.
6. The treaty limits taxation of interest to 20% (registered).
7. The 10% rate is applicable to interest on credit sales of capital equipment, any bank loan, or any financing of public works; otherwise, 15%.
8. Interest paid on loans with guarantee of the Norwegian Institute for Credit Guarantees or paid in relation to imports of industrial equipment is tax exempt.
9. Treaty signed in December 2019. Still pending ratification by both countries.
10. Treaty signed in June 2019. Still pending ratification by both countries.
11. Treaty signed in April 2019. Still pending ratification by both countries.
12. An amending Protocol has been signed in December 2019 that is still pending of ratification. Once in force, it will introduce a reduction on interest WHT (12%) and on royalty WHT (3%/5%/10%).

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation is based on the latest purchase. Thus, the last in first out (LIFO) method may not be elected for tax purposes. Conformity between book and tax reporting is not required.
## Capital gains/losses
Capital gains and losses attract normal CIT treatment, except that losses from the sale of shares, equity interests, bonds, and similar securities may be offset only against the same type of income.
### Capital gains on equity
Gains derived from the transfer of shares, bonds, and other securities are subject to tax at regular CIT rates (25% to 35%).
Non-residents are subject to capital gains tax on the disposal of Argentine equities at a 13.5% effective tax rate on gross proceeds or, alternatively, a 15% income tax on the actual capital gain if the seller’s tax cost basis can be duly documented for Argentine tax purposes. Disposal of equities listed in the local stock exchange and American Depository Receipts (ADRs)/Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) are tax exempt, provided certain conditions are met.
### Capital gains on debts
Capital gains derived by foreign beneficiaries from the sale of corporate bonds placed by public offer (*obligaciones negociables*), notes issued by financial trusts (*títulos de deuda*), or government bonds should be exempt from profits tax, provided certain conditions are met.
## Dividend income
## Royalty income
Royalty income should be included as part of the taxpayer’s taxable income and will be subject to the standard CIT rates.
## Foreign exchange gains/losses
The general rule is that foreign exchange results (gain or losses) have to be recognised on an accrual basis. However, in some cases, the cash basis is applicable.
Foreign exchange losses arising from inter-company financing are subject to thin capitalisation rules.
## Foreign income
Foreign income received or held undistributed abroad (in case of investments in non-stock companies) by resident corporations is subject to tax. Note that an Argentine taxpayer is immediately taxed on the passive income generated by a controlled foreign company (CFC) that is directly or indirectly held by the Argentine taxpayer to the extent that more than 50% of that CFC’s income is passive and is effectively subject to a tax that is lower than 75% of the applicable Argentine income tax rate. Tax losses from a foreign source can only be offset against income from a foreign source.

## Asset Regularization Regime
An Asset Regularization Regime was established by Law 27.743 providing taxpayers with a legal framework to disclose undeclared assets located in Argentina or abroad. This voluntary regime allows individuals, undivided estates and entities to bring previously unreported assets into compliance, such as real estate, financial instruments, and other properties, under specific conditions. By adhering to this regime, taxpayers avoid fines and penalties associated with non-compliance. Additionally, the law offers reduced tax rates based on the type and timing of the disclosure, incentivizing early participation.
## Promotional Regime for Large Investment
The Argentine Congress has recently passed a comprehensive law package that introduces, among several legislative amendments, a Promotional Regime for Large Investment (RIGI for its Spanish acronym). This alert summarizes the key aspects of this innovative and attractive regime designed to attract large investments to the country.
RIGI is a comprehensive promotional regime designed to provide certainty, stability, legal security and protection to foster specific long-term investments in Argentina, by offering tax, customs, and currency exchange incentives.
The regime applies nationwide, encompassing sectors such as forestry, tourism, infrastructure, mining, technology, steel, energy and oil and gas.
The deadline to adhere to the regime is two years as from the law's enactment, with an option for a one-year extension.
### **Tax Incentives**
1. **Corporate Income Tax** ***a) Tax Rate:*** The maximum rate will be 25%.
2. **Value Added Tax (VAT):** No VAT immobilization for VPUs, as they will be allowed to pay VAT to their suppliers using Fiscal Credit Certificates, which will not generate fiscal credit for the VPU and will be treated as freely available tax credits for the supplier.
3. **Tax on Banking Transactions:** Fully creditable against income tax payments.
### **Customs Incentives**
1. **Import Duties:** Imports for consumption of goods, as well as temporary imports conducted by VPUs, including capital goods, spare parts, parts, and components, will be exempt from import duties, statistical rate, and from all national and/or local tax withholding, collection, advance payment, or retention regimes. This exemption may also be extended to imports destined to VPUs made by local suppliers (subject to special registration).
2. **Export Duties:** Exports performed by VPUs will be exempt from export duties after three years from the adhesion date (reduced to two years for projects declared as Long-term Strategic Exports).
3. **Import and Export Restrictions:** Registered VPUs can freely import and export without direct prohibitions, quantitative restrictions, quotas, or economic qualitative restrictions.
### **Foreign Exchange Incentives**
Proceeds from exports performed by the VPU will be exempt from the obligation to enter and/or negotiate and liquidate in the exchange market in the following percentages: a) 20% after two years from the registration date; b) 40% after three years from the registration date; c) 100% after four years from the registration date. These periods are reduced by one year for projects qualified as Long-term Strategic Exports.
Further, VPUs will also have free availability of foreign currency from local or external financing disbursed after the enactment of the regime. Additionally, exchange regulations imposing restrictions or prior authorizations for accessing the currency market for repaying loans, interest, accessories, other financial debts, or repatriating direct investments by non-residents, or for paying dividends, profits, or interests to non-residents, will not apply to VPUs provided some requirements are met.
### **Stability**
RIGI will grant eligible VPUs with regulatory stability in tax, customs, and exchange matters for their projects, ensuring that the incentives awarded will not be affected by their repeal or by the creation of more burdensome regulations. This stability will last for 30 years from the registration date.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Expenses necessary to generate, maintain, and preserve taxable income, and related to the company activity, are usually tax deductible, with a few exceptions, to the extent they are fair and reasonable.
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the technically estimated useful life of the assets or, alternatively, over the standard useful life (e.g. machinery and equipment: ten years; furniture: ten years). Depreciation of buildings and other construction of real estate is 2% *per annum* on cost (on a straight-line basis), unless it can be proved that useful life is less than 50 years.
Depreciation of automobiles whose original cost exceeds ARS 20,000 is not deductible. Related expenses (gasoline vouchers, insurance, rentals, repairs and maintenance, etc.) are deductible up to an amount of ARS 7,200 per automobile per year.
Conformity between book and tax depreciation is not required.
Profit or loss on the sale of depreciated property is determined with reference to cost less depreciation, and is included in ordinary taxable income.
Percentage depletion is available for natural resources (mines, quarries, woods).
## Goodwill
The amortisation of goodwill cannot be deducted for CIT purposes. At the moment of sale, the taxable gain will be calculated by deducting the cost expenses (purchase price).
With regards to self-developed goodwill, at the moment of sale the cost will be the amount of expenses incurred in obtaining it, provided it was not deducted for CIT purposes before.
R&D expenditures (for the development of intangible assets) may be deducted when they are incurred or amortised over not more than five years, at the option of the taxpayer. Expenditures for R&D in connection with the creation of fixed assets form part of the assets' cost and are amortised over their useful lives.
The amortisation of brands and licences acquired can be deducted if they have a limited term of duration.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses may be deducted when incurred or amortised over not more than five years, at the option of the taxpayer.
## Interest expenses
The tax law establishes a restriction on the deductibility of interest and foreign exchange losses arising from debts of a financial nature contracted by taxpayers with controlling/related entities for CIT purposes (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debt
## Charitable contributions
When made to societies and associations expressly exempt from assessment of CIT, donations are admissible deductions at up to a maximum of 5% of the donor’s net taxable profits, provided certain requirements are fulfilled.
## Representation expenses
If adequately documented, representation expenses are permissible deductions at up to 1.5% of the amount of salaries accrued during the fiscal year. According to the Regulatory Decree, representation expenses are payments made in order to represent the company in the market, to improve and maintain its relationship with suppliers and clients, etc.
## Directors’ fees
Amounts up to the greater of 25% of after-tax profit or ARS 12,500 per individual are deductible in the financial year to which they apply, provided they are approved and available for the director before the due date of the tax return or in a later year of payment.
## Fines and penalties
In relation to deductibility of penalties to determine net taxable income, taxpayers are not allowed to deduct sums paid on their own account corresponding to penalties, litigation costs, penalty interest, and other costs derived from tax obligations.
## Taxes
Except for CIT and the tax on minimum notional income, all taxes are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses may be carried forward for five years. Loss carrybacks are not permitted. Furthermore, foreign-source losses must be offset against income from similar sources.
Losses on derivatives transactions with speculative purposes can only be used to offset income from the same types of transactions.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions between related parties should be at arm’s length (*see Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*). This principle is extended to transactions with companies that are not located in jurisdictions considered to be ‘cooperative’ for tax transparency purposes or located in a tax haven. Payments to foreign affiliates or related parties and companies located in a tax haven or a non-cooperative jurisdiction that represent income of Argentine source are tax deductible, provided they are paid before the due date for filing the tax return and the corresponding withholding is paid to the tax authorities. Otherwise, they would be deducted in the fiscal year in which they are paid.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Group taxation is not permitted in Argentina.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regulations governing inter-company transactions adopt principles similar to those of the OECD, pursuant to which companies must comply with the arm’s-length principle in order to determine the value of goods and services in their transactions with foreign-related companies.
The following taxpayers, among others, must generally file, together with their annual CIT return, a supplementary return (transactions encompassed by regulations governing transfer prices) and transfer pricing study:
The Regulatory Decree provides specific rules to determine the fairness of the transfer pricing methodology. These rules are similar to those set by the OECD and contemplate six methods, including the following:
There is no specific hierarchy, as each particular transaction must be analysed based on the assets, functions, and risks involved and on information available. Regulations establish that the most appropriate method is that which reflects the economic reality of the transactions.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Through General Resolution (GR) 4130-E, the Federal Administration of Public Revenue (AFIP) established an annual information regime related to the submission of the CbC report and is aligned with Action 13 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan regarding CbC reporting.
This obligation is applicable to those multinational enterprise (MNE) groups whose ultimate parent’s total consolidated revenue is equal to or higher than 750 million euros (EUR), or its equivalent in the local currency converted to the exchange rate as of 31 January 2015, for the fiscal year prior to the one being reported. The CbC report will be filed annually, no later than the last business day of the 12th month following the end of the ultimate parent’s reporting fiscal year.
Although mainly MNE groups whose ultimate parent is resident in Argentina have the obligation to submit the CbC report, other Argentine entities from MNE groups may also be required to file a CbC report if certain circumstances set forth in the aforementioned resolution take place (i.e. subrogated entities not designated, etc.).
In addition, and regardless of having the obligation or not to file the CbC report in Argentina, the provisions in Title II of said GR require all Argentine entities that are members of a MNE group to file with the AFIP information about the MNE group they belong to, including if the group is required to comply with the submission of the CbC report and, if so, which company will perform the filing on behalf of the group (i.e. the ultimate parent or a subrogate entity). The local entity must comply with this obligation no later than the last business day of the third month following the end of the ultimate parent’s reporting fiscal year.
Finally, the member entities resident in the country mentioned in the preceding paragraph must report, until the last business day of the second month immediately following the due date for the submission of the CbC report, the submission of such report in the corresponding tax jurisdiction.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules apply as a restriction on the deductibility of interest and foreign exchange losses arising from debts of a financial nature that are contracted by taxpayers with related entities (whether local or foreign).
The deduction on interest expense and foreign exchange losses with local and foreign related parties is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s taxable income before interest, foreign exchange losses, and depreciation. The taxpayer is entitled to carry forward excess non-deductible interest for five years and unutilised deduction capacity for three years.
Certain exceptions to the above limitation are also available.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Argentina does not have a CFC regime. However, an Argentine taxpayer would be required to immediately tax passive income generated by a CFC that is directly or indirectly held by the Argentine taxpayer to the extent that more than 50% of that CFC’s income is passive and is effectively subject to a tax that is lower than 75% of the applicable Argentine income tax rate.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
National taxpayers are entitled to recognise a tax credit for any taxes actually paid in the countries where they have obtained foreign-source income, in respect of similar national taxes, up to a cap, which is the increase in their Argentine tax liability due to the inclusion of the foreign income. Any excess not offset in a given fiscal year may be carried forward to the next five fiscal years.
## Province of Tierra del Fuego Regime
Companies set up in the province of Tierra del Fuego enjoy a general tax exemption and important benefits in customs matters. Tax exemption includes CIT, tax on personal wealth and excise tax. The VAT benefit consists of the release from payment of the technical balance of the tax (VAT debits less VAT credits). Also, a reduction of the prevailing rate for tax on financial transactions and an exemption from taxation on the transfer of fuels is contemplated.
## Mining activity
An investment regime for mining activity is applicable to natural and legal persons. Mining ventures included within this regime enjoy fiscal stability (i.e. tax rates will remain basically the same) for a term of 30 years, except for VAT, which will adjust to the general regime. Furthermore, the regime grants incentives for CIT, tax on assets, import duties, and any other tax for introduction of certain assets. Additionally, this mining investment law established an exploration recovery regime for the mining investors, which allows the reimbursement of the VAT credit balances originated in the mining exploration activity.
This regime allows the reimbursement of such VAT credits after a 12-month period since the expenditure was incurred, and only if it has been paid.
Through specifics regulations, the authorities established the requirements (e.g. filing a tax return, filing a report certified by a public accountant with respect to the VAT, a presentation to the Mining Secretary) to be followed by the taxpayers in order to apply for this benefit.
## Forestry
There is an investment regime for plantation, protection, and maintenance of forests. It contains rules similar to those for mining activity tax incentives:
## Export incentives
Exports of goods and services are exempt from VAT and excise taxes. The temporary importation of raw materials and intermediate and packaging goods for the manufacture of products for export is free from duties with the obligation of offering sufficient guarantees for the import. A reimbursement regime is in place for VAT credits paid to suppliers in relation to the export activity.
## Biotechnology industry
A promotional tax regime for development and production of modern biotechnology has been introduced. Pursuant to this law, the beneficiaries of the projects that qualify for this regime are entitled to the following benefits:
## Energy generation through renewable sources
Through the enactment of Law 26,190, as amended by Law 27,191, and Regulatory Decree 562/2009 and 531/2016, the Argentine government launched and updated promotional measures for the energy sector with the aim of encouraging the use of renewable energy sources for the production of electricity.
According to this regime, certain tax benefits shall be granted upon request by filing the projects with the relevant authorities. Benefits include accelerated depreciation of project assets for CIT purposes, a five-year extension on the loss carryforward, early recovery of VAT paid on the acquisition of new assets or infrastructure work, and a tax credit certificate to be applied against federal taxes.
Also, from a provincial tax perspective, Law 26,190 invites all Argentine provinces to adhere to the regime enacting local regulations with tax benefits aimed at promoting and encouraging the production of electric energy through renewable sources.
## Province incentives on local taxes
Most of the provinces have legislation establishing incentives for the development of industries within their boundaries, especially industries that utilise or develop their natural resources and provide work for their residents. The incentives, in general, consist of exemptions from provincial and municipal taxes.
Various provinces have investment promotion regimes. Even when there are certain differences among these regimes, generally they include the following incentives:
These regimes are not automatically applied, and a special procedure should be followed to be entitled to the respective benefits.
## Free trade zones
The free trade zones offer exporters the possibility to import free from customs duties, statistics rate, and VAT all the necessary equipment for construction of a ‘turnkey plant’ within the zones. Furthermore, exporters manufacturing within the zones enjoy the benefit of buying supplies and raw materials from third countries, without having to pay duties or taxes that lead to increased prices.
## Promotional regime for knowledge-based activities
By virtue of Law 27,506 (amended by Law 27,570), Argentina’s government enacted new tax incentives intended to promote certain knowledge-based activities through the end of 2029. Taxpayers that comply with all requirements must apply and register in order to benefit from the new law.
The new regime aims to encourage the creation, design, production, and implementation or adaptation of products and services (and the associated technical documentation) related to, among others, the following ‘Promoted Activities’:
Incentives under the new regime include:
size. Large taxpayers would benefit from a 20% reduction (24% effective tax rate). Reduction for micro and small businesses is
60% and for medium sized enterprises is 40%. This reduction would apply to both Argentinian and foreign-source
income.
to employees dedicated to the Promoted Activities, which can be applied to the payment of certain taxes, such as VAT
(excluding CIT). This bonus certificate will increase to up to 80% of the social security contributions of new hires
considered included in special interest groups (including women, LGBT, people with disabilities, and residents in
unfavourable areas). Exporters may request the use of the certificate to offset CIT liabilities.
The incentives will become effective for income tax purposes starting with the fiscal year that follows the year in which taxpayers receive approval. However, they become effective for all other tax purposes as of the date the relevant governmental institution approves the registration. Furthermore, the incentives apply retroactively to 1 January 2020 for taxpayers that benefited under the software incentive regime, which expired on 31 December 2019.

## Legal entities
Foreign companies in Argentina, carrying out their business or activity in Argentina, must have a local legal vehicle, of which the most common legal entity types are the following:
Argentine corporations and limited liability partnerships (LLPs), as Argentine residents, are subject to the Argentine tax system. Branches of foreign companies, whatever the nature of their activities, are taxed under the same rules as those applicable to corporations and LLPs.
Several documents are required to register an entity with the relevant authorities. Some of said documentation must be filed in the original language, duly translated and certified with the Apostille issued pursuant to The Hague Convention or legalised by the Argentine Consulate of the company's place of origin.
At present, the minimum capital requirement to incorporate an SA is ARS 30,000,000. There are no special requirements regarding the minimum amount of capital for SRLs.
A branch does not require capital contributions unless it is engaged in certain specific activities (e.g. banking and financing). The branch must carry its financial statements separately from those of the foreign company.
The three legal types are subject, in general terms, to the same legal, tax, and accounting regulations.
## Information regimes
In the last few years, the AFIP has introduced several information regimes aimed principally to monitor transactions with local and foreign related parties.
By means of General Resolution (AFIP) 3572, a database in which local taxpayers must disclose their relationships with domestic and foreign related parties has been created. For purposes of this rule, the definition of ‘related party’ is broad and goes beyond economic or legal ownership.
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
Argentina has been very prolific in relation to the signature of tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) over the past few years.
The authorities have signed around 24 TIEAs, including those with Andorra, Aruba, Azerbaijan, The Bahamas, Bermuda, Brazil, Cayman Islands, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Ecuador, Guernsey, India, Isle of Man, Italy, Jersey, Macedonia, Monaco, Peru, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, and Uruguay.
Argentina has also taken an active part in the OECD’s BEPS initiatives and tax transparency discussions. During Berlin’s global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes, Argentina joined the list of 54 countries that agreed to implement an automatic financial information exchange in accordance to OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS) as of 2016.
In this respect, several Argentine regulatory authorities (i.e. Central Bank, Securities Exchange Commission, and Superintendence of Insurance Companies) have already issued a set of regulations compelling local financial institutions to implement the necessary procedures to be in compliance with OECD’s CRS. The regulation establishing the CRS was issued in December 2015 and is effective as of 1 January 2016.
Argentine authorities signed a bilateral agreement with the US government to facilitate implementation of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). In December 2022, Argentina signed an IGA under Model 1 with the United States whose effects would apply as from fiscal year 2023. The main objective of this agreement is to improve international tax compliance through domestic reporting and automatic exchange of information. This IGA will enable the reciprocal exchange of certain financial account information between the United States and Argentina with appropriate data protection.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Argentina has double tax treaties (DTTs) with a number of foreign countries for the purpose of eliminating double taxation. Where, according to the national laws of Argentina and another country, an individual would be subject to PIT on the same income in both countries, it must be ascertained whether relief or exemption from Argentine tax is available under a DTT. Most current treaties specify various tests to determine in which of the two countries an individual is resident for treaty purposes.
Most treaties also contain clauses that exempt a resident of one country from tax on employment income outside the other country and on employment income in the other country if an individual is present in the other country for less than 183 days in a year, provided that certain conditions are met regarding the terms of employment.
Tax credits are available for income taxes paid abroad on foreign source income. The foreign tax credit should not exceed the portion of Argentine tax attributable to the foreign source income.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Asset Regularization Regime
An Asset Regularization Regime was established by Law 27.743 providing taxpayers with a legal framework to disclose undeclared assets located in Argentina or abroad. This voluntary regime allows individuals, undivided estates and entities to bring previously unreported assets into compliance, such as real estate, financial instruments, and other properties, under specific conditions. By adhering to this regime, taxpayers avoid fines and penalties associated with non-compliance. Additionally, the law offers reduced tax rates based on the type and timing of the disclosure, incentivizing early participation.
## Changes to income tax
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new “cedular regime” that was applied on the “highest incomes”, understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum. Under this scenario, employees, retirees, and pensioners (not applicable to directors) should pay income tax only when their gross monthly salary was greater than 15 times the SMVM at the time of tax determination. In addition, a progressive scale was incorporated, whose rates will be established between 27% and 35%. This new regime was applicable since January to June 2024.
From July onwards, the “Cedular regime” was repealed by the Government and the income tax withholding mechanism that was in force up to September 2023 was reimplemented and updated (annual taxable income 35% tax rate over AR$ 41.316.075 after available deductions was reinstated).
## Modifications in tax on personal assets (wealth tax)
On June 2024, Argentina’s Congress approved Law N° 27.743, and introduced new modifications to Wealth tax.  Updated deductions and scales were settled for fiscal year 2023 and onwards. A new “Special Advance Payment Regime" (“Régimen especial de Ingreso del Impuesto sobre los Bienes Personales” or “REIBP”) was implemented, offering taxpayers in Argentina an opportunity to simplify their tax obligations while securing fiscal stability. This voluntary program is tailored to individuals and undivided estates who were Argentine tax residents as of December 31, 2023. Non-residents with a local representative may also participate. The regime allows taxpayers to make one advance payment and avoid future tax return filings and tax payments until fiscal period 2027.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Employment expenses
Social security taxes withheld by the employer are deductible from employment compensation for income tax purposes.
All personal deductions are also deductible from employment compensation. Employees are required to provide employers the information on personal deductions via an electronic Form 572 in order to be considered for income tax withholding calculations.
The annual electronic Form 572 may be filed during the year to update tax deductions when required, but final filing must be done prior to 31 March of the following fiscal year.
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new “cedular regime” that was applied on the “highest incomes”, understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum.

It also extends to those over 18 and up to 24 years old who are pursuing regular or professional studies and do not have income exceeding the non-taxable minimum income.

### Medical care contributions and expenses
Contributions to third-party medical schemes are deductible up to a maximum of 5% of net income. Other medical expenses may be deducted up to a maximum of 40% of all corresponding invoices of the fiscal year, provided the deduction does not exceed 5% of net income.

## Work permit
Foreigners working in Argentina must get a visa authorising them to perform paid work. There are two alternatives to apply for a working visa:
In both options, the local company must be registered in order to make the request on behalf of the foreign persons.
## Temporary visas
Expatriate employees with long-term assignments in Argentina and any accompanying family require at least a temporary visa for one year. This visa can be renewed each year for an additional year. After three years, the expatriate may apply for a permanent visa.
Temporary and permanent visas are obtained by filing the company's documentation before the Immigration Authority and personal documentation, birth, good conduct, and health certificates duly certified before the Argentine Consulate in the country of origin or permanent residence.
An individual coming to Argentina not for working purposes (i.e. tourism) does not need a visa if staying for less than three months. However, if an expatriate intends to work in Argentina for a short-term period (e.g. 30 days), then a special visa must be obtained.
In order to obtain a work visa, a special employment contract issued from the local employer is required.
## Holdings overseas and transactions reporting requirement
As of fiscal year 2011, individuals must file an informative return providing information about holdings in companies or entities (shares, private bonds, and other company ownerships) located abroad, owned at 31 December of each year. Individuals acting as trustees, trustors, or beneficiaries of trusts abroad must also report such information.
The informative annual return must be filed by the end of July of each year.
In addition to the annual tax return, individuals domiciled in Argentina must inform the tax authorities of purchases and sales of shares and other holdings in companies not traded in stock markets. Information about holdings from local or foreign entities with public offerings in stock markets must be provided only when they give rise to a modification in the corporate control. This information shall be submitted to the authority within ten days from the date on which the transaction took place.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Employment income
All remuneration paid in cash or in kind, including allowances, reimbursements, or paid expenses (e.g. housing and cost-of-living allowances, school fees, tax reimbursements), is taxable without regard to length of residence or source of income.
Business expenses paid directly or reimbursed on an actual basis by the employer are not considered taxable income. However, lump-sum payments would be subject to taxation. The use of a company car for business purposes is not considered taxable income. However, the deductibility of the related costs and expenses by the employer is subject to limitations.
## Equity compensation
Equity compensation must be reported and taxed through the individual payroll.
Income from stock options is determined as the difference between the fair market value of the stock when the option is exercised, and the price actually paid by the individual. Taxation is triggered at the moment of the option exercise.
There are no further rules in force regarding the taxation of other equity compensation plans or taxation in cross-border scenarios.
## Business income
## Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the transfer of shares and other participations in collective investment funds are liable to PIT at a 15% tax rate. A tax exemption is applicable for these securities to the extent they have been issued in an IPO or they have been traded in stock markets under the jurisdiction of the Argentine Security Exchange Commission (Comisión Nacional de Valores).
Capital gains derived from the transfer of government or corporate Argentine bonds and local mutual funds are exempt from income tax. Capital gains derived from digital currencies are subject to a 15% capital gains tax.
The transfer of Argentine shares, bonds, and quotas by non-residents is exempted from capital gain taxes in Argentina to the extent they reside or the funds derive from cooperative jurisdictions for Argentine tax purposes. To the extent the exemption is not applicable, non-residents are subject to 15% capital gain taxes calculated by applying the corresponding tax rate on a presumed gross margin of 90% (effective tax rate: 4.5% or 13.5%) or on the actual gain.
Transfer of real property by Argentine individuals is subject to a 15% capital gains tax calculated on the actual gain. The transfer of real property will only be subject to tax if said assets have been acquired after 1 January 2018.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by foreign companies are treated as foreign source income. They are taxable if distributed to residents at general PIT rates, but are not taxable if the beneficiary is a non-resident.
In case of dividends distributed by an Argentine company corresponding to year 2017 or earlier, distributing entities are required to make a flat and final income tax withholding of 35% from dividend payments or profit distributions to resident individuals or non-resident payees, to the extent that the amount of such dividends or profit distributions exceeds the taxable income of the distributing company, determined by applying the general tax rules (i.e. without considering any exemptions, abatements, and other adjustments arising from special promotional laws) included in their retained earnings at the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of payment or distribution.
Dividends distributed in connection with years 2018 and following are subject to a 7% withholding tax (WHT).
## Interest income
Interest income from Argentine or foreign sources are subject to PIT. However, the interest on savings bank accounts in Argentine banks is exempt from income tax.
## Rental income
Residents must report their worldwide rental income. Non-residents are taxable only on rental income from assets, including real estate, located in Argentina. Actual expenses incurred to maintain the property are deductible.
Rental income must be included in the annual PIT return and will be taxed at the general PIT rates. However, it should be considered that income tax withholding may be applicable on rental payments, depending on the tax status of the paying entity, which will be creditable in the annual tax return.
## Transparency rules
Transparency rules can be applicable, under certain conditions, to local income taxpayers regarding foreign shareholding with passive income.
## Exempt income
The most relevant exempt income items include the following:

Tax withholdings made by local entities and some specific tax payments might be taken as payments on account of the respective final tax liability.
A withholding regime is applicable to the purchase of foreign currency, credit card payments made in foreign currency, purchase of transportation tickets (air, sea, or land), and travel packages to foreign countries hired in Argentina. The applicable tax rate is 35% in case of acquisition of foreign currency and 45% in the rest of the cases.
Withholdings under the above-mentioned regime are creditable against wealth tax in case of registered small taxpayers (*Monotributistas*) and against income tax for other taxpayers.
Additionally, a percentage of the tax on credits on Argentine banks accounts can be taken as payment on account of the respective final income tax liability.
