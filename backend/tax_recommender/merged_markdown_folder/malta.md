## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuations are generally made at the lower of cost or market value. In general, the book and tax methods of inventory valuation will conform. However, the last in first out (LIFO) method is not accepted for taxation purposes. Obsolescence is accepted where proven, but there are no provisions to take into account the effects of monetary inflation on the inventory valuation.
## Capital gains
Tax is chargeable on capital gains realised on the transfer of immovable property (real estate), shares and other securities, business, goodwill, business permits, copyrights, patents, trade names, trademarks, any other intellectual property (IP), interests in a partnership, and beneficial interests in a trust.
No tax is levied on investments that yield a fixed rate of return. A tax exemption applies in certain instances and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions on the capital gain arising on the transfer of shares in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange other than shares held in certain collective investment schemes.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, if the asset is transferred between group companies, no loss or gain is deemed to arise from the transfer. Note that a provision exists that brings to charge the transfer of shares in property companies (as specifically defined) that were originally subject to intra-group tax deferral when the transferee ceases to be a member of the original group within six years from the date of such intra-group transfer.
Gains arising outside Malta and derived by a company that is either not domiciled or not ordinarily resident in Malta are not subject to tax. There are also a number of exemptions provided in the law. For example, gains realised by non-residents on transfers of units in Maltese collective investment schemes, similar investments relating to linked long-term insurance business and shares, or securities in Maltese companies (except for companies holding certain Maltese immovable property) are exempt from tax.
### Rollover relief
Rollover relief is granted with respect to capital assets used in a business for a period of at least three years and transferred and replaced within one year by an asset used solely for similar business purposes (i.e. no tax is chargeable on the capital gain). In such instances, the cost of acquisition of the new asset is reduced by the gain on the transfer of the previous asset that would otherwise have been taxable.
Maltese tax law also provides for the surrendering and claiming of allowable losses between companies that form part of the same group (*see the [Group taxation](malta/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*) as well as for reorganisation relief, subject to certain specific conditions.
## Dividend income
Dividends and gains on disposal of shares received by a corporate investor from a non-resident company (or from a non-resident partnership, subject to certain conditions), as well as profits from a PE, including a foreign branch, may qualify for a participation exemption in Malta, subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions.
The participation exemption may also apply to gains upon the disposal of equity holdings in Maltese-resident entities. Distributions of taxed income by Maltese-resident companies are not subject to further tax under the full imputation system.
All tax refund claim forms submitted should identify and disclose information relating to all the direct and indirect beneficial owners of the shareholder claiming the tax refund. Further to the changes relative to the beneficial ownership register brought about by the 5th AML Directive (EU) 2018/843, which was transposed into Maltese legislation through LN26 of 2020, art 5(3) of the Income Tax Management Act was amended (effective from 1 June 2020) such that the relevant certificate will only be considered as compliant where it identifies and discloses all the beneficiaries and ultimate beneficial owners of relevant trusts/fiduciary arrangements.
The participation exemption shall not apply to income derived from a participating holding in a body of persons resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction that is included in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for any period of three months during the year preceding the year of assessment. This exclusion does not apply if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the said body of persons maintains sufficient significant people functions in that jurisdiction (listed as non-cooperative) as is commensurate with the type and extent of the activity carried on in that jurisdiction and the income earned therefrom.
### Stock dividends
A Maltese company may distribute bonus shares from profits, whether of an income or capital nature, and from share premium and capital redemption reserves. When bonus shares represent a capitalisation of profits, they are deemed to be dividends for tax purposes. Such bonus shares are subject to tax in the recipients’ hands, gross of any tax paid at the corporate level on the relative profits, but tax credits equivalent to the gross-up of tax are available to stockholders.
## Interest income
Interest is chargeable to tax under the provisions of Article 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act and subject to the standard corporate tax rate. Nevertheless, in the event the receipt of interest falls within the definition of ‘investment income’ as established by Maltese tax legislation, a WHT of 15% may be generally applicable. Furthermore, in the case of interest income payable to non-Maltese residents, such interest should be exempt from Maltese tax, subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions.
## Royalty income
Similar to interest income, royalty income is chargeable to tax under the provisions of Article (4)(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act (*see Intellectual property in the [Deductions](malta/corporate/deductions.html) section for a description of the possibility of a tax deduction for expenditure of a capital nature on IP or any IP rights*). In the case of royalty income payable to non-Maltese residents, such royalty should be exempt from Maltese tax, subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions.
## Rental income
Corporates and individuals in receipt of income from the letting of urban and/or rural property and of commercial tenements and clubs, provided that such properties are not being rented to or from a related body of persons (as defined), have the option to apply a final 15% tax on the gross rental income (other tax rates may apply in specific circumstances).
Otherwise, the rental income is subject to normal rates of tax, but special tax deduction rules apply.
## Foreign income
A company is taxable on its worldwide income when it is ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta. A company that is either not ordinarily resident or not domiciled in Malta is taxable on its foreign income only insofar as such income is remitted to/received in Malta (or where such foreign income is treated as arising in Malta). Foreign tax is relieved by way of tax credits. This may occur under the terms of a DTT. Where no treaty exists, the foreign tax can be relieved through a system of unilateral relief. Relief for underlying tax is also granted with respect to dividend income, either in terms of a DTT or as unilateral relief. Such relief may be available if, among other things, evidence of tax paid abroad is produced.
Profits of Malta resident companies are subdivided for Maltese tax purposes into five accounts: the Immovable Property Account, the Final Tax Account, the Maltese Taxed Account, the Untaxed Account, and the Foreign Income Account. The last of these includes, among other things, taxable profits of Maltese-resident companies resulting from foreign investments; profits of a foreign PE; and profits resulting from foreign investments, assets, or liabilities of an onshore bank licensed in Malta. Income allocated to the Foreign Income Account for which no evidence of tax paid abroad is available can qualify for a flat-rate foreign tax credit of 25%.
The Immovable Property Account includes profits and income derived directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in Malta. The Final Tax Account includes, among other items, profits that have been subject to a final tax at source (apart from Maltese immovable property). The Maltese Taxed Account includes any other taxed profits while the Untaxed Account represents the difference between the distributable profits and the profits allocated to the other taxed accounts.
Under Malta’s system of taxation of dividends, shareholders receiving distributions from the Maltese Taxed Account and/or the Foreign Income Account may be entitled to a tax refund of part of the tax suffered by the distributing Maltese company on such profits being distributed. The tax refund may be either a six-sevenths refund, a five-sevenths refund, or a two-thirds refund of the tax suffered by the Maltese distributing company on the distributed profits. The type of the tax refund depends on the nature of the income to be distributed.

Notes
Treaties relating to international air and shipping traffic are in force with Switzerland and the United States (US).
The numbers in parentheses refer to the following notes:
1. No WHT is imposed on dividends distributed by Maltese companies (except for distributions of untaxed income to resident persons other than companies) because no additional tax is imposed on distributions other than the tax charged on the company with respect to the distributed profits. Malta makes no distinction between portfolio and substantial holdings. Under Maltese law, the dividend is grossed up by a figure representing the tax imposed on the company's profits when these were originally earned thereby. Under Malta's full-imputation system of taxation of dividends, the corporate tax is assimilated with the shareholder's personal income tax with respect to the dividend. In the shareholder's hands, the dividend is taxed at the gross amount, and the relevant amount of corporate tax offsets the shareholder's tax liability on income from all taxable sources with no further tax liability being imposed on the shareholder in respect of such dividends.
2. Interest and royalty income derived by non-residents is exempt from tax in Malta as long as certain conditions are complied with (e.g. they are not effectively connected to a PE of the recipient situated in Malta).
3. On the basis that Malta operates the full-imputation system of dividends, dividends are not subject to further tax when distributed by a company registered in Malta to a non-Maltese resident. Furthermore, if the rate provided under the Dividends Article in the respective treaty provides for a lower rate than the Maltese corporate tax rate incurred by the company on the respective profits (standard corporate tax rate of 35%), then this may result in a refund of Maltese tax in terms of Malta’s full imputation system (such a refund situation may arise in the treaties with Austria, Bulgaria, Kuwait, Libya, and Romania). In a number of treaties, the rate of deduction and of tax is reduced to 15% in the case of companies enjoying certain tax incentives. *See also Note 1 with respect to Malta’s full-imputation system of taxation of dividends.*
4. Distributions of dividends by a Maltese company where the dividend represents a distribution of untaxed income attracts a 15% WHT where the shareholder is (i) a Maltese resident other than a company, (ii) a non-resident person who is directly or indirectly owned and controlled by, or acts on behalf of, a Maltese domiciled and ordinarily-resident individual, or (iii) an EU/EEA individual who has declared that at least 90% of worldwide income is derived from Malta.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Social security contributions
For calendar year 2025, both the employer and the employee are each required to pay social security contributions at the rate of 10% of the individual employee’s salary and at fixed rates of EUR 54.43 per week for annual salaries exceeding EUR 28,303, provided the employee was born on or after 1 January 1962.
For self-occupied / self-employed individuals, social security contributions amount to 15% of the annual net income earned during the previous year. The maximum contribution for persons born on or after 1 January 1962 amounts to EUR 81.64.
All the rates are generally revised upwards at the start of every calendar year.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Supplies of goods and services in Malta are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 18%, although certain reduced rates apply in respect of specific goods/services.
Taxable persons whose economic activity consists principally in supplies of services and whose annual turnover is not higher than EUR 35,000 may qualify as small enterprises. If so, such persons are not required to charge VAT on their supplies, but they would still have a registration requirement (unless the services provided are exempt without credit supplies).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Malta.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Malta.
## Customs and excise duties
Other taxes imposed include customs and excise duties on certain goods. There is also a tax on air travel.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is applicable on certain documents and transfers, including transfers of immovable property and marketable securities (although certain exemptions may apply) and issues and renewals of insurance policies. Furthermore, in the event that the market value of shares held by a person is reduced following a change in the company's issued share capital or voting rights and the value shifts onto the other shareholders, the transferor would be deemed to have transferred the said value to the transferee(s), and such value shifting may be subject to a stamp duty liability (although certain exceptions/exemptions may apply).
In principle, stamp duty is imposed, *inter alia*, on heirs upon inheritance of immovable property at a rate of 5% and on shares in a Maltese company / interest in a Maltese partnership (not being a 'property company' or 'property partnership') at a rate of 2%. Stamp duty is also imposed on transmissions by death of immovable property situated in Malta and shares in Maltese companies. Certain exemptions from stamp duty may, however, apply in respect of such transmissions.
No stamp duty shall be charged on the first EUR 250,000 of donations of immovable property from parents to their children for the children’s residential purposes. The duty to be charged on the remaining value shall continue being charged at the reduced rate of 3.5%.
No stamp duty shall be charged on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value upon the acquisition of immovable property for their sole residence by first-time buyers, provided that the transfer is made by 31 December 2025.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, transfers of properties that had been leased to a tenant for a number of years under a scheme administered under the Housing Authority are not subject to stamp duty on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value. In cases where the exemption will not apply, a reduced rate of stamp duty may apply.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, where a person sells one's residential property so as to acquire another residential property and such person does not own other properties, the duty paid on the first EUR 86,000 of the value of the replacement property shall be refunded. This has been extended to acquisitions made up to 31 December 2025.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, transfers of immovable property that are made by 31 December 2025 are exempt from stamp duty on the first EUR 750,000 of the transfer value if:
The interest on duty on documents on transfers *causa mortis* amounts to 4% *per annum* or part thereof, which interest applies as from the lapse of one year from the date of such transfer, until the date when the necessary declaration is filed.
The interest rate on unpaid stamp duty is of 0.33% for every 30 days or part thereof, until the amount due remains unpaid.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, no duty is levied in the case of transfers of immovable property upon the devolution of a dwelling house to a surviving spouse/cohabitant, in the case of a transfer of immovable property upon death by a parent or legal guardian to a disabled individual, or in the case of a transfer of a dwelling house upon death by a parent to their descendants in the direct line.
In the case of the transfer by gratuitous title of (i) marketable securities owned by individuals and of (ii) commercial tenements (i.e. business property) that had been used in a family business for a minimum period of three years preceding the transfer, to the transferor’s spouse, descendants, and ascendants in the direct line and their spouses, or in the absence of descendants to such transferor’s siblings and their descendants, stamp duty chargeable is at a reduced rate of 1.5%. This reduced rate applicable to transfers by gratuitous title has been extended to 31 December 2024. Once this reduced rate is applied, no other exemption or duty relief should apply to such transfers.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
A company incorporated in Malta is considered as both domiciled and resident in Malta and is consequently taxable on a worldwide basis. A non-Maltese incorporated company that is resident in Malta through management and control is subject to Maltese tax on income arising in Malta and on income received in/remitted to Malta.
Companies are subject to income tax at a flat rate of 35%. There is no corporate tax structure separate from income tax.
## Petroleum profits tax
Petroleum profits tax is levied as income tax with similar deductions being allowed in respect of incurred expenditure. In the case of a Production Sharing Contract signed after 1 January 1996, any petroleum profits are taxed at the standard corporate tax rate of 35%. However, all other petroleum profits are subject to a 50% tax rate.
## Insurance profits tax
Insurance profits tax is levied as income tax and subject to the normal standard tax rate of 35% as other corporate profits; however, the manner in which such profits are ascertained is subject to a number of detailed rules that take into account the special nature of the insurance industry. In the case of non-resident companies, the computation is applied with reference only to business carried on in or from Malta.
Recently introduced rules on the taxation of insurance businesses adopting IFRS 17 came into effect from the year of assessment 2024 for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January  2023, which apply to insurers deriving gains or profits from the business of insurance. The rules regulate (i) the determination of total income based on adjusted profit before tax; (ii) the adoption gains or losses arising from the implementation of IFRS 17 and (iii) provide for an irrevocable option for insurers to spread the tax payment on the adoption gains equally over a maximum period of five consecutive years, subject to an election made by the insurer.
## Shipping profits tax
A tonnage tax system is applicable under Maltese law. Such regime covers profits from shipping activities as defined under the applicable regulations that are derived by qualifying Maltese-flagged and EU/European Economic Area (EEA) vessels as well as non-EU/EEA vessels satisfying certain additional rules. Furthermore, qualifying ship management activities are also entitled to the tonnage tax system.
The Maltese tonnage tax regulations allow the exemption of certain shipping income from being charged under income tax. These regulations provide that, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions, which conditions are modelled on the EU Community Guidelines on state aid to maritime transport, and the full payment of all relevant tonnage taxes by a shipping organisation, a shipping organisation shall not be charged further income tax on the income derived from shipping activities. Income derived from ship management activities may also qualify for the tonnage tax exemption. Furthermore, any further tax derived from income or profit gained from the sale or other transfer of a tonnage tax ship, which ship had been acquired and sold whilst under the tonnage tax system, or from the disposal of any rights to acquire a ship, which when delivered or completed would qualify as a tonnage tax ship, would be exempt.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Husband and wife (or two partners who have registered their partnership as a civil union) are jointly responsible for filing tax returns, and spouses must choose who between them is to be registered as the ‘responsible spouse’. Typically, the ‘responsible spouse’ cannot be changed before the lapse of five years. The responsible spouse may elect to have the tax on the other spouse's earned income/pension income computed separately. If a separate computation is chosen, husband and wife (or partners as aforesaid) are assessed separately at the single or the parents taxpayers' rates. Unearned income is taxable in the hands of the spouse/partner earning the higher level of income.
A couple that is married and living together may elect to receive a separate income tax return if both spouses earn employment, self-employment (excluding directors fees), or pension income from past employment, or they have an agreement of separation of assets.
The tax return, together with a self-assessment, must be submitted by the end of June of the year following the basis tax year. In certain instances and subject to the discretion of the Commissioner for Tax and Customs, an individual may not be required to file a tax return. In such instances, one should receive a statement from the Tax Authorities outlining one's tax position; if one does not agree with the position outlined in the said statement, one may then request a tax return and file it accordingly. Penalties are incurred on late filing of returns. The self-assessment is deemed to represent the correct tax position, and an assessment should not be raised unless the Commissioner for Tax and Customs disagrees with the self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
In terms of the Final Settlement System (FSS) Rules, an employer is required to withhold income tax and social security contributions at source from the employees’ salaries (including taxable fringe benefits), which, in most cases, equals the individual's total tax liability. Such deductions of tax/social security should be forwarded by the employer to the Commissioner for Tax and Customs within specific time frames.
Where income is not subject to the FSS (e.g. self-employed persons), the taxpayer is required to make three payments in the basis tax year under the provisional tax (PT) system. The PT payments are based on the last self-assessment filed by the individual, and the payments are divided into three instalments of 20%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. The tax liability that is still due at the tax return due date, after deducting all tax credits, must be settled immediately with the submission of the return. Payments of income tax due by 31 August onwards, which will not be paid by the due date, will be subject to interest at the rate of 0.6% (increased from 0.33%) per month or part thereof, until the tax remains unpaid. The total interest shall not exceed the amount of the tax due.
Tax refunds due by the Commissioner are subject to interest at the rate of 0.6% per month or part thereof from 1 September 2022.
Provisional tax is also payable at 7% on the selling price of certain assets disposed of on account of tax.
A final WHT of 15% is imposed on specified types of investment income (e.g. banking interest paid to Maltese residents), unless the taxpayer opts to be taxed at the tax rates applicable to him/her.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Malta, an archipelago located in the Mediterranean, became a British Crown Colony in the early 19th century and remained so until 21 September 1964, when it became an independent sovereign state. In 1974, Malta was declared a Republic. Malta is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. Soon after independence, Malta was admitted to the Council of Europe.
The mid-1980s saw the transformation of Malta into a flourishing economic hub. Malta began to be seen by the international community as an attractive freight trans-shipment point, financial centre, and tourist destination. The manufacturing industry also continued to expand. It was around this time when Malta began demonstrating interest in becoming a member of the European Community. Malta eventually joined the European Union (EU) in May 2004, and its adoption of the euro (EUR) took place a few years later, on 1 January 2008. The capital city of Malta is Valletta, and the official languages are Maltese and English.
The Maltese financial services industry is one of the faster growing sectors, taking advantage of a number of key attributes that Malta offers, including a highly-skilled workforce, excellent service, competence, technical infrastructure, and robust legislative and regulatory frameworks, including tax efficiency.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Malta taxes individuals who are both domiciled and ordinarily resident in Malta on their worldwide income.
Any person who is ordinarily resident in Malta but not domiciled in Malta is taxable only on income arising in Malta and on any foreign income remitted to Malta (i.e. on income and chargeable gains arising in Malta and on income outside Malta that is received in Malta). Such persons are not taxable in Malta on income arising outside Malta, which is not received in Malta, and on capital gains arising outside Malta, regardless of whether they are received in Malta, or otherwise.
However, persons who are married to an individual ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta are subject to a worldwide basis of taxation (and not on a source and remittance basis).
A non-resident individual is taxed only on income and chargeable gains arising in Malta.
Individuals are subject to tax on income arising in a calendar year (i.e. the basis year), which is assessed to tax in the year following the year in which it arises (i.e. the year of assessment).
## Personal income tax rates
Income is taxable at graduated progressive rates, ranging from 0% to 35%. The 35% tax bracket is reached at annual chargeable income in excess of EUR 60,000.
### Basis year 2025
Tax rates for basis tax year 2025 are as follows:
#### Married resident taxpayers
| Taxable income (EUR) | | Rate (%) | Deduct (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 15,000 | 0 | 0 |
| 15,001 | 23,000 | 15 | 2,250 |
| 23,001 | 60,000 | 25 | 4,550 |
| 60,001 | and above | 35 | 10,550 |
Subject to certain conditions, the married rates also apply to single parents, widows/widowers, and separated parents.
#### Single resident taxpayers (or married couples opting for a separate computation)
| Taxable income (EUR) | | Rate (%) | Deduct (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 12,000 | 0 | 0 |
| 12,001 | 16,000 | 15 | 1,800 |
| 16,001 | 60,000 | 25 | 3,400 |
| 60,001 | and above | 35 | 9,400 |
####
#### Parent rates
| Taxable income (EUR) | | Rate (%) | Deduct (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 13,000 | 0 | 0 |
| 13,001 | 17,500 | 15 | 1,950 |
| 17,501 | 60,000 | 25 | 3,700 |
| 60,001 | and above | 35 | 9,700 |
The parent rates can be claimed by individuals who maintain under their custody a child, or pay maintenance in respect of their child, where:
The parent rates provide more preferential tax bands in lieu of single/separate tax rates.
Individuals who in terms of Maltese tax laws are:
should be subject to a minimum tax in Malta of EUR 5,000 for the said year.
In calculating such minimum tax liability, any tax paid in terms of Maltese income tax law, whether by withholding or otherwise, should be taken into account, unless it is a final tax paid on the transfer of immovable property situated in Malta. The said minimum tax liability of EUR 5,000 should be calculated before double tax relief.
Taxpayers who calculate their income tax charge at the ‘single’ rates of tax; and during calendar year 2025 will only derive income from employment (other than income from the holding of an office of a director) that does not exceed EUR 12,050 (up from EUR 11,620), are to deduct €12,000 in arriving at their income chargeable to tax.
A reduced income tax rate of 7.5% applies in respect of income derived by registered professional football or water polo players, athletes, or licensed coaches. As of 2024, this shall be extended to other persons engaged in sports activities.
Artists receiving income from artistic activities (as defined) conducted on a self-employed basis may opt to be taxed at a flat rate of 7.5% on the first EUR 50,000 turnover earned. When this option is applied, the rest of the income is to be added to the main income and taxed at the progressive tax rates. The tax is final and no set-off or refund shall be granted.
Recipients of royalty income derived by an individual in one's capacity as an author from qualifying literary works may opt to tax the full gross amount of such royalty income at a reduced rate of 7.5% (decreased from 15%). The literary publication must be eligible for copyright in terms of the Maltese Copyright Act. The tax is final, no set-off or refund shall be granted, and it is payable by 30 April of the relative year of assessment.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, income derived from part-time work may qualify for a reduced tax rate of 10%, subject to a capping of EUR 10,000 *per annum* for part-time employment and EUR 12,000 *per annum* for part-time self-employment. Taxpayers may opt not to avail of this tax rate, in which case tax on such income should be charged at normal rates.
The income tax rate applicable on qualifying overtime emoluments remains 15% on the first EUR 10,000, provided that the basic weekly wage does not exceed EUR 375. Overtime emoluments exceeding this amount are taxable at the standard applicable rates of income tax.
Taxpayers subject to Maltese income tax on certain emoluments payable under a contract of employment requiring the performance of work or duties mainly outside Malta may opt to be subject to income tax at a flat rate of 15% if they satisfy certain conditions, including: (i) the said contract of employment should be for a period of at least 12 months and lasts at least 12 months, and (ii) the taxpayer should not be in Malta for a period that, in aggregate, is more than 30 days (disregarding vacation leave, sick leave, and period preceding commencement or following termination of contract).
Income tax rules have been issued in relation to third country nationals who hold a valid Nomad Residence Permit, which entitles the main applicant to work remotely from Malta. In terms of the said Rules, the main applicant is subject to income tax in Malta on income derived from ‘authorised work’ at a flat rate of 10%, before double tax relief (if applicable). Such income will be considered as the first part of the taxable income of the main applicant. Furthermore, generally, the main applicant is not subject to income tax in Malta on income arising from ‘authorised work’ in the first year. The maximum amount of non-taxable pension income increased from EUR 14,968 to EUR 16,220, with persons claiming married rates entitled to a further EUR 3,600 tax free in respect of income from other sources. These thresholds are available through the use of tax rebates on pension income after calculating the tax due using the normal rates on all income.
Certain pension income will gradually not be considered part of the taxable income, over a period of five years starting from 1 January 2022, as follows:
Moreover, for basis year 2025, tax rebate thresholds on pension income were increased as follows:
(a) Person taxed at the ‘single’ rates: (pension income less EUR 12,000) x 15%, capped at EUR 696;
(b) Person taxed at the ‘parent’ rates: (pension income less EUR 13,000) x 15%, capped at EUR 546;
(c) Person taxed at the ‘married’ rates:
i) (pension income less €15,000) x 15%, capped at €246;
ii) a further tax rebate is allowed against the tax on chargeable income, as follows: (all chargeable income less €15,000) x 15%, less rebate under (i) above, capped at €540.
As of 2024, widows’/widowers’/survivors' pension will no longer be taxable for individuals who have not attained 61 years of age. The beneficiaries will continue to be entitled to receive the pension income that would have been received by their spouse had they still been alive.
## Different types of programmes available for individuals
The Global Residence Programme is aimed at attracting more third country national individuals in taking up residence in Malta without taking up employment in Malta, with foreign-source income remitted to Malta by the beneficiary or its dependants being taxed at a flat rate of 15%, subject to a minimum tax of EUR 15,000 *per annum*. Beneficiaries should satisfy a number of qualifying criteria in order to be eligible for the beneficial tax treatment. In particular, applicants must hold immovable property in Malta for a purchase price of not less than EUR 275,000 (with lower thresholds applicable in the case of property situated in certain areas in Malta and/or Gozo). Alternatively, individuals may rent property in Malta for an annual rental payment of not less than EUR 9,600 (with lower thresholds applicable in the case of property situated in certain areas in Malta and/or Gozo).
The Residence Programme Rules 2014 (RPR) replaced the High Net Worth Individual Rules. The RPR reflects the same scheme as that provided under the Global Residence Program, but the former may be availed of by European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA)/Swiss nationals who are not permanent residents of Malta. Under the RPR, similar to the position under the Global Residence Programme Rules, any foreign income derived by beneficiaries or their dependants and remitted to Malta is taxed at the reduced rate of 15% (flat rate), subject to a minimum tax of EUR 15,000 *per annum*.
A Malta Retirement Programme is applicable to pensioners in receipt of periodic pension income. Such pension income must constitute at least 75% of the pensioner's chargeable income in Malta, and such pension must be received in Malta. A number of other statutory conditions apply in order to be eligible for the said programme. Again, under this programme, foreign-source remitted income is taxed at 15%, subject to a minimum tax liability of EUR 7,500 *per annum* and an additional EUR 500 per each dependant, *per annum*. This Programme is now extended to third country nationals.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, a returned migrant may elect to be taxed on a source and remittance basis (rather than on a world-wide basis). In this case, foreign-sourced income received in Malta exceeding the tax-free brackets of EUR 4,200 for single taxpayers and EUR 5,900 for married taxpayers should be subject to income tax at a flat rate of 15%, subject to a minimum tax liability of EUR 2,325 *per annum*.
The United Nations (UN) Pensions Programme Rules, 2015 are designed to attract foreign pensioners retiring from the United Nations. Similar to the Global Residence Programme and other programmes already in place, applicants must satisfy a number of conditions, including holding immovable property in Malta for a purchase price of not less than EUR 275,000, or EUR 220,000 for property situated in certain areas. Alternatively, individuals may rent property in Malta for an annual rental payment of not less than EUR 9,600, or EUR 8,750 for property situated in certain areas. A beneficiary who should receive at least 40% of the UN pension or a widow’s/widower’s benefit in Malta is not subject to income tax on such income in Malta. Other foreign-source remitted income should be taxed at a flat rate of 15%, subject to a minimum tax of EUR 10,000 (or EUR 15,000 where both spouses are in receipt of a UN Pension), after double tax relief.
The Highly Qualified Persons Rules cater to expatriates (i.e. individuals who are Maltese residents but not domiciled in Malta) in receipt of income payable in terms of a 'qualifying contract of employment' in respect of activities carried out in Malta. Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, such expatriates may be subject to tax on such income at a beneficial flat rate of 15%. The beneficial rate may be availed of by individuals occupying an 'eligible office' in financial services or gaming sectors or in undertakings holding an air operators certificate. These Rules also cover specific positions of employment in the sphere related to assisted reproductive technology.
Beneficiaries of the said rules may benefit from the reduced tax rate for a period of five years in the case of EEA and Swiss nationals and for a period of four years in the case of third country nationals. Furthermore, any person who is eligible to fall under the said Rules (irrespective of whether one has opted to benefit from the provisions of the said rules or otherwise), upon submitting an application, shall be eligible for two further extensions for the qualifying period, five years with respect to EEA and Swiss nationals and four years with respect to third-country nationals. Such extensions are subject to the continued adherence to the other provisions of the Rules and provided that the maximum qualifying period shall not exceed a consecutive period of 15 or 12 years, as the case may be.
In terms of the current rules, no determinations in terms of the Highly Qualified Persons Rules shall be issued by the competent authorities after 31 December 2025, and any such determination issued must refer to an employment in respect of which the benefit provided by these rules commences by not later than 31 December 2026 and ceases to apply by 31 December 2030. However, in the budget speech , the government committed to continue providing incentives to attract highly skilled workers and that such rules will also be extended to employees of entities providing back office services.
The Qualifying Employment in Aviation (Personal Tax) Rules were introduced with the aim of attracting EEA/Swiss and third country nationals not domiciled in Malta to hold an eligible office in the aviation sector in Malta. By virtue of these rules, eligible individuals may benefit from a beneficial tax rate of 15% on employment income from such activities, subject to receiving an annual income of at least EUR 45,000 and subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The beneficiary may avail of this arrangement for five consecutive years from when one is first liable to income tax in Malta, with the possibility to apply for two extensions of five years each, provided that the eligibility under these rules should not exceed a consecutive period of 15 years.
Beneficiaries in receipt of employment income from a qualifying employment in maritime activities and the servicing of offshore oil and gas industry activities may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, opt to be taxed on such income at a flat rate of 15%. The qualifying contract of employment should give rise to a minimum salary (excluding fringe benefits) of EUR 65,000 in respect of a year of assessment.
In terms of the Qualifying Employment in Innovation and Creativity Rules, beneficiaries in receipt of employment income from a qualifying contract under these Rules may opt to be taxed on such income at a flat rate of 15%. The qualifying contract of employment should give rise to a minimum salary (excluding fringe benefits) of EUR 52,000 in respect of a year of assessment. The beneficiary may avail of this arrangement for four consecutive years from when one is first liable to income tax in Malta, with the possibility to apply for an extension of five years.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Social security contributions
For calendar year 2025, both the employer and the employee are each required to pay social security contributions at the rate of 10% of the individual employee’s salary and at fixed rates of EUR 54.43 per week for annual salaries exceeding EUR 28,303, provided the employee was born on or after 1 January 1962.
For self-occupied / self-employed individuals, social security contributions amount to 15% of the annual net income earned during the previous year. The maximum contribution for persons born on or after 1 January 1962 amounts to EUR 81.64.
All the rates are generally revised upwards at the start of every calendar year.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Supplies of goods and services in Malta are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 18%, although certain reduced rates apply in respect of specific goods/services.
Taxable persons whose economic activity consists principally in supplies of services and whose annual turnover is not higher than EUR 35,000 may qualify as small enterprises. If so, such persons are not required to charge VAT on their supplies, but they would still have a registration requirement (unless the services provided are exempt without credit supplies).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Malta.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Malta.
## Customs and excise duties
Other taxes imposed include customs and excise duties on certain goods. There is also a tax on air travel.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is applicable on certain documents and transfers, including transfers of immovable property and marketable securities (although certain exemptions may apply) and issues and renewals of insurance policies. Furthermore, in the event that the market value of shares held by a person is reduced following a change in the company's issued share capital or voting rights and the value shifts onto the other shareholders, the transferor would be deemed to have transferred the said value to the transferee(s), and such value shifting may be subject to a stamp duty liability (although certain exceptions/exemptions may apply).
In principle, stamp duty is imposed, *inter alia*, on heirs upon inheritance of immovable property at a rate of 5% and on shares in a Maltese company / interest in a Maltese partnership (not being a 'property company' or 'property partnership') at a rate of 2%. Stamp duty is also imposed on transmissions by death of immovable property situated in Malta and shares in Maltese companies. Certain exemptions from stamp duty may, however, apply in respect of such transmissions.
No stamp duty shall be charged on the first EUR 250,000 of donations of immovable property from parents to their children for the children’s residential purposes. The duty to be charged on the remaining value shall continue being charged at the reduced rate of 3.5%.
No stamp duty shall be charged on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value upon the acquisition of immovable property for their sole residence by first-time buyers, provided that the transfer is made by 31 December 2025.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, transfers of properties that had been leased to a tenant for a number of years under a scheme administered under the Housing Authority are not subject to stamp duty on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value. In cases where the exemption will not apply, a reduced rate of stamp duty may apply.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, where a person sells one's residential property so as to acquire another residential property and such person does not own other properties, the duty paid on the first EUR 86,000 of the value of the replacement property shall be refunded. This has been extended to acquisitions made up to 31 December 2025.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, transfers of immovable property that are made by 31 December 2025 are exempt from stamp duty on the first EUR 750,000 of the transfer value if:
The interest on duty on documents on transfers *causa mortis* amounts to 4% *per annum* or part thereof, which interest applies as from the lapse of one year from the date of such transfer, until the date when the necessary declaration is filed.
The interest rate on unpaid stamp duty is of 0.33% for every 30 days or part thereof, until the amount due remains unpaid.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, no duty is levied in the case of transfers of immovable property upon the devolution of a dwelling house to a surviving spouse/cohabitant, in the case of a transfer of immovable property upon death by a parent or legal guardian to a disabled individual, or in the case of a transfer of a dwelling house upon death by a parent to their descendants in the direct line.
In the case of the transfer by gratuitous title of (i) marketable securities owned by individuals and of (ii) commercial tenements (i.e. business property) that had been used in a family business for a minimum period of three years preceding the transfer, to the transferor’s spouse, descendants, and ascendants in the direct line and their spouses, or in the absence of descendants to such transferor’s siblings and their descendants, stamp duty chargeable is at a reduced rate of 1.5%. This reduced rate applicable to transfers by gratuitous title has been extended to 31 December 2024. Once this reduced rate is applied, no other exemption or duty relief should apply to such transfers.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Taxable period
The year of assessment is a calendar year, but a company may obtain authorisation from the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs to have a different year-end (i.e. other than 31 December).
## Tax returns
An income tax return for income earned during the previous year must be filed for every year of assessment. The tax return for a company must be submitted by the later of nine months following the end of the financial year or by 31 March following the year of assessment (however, in recent years, the Commissioner for Tax and Customs has provided concessionary extensions to such statutory deadlines in the case where the tax return is submitted electronically). Penalties are incurred on late filing of returns. The tax return submitted by the company is a self-assessment, and the Commissioner for Tax and Customs will not raise an assessment unless the Commissioner is not in agreement with the self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
Companies are charged tax in the currency in which their share capital is denominated.
During the basis tax year, a company is generally required to make provisional tax (PT) payments every four months. In general, the PT payments are based on the last self-assessment filed by the company, and payments are divided into three instalments of 20%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. Any tax liability that is still due at the tax return date after deducting all tax credits must be settled immediately with the submission of the return. Following a recent legislative change, interest at 0.6% per month (or part thereof) is charged on any unpaid tax that is payable on or after 31 August 2022 (immediately before such date, interest was at 0.33%).
In certain instances, especially for companies with a high percentage of business interests outside Malta, PT may not be payable, and the tax payment is normally paid on the earlier of the date profits are distributed or 18 months after the end of the relevant accounting period.
## Tax audit process
## Statute of limitations
An assessment may be issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs no later than five years from the end of the year in which the tax return is filed. In the event of non-full disclosure or wilful incorrect/misleading information, the aforesaid prescription period will not apply.
In respect of the payment of tax, additional tax, interest, or any penalty, an action may be taken during any time from the date on which it becomes due and payable up to eight years from that date or, where an assessment in respect thereof has been made, from the date on which that assessment becomes final and conclusive.
The Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs follows international tax developments closely and is also involved in discussions and representations on such matters in various fora.

# Malta
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Exports of goods to countries outside the European Union, food (as defined) for human consumption, and numerous financial services (as defined) are exempt from VAT. Some of these exempt supplies also give the supplier a right to claim an input tax credit of VAT incurred on purchases made during the course of such supplies.
For a number of years now, the place of supply of telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic services to non-taxable persons is considered to be the place where that non-taxable person is established, has one's permanent address, or where one usually resides. As of 1 January 2019, this is not applicable if the supplier is only established in Malta and the total value of the services supplied to a non-taxable person established in any other member state other than Malta does not exceed 10,000 euros (EUR) in the same calendar year. As of 1 January 2021, this threshold includes supplies of distance sales made in other EU member state (*see* *E-commerce changes below*).
### Quick fixes
In line with an EU-wide initiative, a number of ‘quick fixes’ are incorporated into Maltese VAT legislation with the intention of improving the day-to-day functioning of the VAT system for EU cross-border business-to-business (B2B) trade, particularly where goods are concerned. These ‘quick fixes’:
### E-commerce changes
As part of the e-commerce changes, VAT regulations for business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce apply. These regulations will impact online sellers (particularly if they would be selling more than EUR 10,000 of goods in an EU member state other than the one in which they are established), operators of online market platforms, couriers, and the end consumers themselves (as there may be changes to the VAT that would need to be levied on a given transaction). These changes also include a number of provisions that concern distance sales, such as the following:
### Small undertakings
A  small undertaking may avail of a simplified VAT registration (referred to as an Article 11 VAT Registration) with a reduced compliance burden. This type of registration is now no longer limited to transactions taking place only in Malta but may also cover some transactions in other EU Member States (provided that, *inter alia,* the relevant thresholds have not been exceeded). Entities established outside of Malta may also avail of such a VAT registration if the transactions taking place in Malta are below the applicable threshold.
### Brexit
### Other recent changes
Pursuant to a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the local VAT authorities have reiterated that, where a company is being remunerated for making available to another company the services of a Director, this would, in fact, constitute an economic activity that falls within the scope of VAT.
There has also been a renewed focus (including an increase in late-filing penalties) on compliance with filing obligations for ancillary declarations, such as with the timely submissions of recapitulative statements (referred to as EC Sales Lists in some jurisdictions). A similar focus is being placed by the authorities on the timely submission of IntraStat declarations.
Likewise, there has also been an increase in late-payment interest to 0.6% per month (or part thereof) that a VAT payable balance remains outstanding.
In accordance with recent VAT updates, payment service providers are required to keep sufficiently detailed information in accordance with the specification set out in the said regulations of at least 25 separate cross-border transactions and the payees making such payments. Furthermore, such records are to be submitted to the VAT Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of Title V of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, thus enabling the Maltese VAT authorities to monitor the supply of goods and services and combat VAT fraud.
With effect from 1 January 2025,  where certain services are streamed or otherwise made virtually available, the  place of supply of these services shall be the place where the non-taxable person is  established,  has  his  permanent  address  or  usually resides.
## Customs duties
Goods imported from outside the European Union may be subject to customs duties. A Customs Code provides for customs procedures and concepts, which are based on European Community requirements.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are chargeable on certain energy products, certain alcoholic drinks, certain manufactured tobacco products, and mobile telephony services.
## Property taxes
Maltese tax legislation does not contain any wealth taxes or other similar taxes on property, save for the property transfers tax outlined below.
## Property transfer taxes
Transfers of immovable property situated in Malta are generally subject to a final withholding tax (WHT), which, in most cases, is charged on the transfer value of the property. In the case of transfers of Maltese immovable property made on or after 1 January 2015, the WHT on such transfer should, in general, be 8% or 10% (the latter rate applying in the case where the property was acquired before 1 January 2004). Certain other rates of WHT may apply in specific circumstances.
The final tax rate on transfers of immovable property situated in urban conservation areas, whereby the transferor had declared that one has carried out works on that property in compliance with a permit issued by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) providing for the restoration and/or rehabilitation of that property, is set at 5% of the transfer value, subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions.
Transfers of immovable property acquired through *causa mortis* or donation may be taxed at 12% WHT on the difference between transfer value and acquisition value. Taxpayers can opt out of this mechanism and have the transfer taxed at the default rate on the transfer value as set out above.
The first EUR 100,000 of any profits or gains arising on the assignment or cessation of any rights acquired under a promise of transfer of immovable property or any rights thereon will be subject to a tax at the rate of 15%.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is charged on, among other transactions, transfers of immovable property (5% for both residents and non-residents) and marketable securities (2%; 5% in the case of transfers of shares in property companies). Persons who are subject to duty in terms of Maltese law should now be registered with the Commissioner for Revenue.
The exemption from duty on the restructuring of holdings through mergers, demergers, amalgamations, and re-organisations within a group of companies also applies to partnerships. As a result, no duty should be chargeable on the exchange of a partnership interest for shares from one company to another where the transferor and the transferee form part of the same group of companies. In addition, no duty shall be chargeable on the transfer of a partnership interest for consideration from a company or partnership to another company or partnership. This shall apply where the transferor and the transferee form part of the same group of companies, or where any or both of them are partnerships, and they would have been considered to form part of the same group if they had been a company or companies.
In the case of the transfer by gratuitous title of (i) marketable securities owned by individuals and of (ii) commercial tenements (i.e. business property) that had been used in a family business for a minimum period of three years preceding the transfer, to the transferor’s spouse, descendants, and ascendants in the direct line and their spouses, or in the absence of descendants to such transferor’s brothers or sisters and their descendants, stamp duty is chargeable at a reduced rate of 1.5%. The 1.5% reduced stamp duty rate only applies if the donation is made by public deed and is made prior to 1 January 2026. Once this reduced rate is applied, no other exemption or duty relief will apply to such transfers.
In the event that the market value of shares held by a person is reduced following a change in the company’s issued share capital or voting rights and the value shifts onto the other shareholders, the transferor would be deemed to have transferred the said value to the transferee(s) and such value shifting may be subject to a stamp duty liability (although certain exceptions/exemptions may apply).
Maltese legislation also provides for the possibility of a stamp duty exemption in a number of instances, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Some of the more commonly availed of exemptions include the acquisition or disposal of marketable securities by or in the following: (i) licensed collective investment schemes; (ii) licensed persons providing management, administration, safekeeping, or investment advice to collective investment schemes; (iii) companies being owned more than 50% by non-Maltese residents and satisfying certain other conditions; and (iv) a company being owned more than 50% by non-Maltese residents and that carries on or intends to carry on more than 90% of its business outside of Malta.
A stamp duty exemption should also apply (subject to certain conditions) in instances where there is a transfer of partnership interest.
## Payroll taxes
In terms of the Final Settlement System (FSS) rules, an employer is required to withhold income tax and social security contributions (*see below*) at source from the employees’ salaries. Such deductions of tax/social security should be forwarded by the employer to the Malta Tax and Customs Administration within specific time frames.
## Employer's social security contributions
Employers are required to pay social security contributions at the rate of 10% of the individual employee’s salary and at fixed rates, for calendar year 2025, of EUR 54.43  per week for annual salaries equal to or exceeding EUR 28,303.08, in the case where the employee is born on or after 1 January 1962 (it should be noted that the employee is also required to pay an equivalent weekly amount).
The rates of social security generally increase annually and take effect from the commencement of the calendar year in question.
### Salaried persons
Social security contributions amount to 10% of the employee’s basic weekly wage, payable by both the employee and the employer, subject to a minimum and maximum contribution. The maximum contribution varies depending on the age of the insured person as follows:
### Self-employed/Self-occupied persons
Social security contributions amount to 15% of the self-employed/self-occupied person’s annual net income earned during the previous year and are also subject to a minimum and maximum contribution. The maximum contribution varies depending on the age of the person as follows:

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
All companies incorporated in Malta are considered to be both domiciled and resident in Malta. Other bodies of persons (including companies incorporated overseas) are considered to be resident in Malta when the control and management of their business are exercised in the country.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Although Maltese tax legislation contains a number of references to the term ‘permanent establishment’, the term is not defined by Maltese legislation. Indeed, in terms of Maltese domestic tax law, a non-resident is, in principle, subject to Maltese tax on income arising in Malta, irrespective of the existence or otherwise of a PE in Malta (subject to any double tax treaty [DTT] provisions that would apply if in conflict with Maltese tax law).
In the event that the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs is required to interpret such a term, reference would typically be made to the definition contained in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Convention.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
The basic condition for deductibility of expenses is that deductions are allowable only with respect to expenditures that are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of income.
In order to be in a position to claim a tax deduction, a valid tax invoice/other equivalent document sustaining the expense may have to be provided if requested by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs.
Apart from the general tax deductibility rule stated above, the Maltese Income Tax Act also provides a number of exceptions whereby specific expenses of a capital nature may also be tax deductible, subject to the satisfaction of the statutory conditions applicable thereto. The following are some further comments on specific items of expenditure.
## Depreciation and depletion
Tax depreciation is computed on the straight-line method. The rate of depreciation on plant and machinery varies according to the category of the plant and machinery in question.
Maltese tax law prescribes the minimum number of years over which items of plant and machinery are to be depreciated as follows:
| Category | Years |
| --- | --- |
| Computers and electronic equipment | 4 |
| Computer software | 4 |
| Motor vehicles | 5 |
| Furniture, fixtures, fittings, and soft furnishings | 10 |
| Equipment used for constructions of buildings and excavation | 6 |
| Catering equipment | 6 |
| Aircraft - aircraft airframe | 4 |
| Aircraft - engines | 4 |
| Aircraft - engine or airframe overhaul | 4 |
| Aircraft - interiors and other parts | 4 |
| Ships and vessels | 10 |
| Electrical and plumbing installations and sanitary fittings | 15 |
| Cable infrastructure | 20 |
| Pipeline infrastructure | 20 |
| Communications and broadcasting equipment | 6 |
| Medical equipment | 6 |
| Lifts and escalators | 10 |
| Air conditioners | 6 |
| Equipment mainly designed or used for the production of water or electricity | 6 |
| Other machinery | 5 |
| Other plant | 10 |
The wear and tear rate on industrial buildings and structures (including hotels, car parks, and offices) may not exceed 2% *per annum*. New acquisitions of industrial buildings and structures are entitled to a concurrent extra 10% allowance in the year of acquisition. Tax depreciation is not required to conform to book depreciation.
The total allowances over the asset’s useful life may not exceed 100% of its cost. If a surplus arises on disposal of a tax-depreciated asset, it is either added to the year’s income or utilised to reduce the cost of any replacement. If the asset has been under-depreciated, a balancing allowance is granted.
No deduction is available for the depletion of natural resources.
The rules on tax deductions for wear and tear of plant and machinery provide for certain specific treatment in particular situations, including, among other things, the following:
## Intellectual property (IP)
Maltese tax law provides for a tax deduction for expenditure of a capital nature on IP or any IP rights incurred in the production of income. Such expenditure should be tax deductible over the life of the relevant IP but, in any case, over a minimum period of three consecutive years. As of the financial year 2023, such expenditure of a capital nature on IP/ IP rights may, at the option of the taxpayer, be deducted in full in the year in which the expenditure is incurred or in the year in which the IP/ IP rights are first used or employed in producing the income. Subject to certain conditions, a proportion of the excess may be carried forward for deduction against qualifying income in future years.
Malta also has in place a Patent Box Regime. These Rules provide for a deduction in relation to qualifying income derived from 'qualifying IP' on or after 1 January 2019. The Rules have been drafted in a manner so as to be compliant with the OECD modified nexus approach and the EU Code of Conduct on Business Taxation.
'Qualifying IP' includes patents and utility models, software, and IP assets relating to medical products. In order for a significant proportion of IP income to qualify for benefits, a significant proportion of the actual R&D activities must have been undertaken by the qualifying taxpayer itself. The beneficiaries in such circumstances would be the owners of the qualifying IP or the holder of an exclusive licence in respect of the qualifying IP. The Patent Box Regime deduction is calculated based on a formula and subject to satisfying a number of conditions.
## Goodwill
In the event that goodwill were to fall within the purport of IP for the purposes of the tax deductibility rules under Maltese tax law, then it may possibly be argued that an expenditure on goodwill may be tax deductible. However, this would need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis.
## Start-up expenses
Certain pre-trading expenses (i.e. staff training, advertising, salaries/wages) are also allowed as a deduction, subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:
1. The expenditure is incurred not more than 18 months before the commencement of the trade or business.
2. The expenditure is not deductible in ascertaining the trading or business income of the person carrying on such trade or business but would have been so deductible under (i) above had it been incurred after that time.
In the event that the above conditions are satisfied, such expenditure is treated as incurred on the day on which the trade or business is first carried on by the person.
## Interest expenses
Interest on any borrowed money is an allowable deduction if it is paid on capital employed in acquiring income. The expense is allowable even though the borrowing would have been made for a capital purpose. This special rule is in addition to the deduction for interest paid on money due on revenue account (such interest should be deductible under the general rule of deductibility), such as interest on trade debts or charged on normal business overdraft facilities. There is a restriction in respect of interest deductibility where the relevant advance is in connection with the financing of Maltese immovable property and subject to certain other conditions.
As of 1 January 2019, interest limitation rules were introduced that reflect the provisions set out under the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). These rules set a cap on the amount of interest tax deductions that may be availed of. The limit applies with respect to borrowing costs that exceed interest income. This is capped at 30% of tax-adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). It should be noted that no capping applies where exceeding borrowing costs fall below EUR 3 million. Maltese application of the directive provides for a grandfathering clause, meaning that loans that were concluded before 17 June 2016 fall out of the scope of the directive.
Where a taxpayer forms part of a group, the taxpayer may, subject to certain conditions, fully deduct exceeding borrowing costs if it can demonstrate that the ratio of its equity to its assets is equal to or higher than that of the group of which it forms part.
There are also derogations to the interest limitation rule, such as standalone entities (i.e. companies that are not part of a group for financial accounting purposes, that are not associated enterprises or PE’s), certain types of financial companies, such as credit institutions, and long-term infrastructure projects.
If borrowing costs are exceeded during one year and cannot be fully deducted, they may be carried forward without limitation. If, on the other hand, the allowed interest capacity is not fully used, this can be carried forward for a period of five years.
## Bad debt
Bad debts incurred in any trade, business, profession, or vocation are allowed in the year they become bad if proved to the satisfaction of the tax authorities. No deduction is given for provisions for bad debts and for bad debts incurred in activities other than a trade, business, profession, or vocation. Any bad debt that is later recovered is deemed as income for the year in which it is received.
## Charitable contributions
The general rule is that charitable contributions are not deductible for Maltese tax purposes unless expressly provided for by law.
## Fines and penalties
The general rule is that fines and penalties are not deductible for Maltese tax purposes.
## Taxes
Technically, taxes suffered should not be deductible for Maltese tax purposes. However, the typical interpretation of the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs is that as long as no relief of double taxation is claimed for the tax, then such tax should be available as a tax deduction.
## Other significant items
1. Double deduction (DD), which refers to a deduction of the same payment, expenses, or losses in the jurisdiction in which the payment has its source, the expenses are incurred, or the losses are suffered (payer jurisdiction) and in another jurisdiction (investor jurisdiction). Anti-hybrid legislation aims to neutralise the mismatch primarily by denying the deduction in the investor jurisdiction or, if the deduction is not denied in the investor jurisdiction, such deduction shall be denied in the payer jurisdiction. However, any such deduction shall be eligible to be set-off against dual inclusion income whether arising in a current or a subsequent tax period (i.e. income that is included under the laws of both jurisdictions where the mismatch outcome has arisen).
2. Deduction without inclusion (D/NI), which refers to a deduction of a payment (or deemed payment between the head office and PE or between two or more PEs) in any jurisdiction in which that payment (or deemed payment) is treated as made (payer jurisdiction) without a corresponding inclusion for tax purposes of that payment (or deemed payment) in the payee jurisdiction. A measure to neutralise the hybrid mismatch is that such deduction shall be denied in the payer jurisdiction. On the other hand, if the deduction is not denied in the payer jurisdiction, the amount of the payment that would otherwise give rise to a mismatch outcome shall be included as taxable income in the payee jurisdiction.
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely until absorbed. There is no carryback of losses, even in terminal years. Unabsorbed capital allowances may be carried forward only against the same underlying source of income. Where the source ceases to exist, any remaining balance of unabsorbed capital allowances is lost.
Certain rules apply in relation to the discretion of the Commissioner for Tax and Customs to allow tax losses/capital allowances to be taken over by the surviving company following a merger/division.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no restrictions on the deductibility of royalties and interest (except for interest, discount, or premium that are in any manner connected to Maltese immovable property and subject to the satisfaction of certain other statutory conditions, in which case, the interest/discount/premium should not be tax deductible in Malta). As of 1 January 2019, one also needs to consider the ATAD provisions on interest deductibility and service fees paid to foreign affiliates as long as the particular expenses are considered to be incurred in the production of the particular income and satisfy the applicable statutory conditions. Interest, discount, premium, or royalties derived by non-residents are exempt from Maltese tax, subject to the applicable statutory requirements.
## Notional interest deduction (NID)
The NID is calculated by multiplying the deemed notional interest rate by the balance of risk capital that the undertaking has at year-end. The undertaking shall be entitled to a deduction for sums that are deemed to be payable by way of interest on risk capital or such part thereof as may be determined by the undertaking for the particular year. The notional interest rate is the risk-free rate set on Malta Government Stocks with a remaining term of approximately 20 years plus a premium of 5%. The risk capital of the undertaking includes mainly share capital, share premium, reserves, and interest-free loans as at year-end. The NID may also be claimed by a Maltese PE of a non-Maltese resident undertaking. In that case, the risk capital is taken to be the capital attributable to the PE.
The maximum deduction in any given year cannot exceed 90% of chargeable income, and any excess can then be carried forward to the following year. Certain anti-avoidance rules apply to prevent abuses of the NID.

# Malta
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Two companies that for tax purposes are resident exclusively in Malta, where one company is a 50% plus subsidiary of the other or both are 50% plus subsidiaries of a third Malta-resident company, qualify as members of a group of companies. Allowable losses may be surrendered by a company to another company within the group where both companies have concurrent accounting periods and form part of such group throughout the entire basis year for which this relief is claimed.
## Consolidated Group (Income Tax) Rules
In relation to accounting periods commencing in calendar year 2019 and subsequent years, there is the possibility of income tax consolidation in Malta.
Consequently, companies forming part of a group of companies (as defined) may elect to be treated as one single taxpayer (subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions). This would be achieved by allowing a parent company to elect that its subsidiary/ies and itself will form a fiscal unit, resulting in the subsidiary/ies being treated as transparent.
As a result, upon successful registration, the parent company would be considered the ‘principal taxpayer’ of the fiscal unit, and the chargeable income of the members of the fiscal unit would be taxable solely in the hands of such principal taxpayer. Furthermore, transactions taking place between persons forming part of the fiscal unit (excluding transfers of immovable property situated in Malta subject to a final tax) are disregarded and fall outside the scope of Maltese income tax legislation.
The primary conditions to be satisfied for a successful registration are that:
The Legal Notice also establishes other requirements that will need to be satisfied to establish a fiscal unit.
## Transfer pricing
On 18 November 2022, Transfer Pricing rules (“the Rules”) were introduced in Malta.
The Rules apply to basis years commencing on or after 1 January 2024, with respect to arrangements entered into on or after 1 January 2024, and any arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2024 that are materially altered on or after that date.
As from 01 January 2027, the Rules will also apply to any arrangements entered into before 01 January 2024 and which were not materially altered after 01 January 2024.
Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are excluded from the scope of the Rules (i.e. those entities fulfilling the criteria laid down in Annex I of Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014).
The Rules apply to cross-border arrangements entered into between associated enterprises. Any transactions between Maltese-resident entities are excluded from the scope of the Rules. Securitisation transactions are also excluded from the scope of the Rules. The Rules will also not apply where the aggregate arm’s length value of all items of income and expenditure of:
in the year preceding the year of assessment.
Bodies of persons that should be considered as associated enterprises for the purposes of the Rules include enterprises over which there is direct or indirect control through a holding of more than 75% of the voting rights or ordinary share capital, or alternatively, by virtue of any powers conferred by the articles of association or other document regulating the controlled body of persons. Bodies of persons subject to common control by virtue of the 75% threshold will also fall within the scope of the Rules.
Where bodies of persons are constituent entities of a multinational enterprise group, and thus subject to country-by-country reporting obligations, the percentage interest in the voting rights or the ordinary share capital will be of 50% (rather than 75%).
For the purpose of the Rules, cross-border arrangements should include the following arrangements:
-An arrangement between a Maltese-resident company and a non-Maltese-resident party;
-An arrangement between a Maltese-resident company and a permanent establishment situated outside Malta to which the arrangement is effectively connected; and
-An arrangement between a company that maintains a permanent establishment in Malta to which the arrangement is effectively connected, or otherwise derives income or gains arising in Malta, and a non-Maltese resident party.
In terms of the Guidelines in relation to the Transfer Pricing Rules, issued by the Maltese Tax and Customs Administration (MTCA), the methodologies set out in Chapter II of the OECD TP Guidelines are the preferred methodologies to determine the arm’s length price. Other methods may also be accepted in accordance with the OECD TP Guidelines.
Furthermore, the documentation that is required to be held by entities which fall within scope of such Rules, shall be in line with Chapter V of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (i.e. Master File and Local File).
The Rules also set out a framework for the request and issuance of unilateral transfer pricing rulings and advance pricing agreements.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The CbC reporting requirement applies to MNE groups, being any group that includes two or more enterprises (including any PEs) the tax residence of which falls in two different jurisdictions, in respect of fiscal years starting on or after 1 January 2016. The Regulations apply for MNE groups having a total consolidated group revenue of at least EUR 750 million (or an equivalent amount in local currency) during the fiscal year immediately preceding the reporting year.
## Public country-by-country reporting (Public CbCR)
The EU’s Public CbCR Directive was transposed into Maltese legislation on 17 May 2024. The Public CbCR will take effect in Malta for accounting periods beginning on or after 22 June 2024.
MNE groups based in the EU/EEA and non-EU based MNEs doing business in the EU/EEA through a branch or subsidiary with a consolidated annual revenue of at least EUR 750 million for two consecutive years fall within the scope of the Directive.
## Thin capitalisation
The Maltese tax regime does not contain thin capitalisation rules. However, reference should be made to the interest limitation rules set out *under Interest expenses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
As a result of the transposition of the ATAD into Maltese legislation, Malta introduced the concept of CFC legislation into Maltese tax law and such legislation became effective as of 1 January 2019.
A CFC is defined in the Regulations as:
1. an entity in which a Maltese resident taxpayer, alone or together with its associated enterprises, holds a direct or indirect participation of more than 50% of the voting rights, or owns directly or indirectly more than 50% of the capital or is entitled to receive more than 50% of the profits of that entity, and
2. the actual corporate tax paid by the entity is lower than the difference between the tax that would have been charged on the entity under the Income Tax Acts and the actual foreign corporate tax paid.
A CFC also includes the PE situated outside Malta of a Maltese resident taxpayer where the condition set out in paragraph (ii) applies.
Where an entity/PE is considered to be a CFC, the Regulations require the non-distributed income of the CFC arising from non-genuine arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage to be included in the tax base of the Maltese resident entity.
The Regulations (in line with the ATAD) provide that an arrangement or a series thereof are to be regarded as non-genuine to the extent that the entity or PE would not own the assets or would not have undertaken the risks that generate all, or part of, its income if it were not controlled by a company where the significant people functions, which are relevant to those assets and risks, are carried out in Malta and are instrumental in generating the controlled company's income.
The Regulations also provide for the manner and amount of CFC profit to be included in the tax base of the Malta resident entity.
CFCs whose profits fall within certain minimum thresholds are excluded from the application of this regulation.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
The tax rate on branch income for branches set up in Malta is the same as that for Maltese resident companies. Other than the tax charged on a branch's income, no tax is withheld on transfers of profits to the head office.

# Malta
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
## Inbound investment
Investments by foreigners may be readily repatriated together with profits.
As of 1 January 2020, one would need to take into consideration the new provisions for exit taxation under Maltese tax law introduced in line with the adoption of the ATAD provisions.
In terms of these exit tax provisions, with effect from 1 January 2020, a taxpayer may be subject to tax on capital gains where assets are owned by the taxpayer and are transferred outside the Maltese income tax net in the following circumstances:
In the circumstances outlined above, the taxpayer is deemed to have transferred those assets and may be considered to have derived a capital gain. The capital gain is calculated by reference to an amount equal to the market value of the transferred assets, at the time of exit of the assets, less their base cost for tax purposes.
The income tax that may become chargeable on the deemed transfer becomes payable by not later than the taxpayer’s subsequent tax return date. This said, the payment may, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, be deferred by paying it in instalments over five years.
## Incentives for inbound investment
The Malta Enterprise Act and other related legislation provide a comprehensive package of incentives for inbound investment. These incentives are reserved for enterprises carrying on certain activities in Malta, mainly manufacturing activities. The focus is on high-value-added activities, and pre-approval of a project’s eligibility for benefits by Malta Enterprise may be required. In general, eligibility does not depend on whether the company produces for the local or export markets. The main tax incentives include the following:
The combination of certain tax treaties and Maltese domestic law lowers the Maltese tax rate on certain companies receiving certain industrial assistance (i.e. mainly assistance in terms of the Malta Enterprise Act, Business Promotion Act, and Business Promotion Regulations) to 15%.
A number of other schemes administered by Malta Enterprise (e.g. Business Development Scheme, Smart and Sustainable Investment Grant Scheme, Start-Up Finance Scheme, Green Mobility Scheme etc) cater to undertakings operating in a number of industries and may provide tax benefits to the eligible undertakings.
In addition, the Seed Investment Scheme (Income Tax) Rules offer tax relief to start-ups with the aim of encouraging access to finance to SMEs. In terms of these rules, ‘qualifying investors’ should be entitled to a tax credit amounting to 35% of the aggregate value of their investment in qualifying companies (total tax credit not exceeding EUR 250,000 *per annum*). Such tax credit would be set off against the tax due by the qualifying investor in respect of any income or gains brought to charge to tax in the year of assessment following the basis year when the investments are made. The tax credit may be carried forward until it is fully absorbed. In addition, qualifying investors may be entitled to an exemption from tax in respect of any gains or profits derived from the disposal of their qualifying investments, where such investments are disposed of after the lapse of three years from the date of subscription to the equity shares.
Malta Enterprise, throughout the past few years, launched various schemes and incentives, including:
### Start in Malta
### Start-Up Residence Permit
As part of the Start in Malta initiative, the Malta Start-up Residence Programme grants a three-year residence permit (which may be extended for an additional five years), which entitles non-EU nationals to reside in Malta while launching a start-up venture. Enterprises qualifying for this programme need to have been registered for not more than seven years, and a tangible investment of EUR 25,000, which increases to EUR 35,000 in case the enterprise involves more than four founders, is required to be made.
## International business profits
Other Maltese tax considerations that may be relevant in an international business context include the following:
## Other tax credits
A tax credit for micro enterprises is provided under the Micro Invest Scheme. The credit amounts to 45% (or 65% for undertakings operating in Gozo) of eligible capital expenditure and/or wage costs incurred, which tax credit would then be utilised against the tax incurred on income derived from the qualifying trade or business activity for that financial year, subject to certain maximum limits applied over three consecutive fiscal years.
The applicant undertaking cannot employ more than 50 full-time employees, and the maximum eligible tax credits per single undertaking is EUR 50,000 over any period of three consecutive fiscal years. This maximum credit is further increased to EUR 70,000 in respect of undertakings operating in Gozo, family businesses, and female-owned undertakings. Certain cappings on the total amount of *de minimis* aid granted to a single undertaking apply.

# Malta
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The agreement concluded between the Republic of Malta and the United States to improve international tax compliance and to implement the FATCA (the 'Agreement') entered into force on 26 June 2014. On 18 November 2014, the FATCA Regulations were accordingly issued implementing the said intergovernmental agreement (IGA). Guidelines on the implementation and interpretation of the FATCA Regulations and the said Agreement have been issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs and are updated periodically.
Furthermore, the Exchange of Information (United States of America) (FATCA) (Amendment) Order was enacted in 2015.
Guidelines on FATCA, providing guidance for its implementation and interpretation, have also been issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs and should be periodically updated.
## The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and EU Council Directive 2011/16/EU and 2014/107/EU
By virtue of LN 384 of 2015 entitled the ‘Cooperation with Other Jurisdiction on Tax Matters (Amendment) Regulations, 2015’, the EU Council Directive 2014/107/EU of 9 December 2014 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation (DAC2) and the CRS have been accordingly implemented into Maltese legislation, with effect from 1 January 2016.
Guidelines on the implementation and interpretation of the DAC2 and CRS have also been issued by the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs and updated periodically, with the last update issued on 28 February 2024. Although FATCA and CRS/DAC2 reporting is to be done primarily by the XML Schema reporting, the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs updated the alternative online reporting tool available to Maltese Financial Institutions that were classified as Reporting Malta Financial Institutions for DAC2 and CRS purposes. The reporting tool includes both the report to be submitted relating to the FATCA as well as DAC2/CRS. According to the latest Guidelines, the alternative online reporting tool is only made available after Reporting Malta Financial Institutions request authorisation from the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs, after they successfully manage to explain why they are unable to report by using the XML Schema reporting.
## Disclosure of Tax Arrangements (DAC6)
The provisions of the fifth update to Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation have been transposed and implemented into Maltese law (DAC6 or the Directive). The rules transpose the Directive provisions and impose mandatory disclosure by intermediaries (and taxpayers, in specified situations) of certain arrangements with an EU cross-border element where the arrangements bear certain 'hallmarks' set out in the Directive.
It should be noted that there are certain instances wherein an intermediary may waive the filing of certain information in certain situations. In such circumstances, the reporting obligation may shift to another intermediary or, in absence of such intermediary, to the relevant taxpayer. However, the intermediary is nevertheless required to notify such persons of their reporting obligations.
In the case that intermediaries have waived such reporting obligation, the said intermediaries are required to provide the Maltese Commissioner for Tax and Customs with an annual update specifying other intermediaries or taxpayers who will be carrying out the reporting.
## Reporting obligations for digital platforms (DAC7)
Legal Notice 8 of 2023, which was published on 20 January 2023, introduced rules that transposed the provisions of the sixth update to Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation into Maltese law (DAC7). DAC7 extends the EU tax transparency rules to digital ’platforms‘ and introduces an obligation on ’reporting platform operators‘ to collect, verify, and report specific information with respect to ’reportable sellers‘ that have undertaken ’relevant activities‘ through their platforms. DAC7 also introduces new automatic exchange of information between the EU tax authorities regarding the taxable events and income generated through these platforms. Furthermore, DAC7 includes a legal framework to enable joint audits. In joint audits, two or more countries join to form a single audit team to conduct a taxpayer examination.
Reporting platform operators are required to report to the local tax authorities specific information with respect to the operator itself and also with respect to the reportable sellers by 31 January of the year following the calendar year in which the seller is identified as a reportable seller. The tax administrations must then exchange the information between member states within one month, i.e. by the end of February. Penalties for non-compliance may apply.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties

## Foreign tax relief
There are no special credits for short-term residents. Income taxes paid abroad on income that becomes taxable in the hands of a Maltese resident may qualify for a credit if a double taxation treaty (DTT) has been concluded with the relevant country or under the unilateral relief provisions of Maltese law.
## Tax treaties

To be deductible, expenses of an employee must be incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income and must be necessarily incurred. Where the employer reimburses employees for expenses incurred on the employer's behalf, no tax liability should arise in the hands of the recipients unless a gain or profit accrues to them from the arrangement.
## Personal deductions
Alimony payments paid by a taxpayer to an estranged spouse are allowed as a deduction, while the receipt of the alimony is taxable in the hands of the recipient. The receipt of a payment for the maintenance of children is not taxable in the hands of the estranged spouse and not deductible in the hands of the person making the payment.
Certain deductions are allowable, which include:
## Personal allowances
No personal allowances by way of deductions or credits are granted.
## Business deductions

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Employment income
Gains or profits from employment income arising in Malta are usually fully taxable, including the value of ‘any benefit provided by reason of any employment or office’. Remuneration received for services rendered outside Malta by persons not domiciled or not ordinarily resident in Malta should not be liable to tax in Malta. Apportionment is used where necessary.
All rewards for services rendered, including fringe benefits and benefits in kind, are taxable, although some exemptions are provided. Taxable benefits include living allowances, housing allowances, tax reimbursements (grossed up), use of car, and paid vacation trips.
### Fringe benefits
Fringe benefits regulations provide the valuation criteria for fringe benefits and the instances where a fringe benefit is deemed not to arise.
Three main categories of fringe benefits are identified by the regulations.
#### Category 1 - Use of motor vehicles
The valuation of a fringe benefit arising on the use of a car is calculated on the basis of three elements: the car use value, the maintenance value, and the fuel value. The car use value is equivalent to 17% of the car value, or 10% if the car is more than six years old. In respect of both the maintenance and fuel value, the basis of valuation is 3% of the car value if the latter does not exceed EUR 28,000 and 5% of the car value in any other case. The fringe benefit is equal to the aggregate of these three elements multiplied by a percentage representing the private use of the car. The private use percentage varies depending on the respective car value and may go up to 60%.
The private use element (i.e. the taxable element) of a car cash allowance is 50% of the allowance if the allowance is EUR 2,340 or less, or the cash allowance less EUR 1,170 if the allowance exceeds EUR 2,340.
Amendments to the Fringe Benefit Rules have clarified that vans are included as non-taxable vehicles and that the use of vehicles by messengers and drivers do not constitute a fringe benefit.
#### Category 2 - Use of other assets, including accommodation
Use of immovable property/accommodation involves a chargeable fringe benefit of 5% of the higher of the market value and the original cost of the immovable property. No fringe benefit is deemed to arise in certain situations (e.g. use of an official residence by the holder of public office, temporary accommodation for security purposes). The cost of making the immovable property available for use by the employee (e.g. water, electricity, ground rent, redecoration, repairs and maintenance, professional fees) is also a fringe benefit.
The fringe benefit on the use of other assets (other than immovable property and motor vehicles) stands at 12% of the higher of the market value and the original cost of the asset. The original cost is reduced by 40% in the case of assets that are owned for more than six years. Use of computers, related equipment, and internet connection service is not considered a fringe benefit.
To determine the price of immovable property held under a title of emphyteusis, the price of acquisition should be considered to be the price or premium which may have been paid according to the deed of emphyteusis without the requisite to increase the amount by five times the annual ground rent payable.
Where property is held under a title of emphyteusis by the provider of the benefit or by a related person, the annual value of an immovable property used for private use should be taxed on the higher value between 5% of the market value, the total of 5% of the cost of the property and an amount equivalent to the relative annual ground rent.
Movable property should be taxed at 12% of the higher value between the market value and the cost of the property. The original cost is reduced by 40% in the case of assets that are owned for more than six years. Use of computers, related equipment, and internet connection service is not considered a fringe benefit.
#### Category 3 - Other benefits
The value of other fringe benefits is the actual cost to the employer of providing the fringe benefit or the market value thereof. This category of fringe benefits includes, amongst other items, beneficial loan arrangements, reimbursement of private expenses, discounted goods and services, free or subsidised meals, and gifts. Valuation criteria differ according to the type of benefit, with the possibility of a partial or a full exemption in certain cases.
Certain items are not deemed to constitute a benefit, for instance, exemptions on cost of travel (including relocation costs and costs of the journey between shifts or periods of work) and exemptions for health-related costs (including costs of medical exams, preventive medical care for work-related risks, and work-related counselling).
The benchmark interest rate with reference to beneficial loan arrangements is 6.5% *per annum*.
In the case of share option schemes, a share option becomes taxable when the option is exercised. In this respect, the taxable value of the said share option would be equivalent to the full excess of the price that the shares would realise on the open market, on the date when the benefit is provided, above the price actually paid for those same shares. The taxable value should be taxed separately from the other chargeable income and subject to a flat rate of 15%.
Telephony services, computer equipment, recreational and child-minding facilities, health insurance (subject to some restrictions), certain awards, and certain training courses, among other items, provided to employees are not considered to be fringe benefits.
## Capital gains and investment income
Tax on capital gains is imposed on any gain realised on the transfer of immovable property (real estate), shares and other securities (excluding investments that yield a fixed rate of return), business, goodwill, business permits, copyrights, patents, trade names, trademarks, and any other intellectual property (IP), interests in a partnership, and a beneficial interest in a trust. Gains from the transfer of other assets should fall outside the scope of such tax.
Furthermore, certain transfers are subject to an exemption from income tax on capital gains. The exemption from income tax on capital gains upon certain transfers of shares listed on the Malta Stock Exchange was extended to certain transfers of shares listed on foreign stock exchanges that are recognised by the Commissioner for Tax and Customs (subject to certain conditions).
The rate of tax is the marginal rate of tax applicable to the particular taxpayer. In the case of transfers of Maltese immovable property (or any rights thereon) made on or after 1 January 2015, the withholding tax (WHT) on such transfers should in general be 8% or 10% of the transfer value (the latter rate applying in the case where the property was acquired before 1 January 2004). Certain other rates of WHT may apply in specific circumstances.
Transfers *inter vivos* of immovable property situated in Malta or any real rights thereon over such property shall be made at the rate of 8% or 10% of the transfer value.
No tax is chargeable on a transfer of certain property by a company to its shareholder or to an individual related to its shareholder in the course of winding up or in the course of a distribution of assets pursuant to a scheme of distribution. This applies where the said shareholder is an individual or one’s spouse who owns, directly or indirectly, not less than 95% of the share capital and voting rights of the said company transferring the property, provided a number of conditions are satisfied.
Subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, transfer of a property to a tenant who had previously leased the same property for a number of years in terms of a scheme administered by the Housing Authority under a scheme administered by the Housing Authority is exempt from final tax on the first EUR 200,000 of the transfer value. In cases where the exemption will not apply, a reduced rate of tax may be applicable.
Capital gains arising outside Malta and derived by a person who is either not domiciled or not ordinarily resident in Malta or who is a returned migrant who qualifies for a reduced rate of income tax are not subject to tax, even if remitted to Malta.
Subject to the applicable statutory requirements, non-residents are exempt from tax on any interest, discount, premium or royalties, and capital gains from specified sources (e.g. disposal of units in collective investment schemes and of shares or securities in companies, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions).
No tax is levied on investments that yield a fixed rate of return. A tax exemption also applies on the transfer of shares in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange (as of year of assessment 2018, this exemption was widened in scope) other than shares held in certain collective investment schemes.
### Transfers of immovable property in Urban Conservation Areas
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, transfers of immovable property that are made by 31 December 2025 are exempt from income tax on the first EUR 750,000 of the transfer value if:
## Dividend income
### Dividends from Maltese companies
Malta operates a full imputation system of taxation of dividends. Through this system, the tax paid at company level is regarded as a prepayment for the tax due by the shareholder upon the eventual distribution of profits. Individual shareholders will, subject to certain conditions, not be subject to further income tax on the receipt of a dividend of taxed profits (or exempt profits which are exempt up to the level of the ultimate shareholder) from a Maltese company. Subject to certain thresholds of income, individual shareholders should be entitled to deduct the tax credit attaching to the dividend against their total income tax liability.
### Dividends from foreign companies
Maltese resident and domiciled individuals are taxed on a worldwide basis of taxation, and therefore dividends from foreign corporations should be subject to income tax in Malta. Maltese resident but not domiciled individuals are subject to income tax in Malta on dividends from foreign corporations only if such dividends are remitted to/ received in Malta.
Dividends are taxed at the standard progressive rates of tax applicable to individuals. Foreign withholding tax suffered should be granted as a credit against the Malta tax liability on the foreign dividend income, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The credit must not exceed the tax liability in Malta on that income.
## Rental income
Any person who owns immovable property that has been restored in accordance with any scheme issued for this purpose by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority and rents out such property may opt to be subject to tax at a final WHT rate of 10% on the gross rental income received in respect of rent for residential purposes and a final WHT of 15% for commercial purposes. Rent also includes ground rent for both urban and rural tenements.
Persons in receipt of rent/ground rent of residential property and of commercial tenements and clubs (in all cases, not necessarily restored property), provided that the commercial tenements and clubs are not being rented to or from a related body of persons (as defined), have the option to apply a final 15% tax on the gross rental income.
Any person who derived rental income from a private residential lease with a duration of a least two years and registers such lease as a long private residential lease with the relevant authority, if they opt to be taxed on such gross rental income at 15%, may also be entitled to a tax rebate.
Otherwise, the rental income is subject to normal rates of tax, but special tax deduction rules apply. Indeed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, where the general progressive tax rates apply, interest payable on loans to acquire/improve the property, licence fees, and rents payable may be deducted if incurred in the production of passive rental income.
## Assignments of rights acquired under a promise of sale agreement
Income derived from the assignment of rights acquired under a promise of sale agreement relating to the transfer of an immovable property situated in Malta that is made after 31 December 2020 is subject to a flat tax rate of 15% on the full amount.

## Certain tax exemptions for investment services expatriates and insurance expatriates
Certain tax exemptions are provided to investment services expatriates and insurance expatriates as defined under the Maltese Income Tax Act and subject to the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions (these cannot be taken together with the Highly Qualified Persons Rules). An investment services expatriate and an insurance expatriate may not be subject to Maltese tax in respect of the following income (otherwise liable to tax) relating to expenditures incurred for the benefit of the expatriate or one’s immediate family by the investment service/insurance company for the first ten years of assessment from when the said expatriate becomes liable to Maltese tax. The respective expenses include:
Furthermore, interest, royalties, and capital gains on disposal of units in collective investment schemes and company shares/securities (subject to certain conditions) that are received by such expatriates are exempt from Maltese tax.
An investment services expatriate may also be exempt from payment of Maltese social security contributions, subject to certain conditions.
## Voluntary Occupational Pension Scheme (VOPS) Rules
The VOPS Rules were recently amended to further enhance the fiscal measures already in place to incentivise the occupational pension system in Malta. The VOPS Rules apply to certain types of employers as defined, including self-occupied persons and associations representing employers and self-occupied persons. The fiscal measures introduced by the Rules can be summarised as comprising:
## Personal Retirement Scheme (PRS) Rules
The PRS Rules are a set of tax measures intended to incentivise contributions to PRSs.
An annual tax credit is available to individuals who make contributions to a PRS of 25% of the aggregate amount of the qualifying contributions made during a year, up to a maximum of EUR 750. Similar to the VOPS, for a scheme to qualify under the PRS Rules, it needs to allow individuals to start withdrawing benefits as from the age of 61 years but not later than the age of 70 years.
## Tax credit to parents of children with a disability
Parents of children with a disability will be entitled to an annual tax credit of EUR 750 *per annum* for each child (increased from EUR 500) to assist with any private therapy that may be required.
## Tax credit on higher educational qualifications
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, an individual under the age of 40 who attains a PhD or a Master’s degree or an equivalent qualification thereto (MQF Level 7 or 8) may be eligible for a tax credit equivalent to the tax chargeable on the income for whole-time employment . If the individual pursues the relevant course of studies on a part-time basis, the tax credit is reduced by 50%.
The Deduction and Tax Credits (Relevant Qualifications for Industry) Rules provide for a tax credit of up to 70% of the study costs paid for a certification, degree, or post-graduate degree, as approved by the Ministry of Education. The tax credit may only be claimed once the relevant qualification is obtained and the Department of Education issues a tax credit certificate. The said tax credit may be claimed against the tax liability on chargeable income by either the parents or the student. If the tax credit is not claimed in full, then the balance may be carried forward to the next years. This tax credit was extended to courses of studies commencing up to 31 December 2025.
By virtue of the Get Qualified Scheme, individuals following a course of studies that commences not later than 31 December 2025 and leads to a certification, diploma, degree, or post-graduate degree course may be entitled to benefit from a tax credit to recover part of the costs incurred. The costs relate to fees paid by the individual to the university, institution, or other entity recognised by the Ministry for Education and Employment for the training and educational services leading to the approved qualification or fees for sitting for examinations required to achieve the approved qualification.
