# United Arab Emirates
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Social security contributions
There is a social security regime in the UAE that applies to qualifying UAE and other GCC national employees only. Non-GCC nationals are not subject to social security in the UAE.
For UAE national employees, social security contributions are calculated at a rate of 20% of the employee's gross remuneration as stated in the local employment contract. Social security obligations also apply to employees of companies and branches registered in a Free Zone. Out of the 20%, 5% is payable by the employee, 12.5% is payable by the employer, and an additional 2.5% contribution is made by the government. A higher rate of 26% is applied in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, where the contribution of the employer is increased to 15%, the government’s contribution is increased to 6%, and the employee’s contribution remains 5%.
The employer is responsible for withholding and remitting employee social security contributions.
In the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the DIFC Employee Workplace Savings Scheme (DEWS) has been introduced, replacing the End of Service Gratuity Benefit (EOSG) , with the aim of protecting long-term employee savings. The new scheme was rolled out on 1 February 2020, and employers now are required to make monthly contributions to DEWS or an alternative regulated Qualifying Scheme, as opposed to paying a lump sum ‘gratuity payment’ to an employee at the end of their employment.  Employers are required to contribute monthly contributions of 5.83% or 8.33% of the employee’s basic salary (the actual percentage is contingent upon the employee’s length of service) into the scheme.
### Unemployment insurance scheme
The scheme divides subscribers into two categories: (i) those who earn AED 16,000 or less as basic salary per month and (ii) those who earn more than AED 16,000 as their monthly basic salary. Those who fall under the former category are required to pay a monthly subscription fee of AED 5, while those who fall under the latter category must pay a monthly subscription fee of AED 10. The obligation for the deduction of the monthly subscription fee falls on the employee.
While the scheme is mandatory for Emirati and foreign workers in the private and public sectors, it does not apply to the following groups:
## Capital gains taxes
There is currently no personal income tax in the UAE. As such, capital gains tax is not imposed on UAE national or resident individuals.
## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT) was implemented in the UAE on 1 January 2018.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no wealth taxes imposed on individuals in the UAE.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are currently no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes imposed on individuals in the UAE.
## Municipal or property tax
Most Emirates impose a municipality tax on properties, mostly by reference to the annual rental value. It is generally the tenants' obligation to pay the tax. In some cases, separate fees are payable by both tenants and property owners. For example, in the Emirate of Dubai, the municipality tax on property is currently imposed at 5% on annual rental value for commercial properties, also known as 'market fees' (paid by property owners), and 5% for residential properties, also known as 'housing fees' (paid by tenants and owners if no tenant).
A registration fee may be levied on transfer of ownership of land or real property. For example, a land registration fee is levied in the Emirate of Dubai at a rate of 4% of the fair market value of the property on any third-party sale (a cost generally borne by a buyer), payable to the Dubai Land Department. In Dubai, the registration fee may also apply on the direct or indirect transfer of shares in an entity that owns real property.
These levies are imposed and administered differently at varying rates by each Emirate.
## Luxury taxes
There are currently no luxury taxes levied in the UAE.
## Customs duties
All goods imported into the UAE are subject to UAE Customs entry requirements and are dutiable or duty-free in accordance with their classification under the applicable Customs Tariff of the UAE. The tariff classification also identifies eligibility for special import requirements.
Generally, a customs duty rate of 5% is imposed on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of imports. Other rates may apply to certain goods, such as alcohol and tobacco, and certain exemptions and reliefs may also be available. Further, the UAE imposes anti-dumping duties on imports of certain goods, such as car batteries, ceramic and porcelain tiles, and hydraulic cement. The anti-dumping duty rates vary depending on the HS codes of the goods and country of export and/or origin. In some cases, the anti-dumping duty is 67.5% of the CIF value of the goods.
The UAE is part of the GCC Customs Union, which removes customs and trade barriers among the GCC member states. Additionally, the UAE grants duty-free access to imports originating in member countries of a number of Free Trade Agreements, such as Singapore, the European Free Trade Association countries (i.e. Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), Israel, India, Turkey, Indonesia, etc.
## Hotel tax and tourism levies
Most Emirates impose hotel levies, which apply on the value of hotel room rental, services, and entertainment. These levies are imposed and administered differently by each Emirate.
In addition to tourism fees, the Emirate of Dubai also requires hotels to levy a 7% municipality fee on each hotel sale. Likewise, in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, hotels are required to levy a 4% municipality fee. A hotel sale is revenue generated by a hotel for services provided to their guests or visitors, which includes rent for the hotel room, food, beverages, and other services.
Hotels in all Emirates levy an additional service charge equivalent to 10% of the hotel sale revenue.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Tax base for Emirate level taxes
For Emirate level income taxes, the tax base is defined in the respective Emirate level decrees, laws, fiscal agreements or fiscal letters. Such tax base may significantly differ from the tax base described below for the purposes of the UAE Federal CT.
## Tax base for UAE Federal CT
Under the UAE CT Law, the accounting net profit (or loss) as stated in the standalone financial statements of a business is taken as the starting point for determining its taxable income. The law prescribes a number of key adjustments to the accounting net profit (or loss) in order to compute the taxable income.
The following table sets out the aspects to consider when determining the nature of a taxable person (i.e. resident vs. non-resident) as well as the applicable tax base:
| Resident person | Tax base |
| --- | --- |
| An entity that is incorporated in the UAE (including a Free Zone entity) | Worldwide income |
| A foreign entity that is effectively managed and controlled in the UAE | Worldwide income |
| A natural person who conducts a business or business activity in the UAE | Worldwide income only where it relates to business activity within the UAE |
| Any other person (may be determined by a Cabinet Decision) | Worldwide income |
| Non-resident person | Tax base |
| Has a PE in the UAE | Taxable income attributable to the PE |
| Derives UAE-sourced income | The UAE-sourced income not attributable to the PE |
| Has nexus in the UAE | Taxable income attributable to the nexus |
## Capital gains
There are no separate capital gains provisions under the UAE CT Law. Any gains / (loss) on disposal of capital assets would form part of the taxable income.
## Unrealised gains or losses
Based on the CT Law, a taxable person that prepares financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting can opt for the following:
## Exempt income
To avoid instances of double taxation, and recognising the UAE’s position as an international business hub and leading holding company location, the UAE CT regime automatically exempts dividends and other profit distributions received by a UAE taxable person (UAE tax resident, or UAE PE of a non-resident) from a UAE tax resident person (domestic dividends). For other types of investment income, see the Participation Exemption relief below.
### Participation Exemption
The below rules apply to capital gains and other similar income from UAE tax resident persons, as well as to dividends and other profit distributions and capital gains from foreign juridical persons.
Dividends, other profit distributions, and capital gains and other similar income are exempt if the ownership interest (referred to as a ‘participating interest’) in a  juridical person (referred to as ‘participation’) meets the following tests:
The ‘subject to tax’ test would also be satisfied if:
### Foreign Permanent Establishment Exemption
A resident person could create a PE in another jurisdiction based on the domestic tax laws of this jurisdiction, subject to any tax treaty. Generally, the income attributed to such a foreign PE will be taxed in that jurisdiction. In such a scenario, the UAE CT Law provides an option to the resident person to elect for an exemption of this income in the UAE. The exemption will be available if the foreign PE is subject to CT or similar taxes at a rate not less than 9% in the foreign jurisdiction. If the resident person opts for this exemption, it will not be eligible to take into account in the UAE the losses, income, expenditure, and foreign tax credits in relation to the foreign PE.
### International transportation exemption
Income earned by a non-resident from operating aircraft or ships in international transportation will not be subject to CT in the UAE if the income earned by a UAE resident person that carries on these activities is exempt from CT in the jurisdiction of the non-resident.
## Partners in an unincorporated partnership
As a general rule, an unincorporated partnership should not be treated as a taxable person, i.e. the partnership is looked through and each partner should be treated as an individual taxable person on its distributive share.  Each partner would be responsible for the full UAE CT compliance as if each carrying on independent business subject to UAE CT. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenditure of the partnership should be allocated to each partner in accordance with their distributive share.
The Ministerial Decision No. 261 of 2024 has clarified that a UAE unincorporated partnership shall not be considered a taxable person in its own right unless it is a juridical person.
Partners in an unincorporated partnership can make an irrevocable (save exceptional circumstances) application to the FTA for the unincorporated partnership to be treated as a taxable person, i.e. to be recognised as its own entity subject to UAE CT. Where this application is made, partners remain jointly and severally liable for the partnership’s CT liability. One partner will be appointed as the responsible partner for any UAE CT obligations and proceedings for the partnership.
## Foreign partnerships
Foreign partnerships will be treated as unincorporated partnerships where:
## Family foundations
The UAE CT Law identifies family foundations, trusts, and similar entities as independent juridical persons that are used to protect and manage the assets of an individual or a family with a separate legal personality.
A UAE family foundation can apply to be treated as a tax transparent unincorporated partnership for UAE CT purposes under certain conditions. Thus, a UAE based family foundation structure, with an elected tax transparent status, generally prevents the income of the foundation or trust from attracting UAE CT and is a useful vehicle for families to ensure a tax efficient holding structure, proper governance, as well as succession planning.
The Ministerial Decision #261 of 2024 extends the option for a tax transparent status to any underlying legal entity wholly owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by a family foundation. Whereas a family foundation previously had to hold the assets directly in order for any income they generate to benefit from the structure’s tax transparent status, this amendment allows family foundations to hold assets via a legal entity such as a company without compromising the overall tax efficiency of the structure.

# United Arab Emirates
## Overview
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
The United Arab Emirates (UAE), located in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula, is bordered by the Arabian Gulf to the north, Oman to the east, and Saudi Arabia to the south and west.
It is a constitutional federation of seven Emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al-Quwain, Ras Al-Khaimah, and Fujairah. The federation was formally established on 2 December 1971, and the capital is Abu Dhabi. Arabic is the official language of the UAE, with English widely spoken and used in business, and the currency is the UAE Dirham (AED), pegged to the Unites States Dollar.
The UAE has a well-established infrastructure, stable political system, and one of the most liberal trade regimes in the Gulf region. It continues to be increasingly important, relevant, and attractive to businesses from around the world as a place to do business and as a hub for the region and beyond. The UAE is also one of the best examples in the region of an economy that has successfully moved away from reliance on the energy sector. A significant proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP) is derived from non-oil revenues.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
With the broader objective of having a simplified yet robust UAE CT regime to reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers, a WHT (currently set at 0%) will apply to certain types of UAE-sourced income derived by non-residents insofar as it is not attributable to a PE of the non-resident. The applicable WHT rate, as well as the categories of income to which WHT applies, may be set out in a decision issued by the Cabinet.
Given the current 0% WHT rate, it is not expected that there will be any registration or filing obligation.
## WHT credit
A credit is available for any UAE WHT suffered by a new UAE taxable person to reduce its UAE CT payable in the same tax period. This WHT credit is limited to the lower of the amount of WHT deducted and the UAE CT due.
Any excess of such WHT credit will be refunded to the taxable person.
## Tax treaty network
UAE national or resident individuals and UAE resident companies have access to an extensive and growing double tax treaty (DTT) network. The DTTs could allow for relief from taxation in DTT partner countries. The DTTs currently in force are listed below based on publicly available information which may not be up to date. A number of other DTTs are at various stages of negotiation and ratification.

Notes
1. This DTT includes a ‘favoured nation’ clause. If this jurisdiction ever concludes a more favourable treaty WHT rate with a country other than the UAE, then the more favourable treaty WHT rate will automatically apply to the UAE treaty as well. Note that the above-mentioned rates do not reflect the more favourable DTT rates but only the rates presented in the DTT between the UAE and the relevant jurisdiction. The more favourable rates will need to be confirmed separately.
2. The UAE-Malaysia DTT provides for a reduced rate of 10% where dividend payments are made from a UAE entity to a Malaysian entity. The DTT, however, provides for a lower rate of 0% where payments are made from a Malaysian entity to a UAE entity.
3. Government institutions only. There is a new UAE-Russia DTT signed in February 2025.

# United Arab Emirates
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Absence of taxation
There is currently no personal income tax in the UAE. As such, there are no individual tax registration or reporting obligations.
Under the UAE CT Law, natural persons who conduct a business or business activity in the UAE will be subject to UAE CT at 9% where the total turnover derived from such business or business activity exceeds 1 million AED. For this purpose, wages, personal investment income, and real estate investment income will not be considered for determining such turnover.
## Local income taxes
There is no federal or Emirate-level personal income tax in the UAE.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The general VAT rate is 5% and applies to most goods and services, with some goods and services subject to a 0% rate or an exemption from VAT (subject to specific conditions being met).
The 0% VAT rate applies to goods and services exported outside the VAT-implementing Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states, international transportation, the supply of crude oil/natural gas, the first supply of residential real estate, and some specific areas, such as health care and education.
Further, according to Cabinet Decision No. 46 of 2020, a person shall be considered as being ‘outside the state’, and thus fall under zero-rating export of services, if they only have a short-term presence in the state of less than a month and the presence is not effectively connected with the supply.
A VAT exemption applies to certain financial services, as well as to the subsequent supply of residential real estate. Further, transactions in bare land and domestic passenger transport are also exempt from VAT.
Certain transactions in goods between companies established in UAE Designated (Free) Zones (DZs) may not be subject to VAT. The supply of services within DZs is, however, subject to VAT in accordance with the general application of the UAE VAT legislation.
For UAE resident businesses, the mandatory VAT registration threshold is AED 375,000 and the voluntary registration threshold is AED 187,500. No registration threshold applies to non-resident businesses making supplies on which the UAE VAT is required to be charged.
VAT grouping is allowed, provided certain conditions are met. Note that VAT grouping rules are different from UAE CT grouping rules, and such groups may not always align.
There are specific documentary and record-keeping requirements, such as the requirement to issue tax invoices and submit VAT returns (on a quarterly or monthly basis depending on the allocation by the FTA).
Excess input VAT can, in principle, be claimed back from the FTA, subject to a specific procedure. Alternatively, VAT credits may be carried forward and deducted from future output VAT.
Businesses that do not comply with their VAT obligations can be subject to fines and penalties. There are both fixed and tax-geared penalties.
## Customs duties
All goods imported into the UAE are subject to UAE Customs entry requirements and are dutiable or duty-free in accordance with their classification under the applicable customs tariff of the UAE. The tariff classification also identifies eligibility for special import requirements.
Generally, a customs duty rate of 5% is imposed on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of imports. Other rates may apply to certain goods, such as alcohol and tobacco, and certain exemptions and reliefs may also be available. Further, the UAE imposes anti-dumping duties on imports of certain goods, such as car batteries, ceramic and porcelain tiles, and hydraulic cement. The anti-dumping duty rates vary depending on the HS codes of the goods and country of export and/or origin. In some cases, the anti-dumping duty is 67.5% of the CIF value of the goods.
The UAE is part of the GCC Customs Union, which removes customs and trade barriers among the GCC member states. Additionally, the UAE grants duty-free access to imports originating in member countries of a number of Free Trade Agreements, such as Singapore, the European Free Trade Association countries (i.e. Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), Israel, India, Turkey, Indonesia, etc.
## Excise taxes
The UAE excise tax rates are:
## Municipal or property tax
Most Emirates impose a municipality tax on properties, mostly by reference to the annual rental value. It is generally the tenants' obligation to pay the tax. In some cases, separate fees are payable by both tenants and property owners. For example, in the Emirate of Dubai, the municipality tax on property is currently imposed at 2.5% on annual rental value for commercial properties (paid by property owners) and 5% for residential properties (paid by tenants or by owners based on a market value of rental if not rented).
A registration fee may be levied on transfer of ownership of land or real property. For example, a land registration fee is levied in the Emirate of Dubai at a rate of 4% of the fair market value of the property, payable to the Dubai Land Department. In Dubai, the registration fee may also apply on the direct or indirect transfer of shares in an entity that owns real property.
These levies are imposed and administered differently by each Emirate.
## Stamp taxes
Currently, there are no separate stamp taxes in the UAE.
## Payroll taxes
There is no personal income tax in the UAE.
## Social security contributions
There is a social security regime in the UAE that applies to qualifying UAE and other GCC national employees only. Non-GCC nationals are not subject to social security in the UAE.
For UAE national employees (with the exception of those employed in Abu Dhabi), social security contributions are calculated at a rate of 20% of the employee's gross remuneration as stated in the local employment contract. Social security obligations also apply to employees of companies and branches registered in a Free Zone. Out of the 20%, 5% is payable by the employee, 12.5% is payable by the employer, and an additional 2.5% contribution is made by the government. A higher rate of 26% is applied in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, where the contribution of the employer is increased to 15%, the government’s contribution is increased to 6%, and the employee’s contribution remains 5%. The contributions are subject to a statutory minimum and maximum salary amount (against which the amount of the pension contributions is calculated) of AED 1,000 and AED 50,000, respectively.
The employer is responsible for withholding and remitting employee social security contributions together with the employer’s share.
In the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the DIFC Employee Workplace Savings Scheme (DEWS) has been introduced, replacing the End of Service Gratuity Benefit (EOSG), with the aim of protecting long-term employee savings. The new scheme was rolled out on 1 February 2020, and employers now are required to make monthly contributions to DEWS or an alternative regulated Qualifying Scheme, as opposed to paying a lump sum ‘gratuity payment’ to an employee at the end of their employment. Employers are required to contribute monthly contributions of 5.83% or 8.33% of the employee’s basic salary (the actual percentage is contingent upon the employee’s length of service) into the scheme.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
The FTA is responsible for the administration, collection, and enforcement of UAE CT, while the MoF will remain the ‘competent authority’ in terms of international tax agreements and the exchange of information for tax purposes.
## Taxable period
A taxable person’s tax period is the financial year (the Gregorian calendar year or the 12-month period for which financial statements are prepared) or part thereof for which a UAE CT return is required to be filed.
A taxable person can make an application to the FTA to change the start and end date of its tax period, or use a different tax period, subject to the following conditions:
It is important to note that a taxable UAE resident person may only change the relevant tax period by means of either extending the current tax period to be a maximum of 18 months or shortening the following tax period to be a minimum of 6 months and a maximum 12 months.
## CT registration, returns, and payments
Every taxable person is required to electronically register for UAE CT with the FTA within a prescribed timeline and obtain a Tax Registration Number (CT TRN), which is different from VAT TRN.
In order to keep the administrative burden on taxpayers to a minimum, the CT Law requires a taxable person to file only one tax return for each tax period.
The filing is done electronically no later than 9 months from the end of the relevant tax period. Any UAE CT payable will also need to be settled within this timeline.
### Tax assessment
A taxable person may be subject to a UAE CT assessment in accordance with the Tax Procedures Law. In case a non-compliance to the CT Law is identified during the assessment, penalties and fines determined per the Tax Procedures Law could be imposed.
### Financial statements
Taxable persons shall prepare financial statements by applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Such financial statements shall be audited (by a UAE licensed auditor) if the taxable person earns revenue exceeding the threshold of AED 50 million during a relevant tax period or if the taxable person is regarded as a QFZP.
In case the revenue does not exceed AED 3 million or through an application in exceptional circumstances to the FTA, the financial statements may be prepared on a cash basis (as opposed to accrual).
### Record keeping
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Tax Procedures Law, a taxable person shall maintain, for UAE CT Law purposes, all records and documents for a period of 7 years following the end of the tax period to which they relate.
### Clarifications and rulings
A person can make an application to the FTA for a Private Clarification regarding any part of the UAE CT Law or for concluding an APA for a transaction or arrangement.
## General anti-abuse rule (GAAR)
In line with international best practice, the UAE CT Law includes a GAAR, which applies to transactions giving rise to a tax advantage where no valid commercial reason exists and where the tax advantage was the main or one of the main purposes of the transaction.
Where the GAAR applies, the FTA can make a determination that one or more specified CT advantages are to be counteracted or adjusted. If such a determination is made, the FTA must issue an assessment giving effect to the determination and can make compensating adjustments to the UAE CT liability of any other person affected by the determination.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Social security contributions
There is a social security regime in the UAE that applies to qualifying UAE and other GCC national employees only. Non-GCC nationals are not subject to social security in the UAE.
For UAE national employees, social security contributions are calculated at a rate of 20% of the employee's gross remuneration as stated in the local employment contract. Social security obligations also apply to employees of companies and branches registered in a Free Zone. Out of the 20%, 5% is payable by the employee, 12.5% is payable by the employer, and an additional 2.5% contribution is made by the government. A higher rate of 26% is applied in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, where the contribution of the employer is increased to 15%, the government’s contribution is increased to 6%, and the employee’s contribution remains 5%.
The employer is responsible for withholding and remitting employee social security contributions.
In the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the DIFC Employee Workplace Savings Scheme (DEWS) has been introduced, replacing the End of Service Gratuity Benefit (EOSG) , with the aim of protecting long-term employee savings. The new scheme was rolled out on 1 February 2020, and employers now are required to make monthly contributions to DEWS or an alternative regulated Qualifying Scheme, as opposed to paying a lump sum ‘gratuity payment’ to an employee at the end of their employment.  Employers are required to contribute monthly contributions of 5.83% or 8.33% of the employee’s basic salary (the actual percentage is contingent upon the employee’s length of service) into the scheme.
### Unemployment insurance scheme
The scheme divides subscribers into two categories: (i) those who earn AED 16,000 or less as basic salary per month and (ii) those who earn more than AED 16,000 as their monthly basic salary. Those who fall under the former category are required to pay a monthly subscription fee of AED 5, while those who fall under the latter category must pay a monthly subscription fee of AED 10. The obligation for the deduction of the monthly subscription fee falls on the employee.
While the scheme is mandatory for Emirati and foreign workers in the private and public sectors, it does not apply to the following groups:
## Capital gains taxes
There is currently no personal income tax in the UAE. As such, capital gains tax is not imposed on UAE national or resident individuals.
## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT) was implemented in the UAE on 1 January 2018.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no wealth taxes imposed on individuals in the UAE.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are currently no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes imposed on individuals in the UAE.
## Municipal or property tax
Most Emirates impose a municipality tax on properties, mostly by reference to the annual rental value. It is generally the tenants' obligation to pay the tax. In some cases, separate fees are payable by both tenants and property owners. For example, in the Emirate of Dubai, the municipality tax on property is currently imposed at 5% on annual rental value for commercial properties, also known as 'market fees' (paid by property owners), and 5% for residential properties, also known as 'housing fees' (paid by tenants and owners if no tenant).
A registration fee may be levied on transfer of ownership of land or real property. For example, a land registration fee is levied in the Emirate of Dubai at a rate of 4% of the fair market value of the property on any third-party sale (a cost generally borne by a buyer), payable to the Dubai Land Department. In Dubai, the registration fee may also apply on the direct or indirect transfer of shares in an entity that owns real property.
These levies are imposed and administered differently at varying rates by each Emirate.
## Luxury taxes
There are currently no luxury taxes levied in the UAE.
## Customs duties
All goods imported into the UAE are subject to UAE Customs entry requirements and are dutiable or duty-free in accordance with their classification under the applicable Customs Tariff of the UAE. The tariff classification also identifies eligibility for special import requirements.
Generally, a customs duty rate of 5% is imposed on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of imports. Other rates may apply to certain goods, such as alcohol and tobacco, and certain exemptions and reliefs may also be available. Further, the UAE imposes anti-dumping duties on imports of certain goods, such as car batteries, ceramic and porcelain tiles, and hydraulic cement. The anti-dumping duty rates vary depending on the HS codes of the goods and country of export and/or origin. In some cases, the anti-dumping duty is 67.5% of the CIF value of the goods.
The UAE is part of the GCC Customs Union, which removes customs and trade barriers among the GCC member states. Additionally, the UAE grants duty-free access to imports originating in member countries of a number of Free Trade Agreements, such as Singapore, the European Free Trade Association countries (i.e. Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), Israel, India, Turkey, Indonesia, etc.
## Hotel tax and tourism levies
Most Emirates impose hotel levies, which apply on the value of hotel room rental, services, and entertainment. These levies are imposed and administered differently by each Emirate.
In addition to tourism fees, the Emirate of Dubai also requires hotels to levy a 7% municipality fee on each hotel sale. Likewise, in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, hotels are required to levy a 4% municipality fee. A hotel sale is revenue generated by a hotel for services provided to their guests or visitors, which includes rent for the hotel room, food, beverages, and other services.
Hotels in all Emirates levy an additional service charge equivalent to 10% of the hotel sale revenue.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Under the Emirate-level tax decrees, income tax is payable under a progressive rate system, with rates up to 55%. However, in practice, these tax decrees have not been applied. Instead, branches of foreign banks are subject to income tax at a flat rate of 20% under separate Emirate-level bank decrees. Companies engaged in UAE oil and gas and petrochemical activities are subject to income tax at varying rates under their individual UAE concession agreements or fiscal letters.
The Federal UAE CT Law, which is effective for each taxable person’s new financial year beginning on or after 1 June 2023, is applicable across all Emirates and applies to all business and commercial activities, except to the following exempt persons (subject to conditions):
UAE CT is applicable at the following rates:
| Taxable income | UAE CT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| * Taxable income not exceeding 375,000 UAE dirham (AED). * Qualifying income of a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP).\* | 0 |
| * Taxable income exceeding AED 375,000. * Non-qualifying income of a QFZP. | 9 |
\* *Please refer to Free Zones in the [Tax credits and incentives](united-arab-emirates/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section**.*

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
The UAE Federal Corporate Tax (CT) was introduced in December 2022 and applies to taxpayers’ financial years starting on or after 1 June 2023.
UAE CT is applicable across all Emirates and applies to all business and commercial activities, subject to certain exceptions. Transfer pricing rules and documentation requirements are also introduced as part of the UAE CT regime. The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) is responsible for the administration, collection, and enforcement of CT.
On 9 December 2024, the UAE Ministry of Finance announced updates in relation to UAE CT Law. These include:
The Pillar Two rules require large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits in every country where they operate. The UAE DMTT will apply to multinational enterprises operating in the UAE with consolidated global revenues of EUR750 million or more in at least two out of the four financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which the DMTT applies. The UAE’s implementation of the DMTT will closely align with the OECD’s GloBE Model Rules.
Further, Cabinet Decision No. 142 of 31 December 2024 introduced the detailed legislation on the UAE DMTT including cases, provisions, conditions, rules, controls, and procedures. It is broadly aligned with the OECD’s Inclusive Framework (IF).
The UAE continues to enhance its business-friendly environment, reflecting its commitment to national strategic objectives such as strengthening economic competitiveness and improving ease of doing business. To promote sustainable growth, innovation, and investment, the Ministry of Finance is currently considering the introduction of the following Corporate Tax Incentives under UAE CT Law.
Another incentive being considered is a refundable tax credit for high-value employment activities. This aims to encourage businesses to engage in activities that deliver significant economic benefits, stimulate innovation, and enhance the UAE’s global competitiveness. This incentive is proposed to take effect from 1 January 2025 and will be granted as a percentage of eligible salary costs for employees engaged in high-value employment activities. This includes C-suite executives and other senior personnel performing core business functions that add substantial value to the UAE economy.
The final form and implementation of the above mentioned proposed incentives are subject to legislative approvals.
In February 2025, the Emirate of Sharjah announced its law with 20% Emirate level corporate tax on companies engaged in extractive and non-extractive natural resource activities. The Law is not yet available in the public domain.
Under the law, companies subject to its provisions, if they are liable under applicable federal legislation for any type of direct tax (e.g. UAE Federal Corporate Tax), are granted a deduction from the Sharjah tax due under this law equal to any direct federal tax that is proven to have been paid to the state by the company.
It is yet to be seen how Free Zone entities, taxed under the Federal Corporate Tax Law at 0% as Qualifying Free Zone Persons, will be taxed under this Sharjah tax law.
A UAE based family foundation structure, with an elected tax transparent status, generally prevents the income of the foundation or trust from attracting UAE CT and is a useful vehicle for families to ensure a tax efficient holding structure, proper governance, as well as succession planning.
The Ministerial Decision #261 of 2024 extends the option for a tax transparent status to any underlying legal entity wholly owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by a family foundation. Whereas a family foundation previously had to hold the assets directly in order for any income they generate to benefit from the structure’s tax transparent status, this amendment allows family foundations to hold assets via a legal entity such as a company without compromising the overall tax efficiency of the structure.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## UAE tax residency
For the purposes of UAE CT Law, a taxable person shall be either a resident person or a non-resident person.
Juridical persons that are incorporated or otherwise formed or recognised under the laws of the UAE (both in mainland and Free Zones) are considered UAE resident persons.
Foreign juridical persons may also be treated as resident persons for UAE CT purposes where they are effectively managed and controlled (POEM) in the UAE.
Natural persons who conduct business or business activity in the UAE are also viewed as taxable resident persons for UAE CT purposes.
A non-resident person is a person who is not considered a resident person as above and that either:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE is aligned with the definition in the OECD Model Tax Convention.
A non-resident person would generally be considered to have a PE in the UAE where:
A fixed or permanent place in the UAE should not be considered a PE if it is used solely for conducting activities of a preparatory or auxiliary nature.
The mere presence of a natural person in the UAE should not create a PE for a non-resident person in the following instances:
The UAE CT Law further provides an Investment Manager Exemption, which allows a UAE based investment manager (i.e. a person who provides brokerage or investment management services subject to regulatory oversight in the UAE) to be considered an independent agent when acting on behalf of a non-resident person and thus not create a PE in the UAE for a foreign investor. This is applicable to investment managers who deal in transactions involving, amongst others, commodities, real property, bonds, shares, derivative, securities, or foreign currency.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Expenditure that is not of a capital nature and is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the taxable person’s business should generally be tax deductible.
The UAE CT Law disallows / restricts the deduction of certain expenses. This is to ensure that relief can only be obtained for expenses incurred for the purpose of generating taxable income and to address possible situations of abuse or excessive deductions.
Where expenditure is incurred for more than one purpose, a deduction will be allowed for any identifiable part or proportion of the expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for deriving taxable income. Also, an appropriate proportion of any unidentifiable part or proportion of the expenses incurred for the purposes of deriving taxable income that has been determined on a fair and reasonable basis can be claimed for deduction for UAE CT purposes.
## Depreciation and amortisation
The tax depreciation/ amortisation follows the IFRS depreciation/ amortisation, except for capitalised interest which needs to be separately assessed based on interest deduction rules.
## Interest expenses
There are general interest deduction limitation rules (GIDLR) and special interest deduction limitation rules (SIDLR).
Under the GIDLR, the net interest expense (NIE) (i.e. interest expense less interest income) up to 30% of tax adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) will be deductible. However, this should not apply if the NIE for the relevant tax period does not exceed the threshold of AED 12 million. If this threshold is exceeded, the taxable person may deduct the higher of the threshold or 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA.
The following would be considered as interest:
EBITDA is mainly the taxable income adjusted for the following items:
If the EBITDA arrived at after the above calculation is negative, the amount of EBITDA to be considered for determining the 30% limit will be AED 0.
The NIE attributed to debt instruments, the terms of which were agreed prior to 9 December 2022, is exempt from the GIDLR. Also, NIE incurred by a qualifying infrastructure project person will not be subject to the GIDLR.
Interest limitation rules do not apply to banks, insurance businesses, and certain other regulated financial service entities. Also, interest limitation rules will not apply to business carried on by natural persons / individuals or any other person that may be determined by a Cabinet Decision.
The NIE amount disallowed for deduction under the interest limitation rules could be carried forward and deducted in the subsequent ten tax periods.
Under the SIDLR, no deduction shall be allowed for gross interest expenditure incurred on a loan obtained, directly or indirectly, from a related party for specific purposes:
1. A dividend or profit distribution to a related party.
2. A redemption, repurchase, reduction or return of share capital to a related party.
3. A capital contribution to a related party.
4. The acquisition of an ownership interest in a person who is or becomes a related party following the acquisition.
However, this SIDLR is not applicable where the related party lender is subject to CT or a tax of a similar character under the applicable legislation of a foreign jurisdiction on the interest at a rate not less than 9%.
## Charitable contributions
Donations paid to entities that are non-qualifying public benefit entities will not be considered as deductible for UAE CT purposes.
## Entertainment expenses
Expenses associated with entertainment of customers, shareholders, suppliers, and other business partners, such as meals, accommodation, transportation, admission fees, facilities, and equipment used for entertainment and other expenses specified by a Cabinet Decision, can be deducted up to 50% of the amount incurred.
## Other non-deductible expenses
Dividends / profit distribution and other expenses specified in a Cabinet Decision will not be considered as deductible for UAE CT purposes.
## Net operating losses
The CT Law provides that a business can offset tax losses against the taxable income of subsequent tax periods when computing the taxable income for that period. The set-off during any tax period cannot exceed 75% of the taxable income for the tax period (except in circumstances that may be prescribed in a Cabinet Decision). Any tax loss remainder can be carried forward to a further subsequent tax period indefinitely.
A taxable person cannot claim tax loss relief for losses incurred before the date of commencement of the UAE CT regime, losses incurred before it became a taxable person under the CT Law, and losses incurred from an asset or activity the income of which is exempt or otherwise not taken into account under the CT Law.
UAE CT allows transfer of tax losses between juridical tax resident group entities where there is 75% or more common ownership and where other certain conditions are met, such as having the same financial year and using the same accounting standards and not being an exempt person or QFZP.
In order to curb transfer of tax losses through transfer of ownership in case of taxable persons that are not listed on a recognised stock exchange, the CT Law provides that the tax losses can only be carried forward and utilised by a taxable person on satisfaction of the following conditions:

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
UAE group entities may elect to form a tax group provided all the following conditions are met:
When a tax group is formed, the parent entity will be responsible for the administration, such as submission of one tax return and settlement of the tax liability for the tax group.
Note that CT Group composition may be different from VAT Group composition for the same group structure as the grouping rules are different.
## Transfer pricing
The CT Law introduces transfer pricing rules and regulations. The transfer pricing regulations take immediate effect coinciding with the effective date of the corporate tax provisions.
### Arm’s-length principle
Both cross-border and domestic transactions and arrangements between related parties (including transactions undertaken by Free Zone entities) need to adhere to the arm’s-length standard (i.e. transactions must be undertaken as if they are carried out between independent parties under similar circumstances).
Furthermore, payments and benefits provided to connected persons should be at market value, which should be determined by applying the arm’s-length standard.
### Transfer pricing methods and their application
In order to determine the arm’s-length nature of the transactions between related parties, the CT Law prescribes five methods, broadly aligned with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. In case the taxable person can demonstrate that none of the prescribed methods can be reasonably applied, the taxpayer is allowed to apply any other method. In alignment with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, appropriate factors must be considered when applying the most appropriate method, namely (i) contractual terms, (ii) characteristics of the transaction, (iii) economic circumstances, (iv) functions, assets, and risks, and (v) business strategies.
### Related parties
The definition of related parties is summarised below:
In this regard, the term ‘control’ has now been defined as the ability of a person to influence another person, including the ability to:
The CT Law does not provide a clarification on how ’significant influence‘ is interpreted, and it is yet to be seen whether additional guidance will be issued and whether or not reference will be made to the interpretation as per accounting standards.
### Connected persons
Any payment or benefit provided by a taxable person to a connected person should (i) correspond to the market value of the service or benefit and (ii) be incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes in order for a deduction to be allowed. The market value should be determined by applying the arm’s-length standard. A specific exclusion on this limitation of deductibility applies in the event that the payment or benefit is provided by:
The definition of ’connected persons‘ is any of the below:
### Transfer pricing adjustments
The taxable income may be adjusted by the FTA if the results of the transaction between related parties do not fall within the arm’s-length range.
In the event of an adjustment made by the FTA or a taxable person to the taxable income, the authority will make a corresponding adjustment to the taxable income of the related party that is party to the transaction. On the other hand, where an adjustment is made by a foreign competent authority, the taxable person can apply for corresponding adjustment relief. Further guidance is awaited on the exact mechanism of implementation (e.g. potentially through a Mutual Agreement Procedure or other mechanism).
### Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)
The CT Law provides a person the option to make an application for an APA (existing or proposed transactions). Detailed guidance in this regard will be prescribed by the FTA at a later date.
### Transfer pricing documentation
1. **TP Disclosure Form:**
1. Threshold
1. Related party transactions - Aggregate value (as per financials / market value) exceeds AED 40 million, only transactions where per category value exceeds AED 4 million need to be disclosed.
2. Connected person transactions - Aggregate value exceeds AED 500,000, only transactions where per category value exceeds AED 500,000 need to be disclosed.
2. Timeline: Alongside CT return (within 9 months from the end of the relevant tax period).
2. **Master File and Local File:**
1. Threshold: Taxable person meeting either of the following conditions:
1. Constituent entity of a MNE group with a total consolidated group revenue of AED 3.15bn (approx. USD 850m) or more; or
2. The Taxable Person's revenue in the relevant tax period is AED 200m (approx. USD 55m) or more.
2. Timeline: Must be submitted within (30) thirty days following a request from the FTA.
3. **Country-by-Country Report (“CbCR”)**
1. Threshold: UAE headquartered MNE Group with consolidated revenues above AED 3.15bn.
2. Timeline: Within 12 months from the end of the reporting year of the MNE Group.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Under UAE CT Law, a branch of a non-resident person could be regarded as a PE in the UAE and the income attributable to such branch could be subject to UAE CT.
The UAE does not have a branch profits distribution tax and repatriation of profits between branches and their head offices are not subject to withholding tax (WHT) or other forms of repatriation tax in the UAE.
Separately from the UAE CT, in certain Emirates, branches of foreign banks are taxed under special Bank Tax Decrees/Laws at 20% of their adjusted taxable income. There are certain mechanisms in place to deal with avoidance of double taxation under UAE CT and Emirate tax.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
## Free Zone tax regime
Companies and branches registered in UAE Free Zones (which are more than 50 in the UAE now) are considered taxable persons under the UAE CT Law and are required to meet normal compliance obligations, including transfer pricing requirements.
However, provided a Free Zone entity meets the conditions to be considered a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP), it should be eligible for a 0% UAE CT rate on its qualifying income. At the same time, the income of a QFZP that is not qualifying income will be taxed at 9% CT rate.
In order to qualify for the 0% UAE CT rate, a QFZP must meet all of the following conditions:
Where a Free Zone person fails to meet any of the qualifying conditions set out in UAE CT Law and in the corresponding Decisions, it will be treated as a taxable person subject to 9% CT rate on its full income for the current year and next 4 years. Thereafter, it may retest its QFZP status in the 6th year.
There are comprehensive Ministerial Decision, Cabinet Decision and Guide that thoroughly regulate and explain the QFZP regime.
### Adequate substance
In order to meet the adequate substance test, the QFZP’s core income-generating activities (CIGAs) shall be undertaken in a Free Zone, and the QFZP must maintain adequate assets, adequate number of qualified employees, and incur an adequate amount of operating expenditures.
The QFZP may outsource its CIGAs to a related or third party in a Free Zone, and the QFZP must have adequate supervision of the outsourced activity. In the case of Qualifying Intellectual Property income of a QFZP, CIGAs can be outsourced to any person in the UAE, or any person outside the UAE that is not a related party.
### Qualifying income
Qualifying income includes the following:
### Excluded activities
Excluded activities include the following:
### Qualifying activities
Qualifying activities include the following:
The activity of distributing goods or materials must be undertaken in or from a Designated Zone (not ordinary Free Zone), and the goods or materials entering the UAE must be imported through the Designated Zone.
### *De minimis* requirements
The *de minimis* requirements will be satisfied where non-qualifying revenue does not exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million, whichever is lower. Non-qualifying revenue is revenue derived from excluded activities or activities that are not qualifying activities where the other party is a non-Free Zone person.
Certain revenue shall not be included in the calculation of non-qualifying revenue and total revenue. This includes revenue attributable to certain immovable property located in a Free Zone (non-commercial property, and commercial property where transactions are with non-Free Zone persons) and revenue derived from the ownership or exploitation of IP. It also includes revenue attributable to a domestic PE or a foreign PE.
### Domestic PE
The Decisions introduce the concept of a domestic PE where a QFZP has a place of business or other form of presence outside the Free Zone in the UAE. Income attributable to a domestic PE should be calculated as if the establishment were a separate and independent person and shall be subject to CT at 9%.
It is important that domestic PE (i) will not disqualify the QFZP income from 0% CT rate on qualifying income or (ii) will not be factored into the *de minimis* test (as above). A mainland branch of a QFZP is an example of a domestic PE taxed at 9% CT rate.
## Foreign tax credit
A credit is available for foreign taxes paid on a UAE taxable person’s income. The foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of UAE CT due on the relevant net  taxable income. Any unutilised foreign tax credit cannot be carried forward or back and will be lost.
## Small business relief
The UAE CT Law provides a temporary (till 31 December 2026) tax relief for small businesses. A tax resident person may elect to be treated as not having derived any taxable income where the revenue for the relevant and previous tax periods does not exceed AED 3 million during each relevant tax year. If such threshold is exceeded, then the taxable person will be subject to UAE CT at the relevant rates as provided under the CT Law.
If a tax resident person applies for ’small business relief‘, certain provisions of the CT Law will not apply, such as exempt income, reliefs, deductions, tax loss relief, and transfer pricing compliance requirements, as specified in the relevant chapters of the CT Law.
## Transfers within a qualifying group
The UAE CT Law provides tax relief on intra-group transfer of assets or liabilities between taxable persons that are members of the same qualifying group. Taxable persons will be treated as members of the same qualifying group if all the following conditions are met:
There is a clawback period of two years from the date of initial transfer in the case there is a subsequent transfer of such asset or liability outside the permitted group or where transferor or transferee ceases to be a member of the permitted group.
## Business restructuring relief
Similar to intra-group transfer of assets or liabilities within a qualifying group, the UAE CT Law provides tax relief on mergers, spin-offs, and other corporate restructuring transactions where the whole or an independent part of the business is being transferred in exchange for shares or other ownership interest, provided the following conditions are met:
There is a claw back period of two years from the date of the transfer if there is a subsequent transfer to a third party, or shares or ownership interests received are transferred or otherwise disposed of, and the gains or losses on the initial transfer will be reported in the period in which the subsequent transfer is made to the third-party.

The UAE joined the G20 / OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the 'Inclusive Framework') in 2018. Through joining the Inclusive Framework, the United Arab Emirates has committed to implement, in the immediate to short term, the following 4 BEPS minimum standards Actions:
The UAE has also committed to implement the other 11 BEPS Actions in the medium to long term.
The UAE has signed and ratified the BEPS Multilateral Instrument (MLI). The key positions that the UAE decided to adopt include:
In respect of the remaining measures included under the UAE MLI position, the UAE has opted to agree specific changes to its DTTs through bilateral negotiation.
## BEPS 2.0 Pillar Two and DMTT in the UAE
On 9 December 2024, the UAE Ministry of Finance announced updates in relation to UAE CT Law. These include:
The Pillar Two rules require large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits in every country where they operate. The DMTT will apply to multinational enterprises operating in the UAE with consolidated global revenues of EUR750 million or more in at least two out of the four financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which the DMTT applies. The UAE’s implementation of the DMTT will closely align with the OECD’s GloBE Model Rules.
Further, Cabinet Decision No. 142 of 31 December 2024 introduced the detailed legislation on the UAE DMTT including cases, provisions, conditions, rules, controls, and procedures. It is broadly aligned with the OECD’s Inclusive Framework (IF).
The UAE continues to enhance its business-friendly environment, reflecting its commitment to national strategic objectives such as strengthening economic competitiveness and improving ease of doing business. To promote sustainable growth, innovation, and investment, the Ministry of Finance is currently considering the introduction of the following Corporate Tax Incentives under Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022.
Another incentive being considered is a refundable tax credit for high-value employment activities. This aims to encourage businesses to engage in activities that deliver significant economic benefits, stimulate innovation, and enhance the UAE’s global competitiveness. This incentive is proposed to take effect from 1 January 2025 and will be granted as a percentage of eligible salary costs for employees engaged in high-value employment activities. This includes C-suite executives and other senior personnel performing core business functions that add substantial value to the UAE economy.
The final form and implementation of the above mentioned proposed incentives are subject to legislative approvals.
## Economic substance regulations
### In scope entities
The Economic Substance Regulations (ESR) apply to all UAE Licensees that undertook  one or more of the "Relevant Activities" during the ESR Period, i.e. only for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019 and ending on or before 31 December 2022.
The "Relevant Activities" are listed below:
Only the licensees that undertake a "Relevant Activity" and earn income from such "Relevant Activity" during the ESR Period are required to satisfy the applicable economic substance test. The ESR does not apply to non-UAE tax resident entities, investment funds and their underlying holding entities (except for self-managed investment funds), wholly UAE resident owned UAE entities with domestic transactions only (that are not part of a multinational group), and UAE branches of foreign companies that are subject to the corporate tax on all their “Relevant Income” in a foreign jurisdiction.
### Compliance requirements
There are two filing requirements, being:
The notification and substance report should be submitted electronically via the MoF online portal within 6 and 12 months of the financial year end of the UAE Licensee, respectively. These filings must be made on an annual basis, if applicable.
### Consequences of non-compliance
In addition to exchanging information with foreign authorities and the ultimate parent and beneficial owners of the UAE Licensee, failure to demonstrate adequate substance would result in administrative penalties (AED 50,000 in the first year of failure, increased to an amount of AED 400,000 for a consecutive year of failure). Additional penalties, such as suspending, revoking, or not renewing the UAE Licensee’s trade or commercial licence, could also apply.
Other administrative penalties include: (i) AED 20,000 for failure to submit the notification; (ii) AED 50,000 for failure to submit the annual substance report, as well as deemed failure to meet the economic substance test; and (iii) AED 50,000 for providing inaccurate information, as well as deemed failure of the economic substance test.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In 2015, the United Arab Emirates signed the Model 1B Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States, which came into force in 2016 (US-UAE Model 1 IGA), with the US Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regarding the exchange of information related to US individuals and certain type of US-owned entities, with an effective date of 1 July 2014.
The domestic legislative provisions to implement FATCA in the United Arab Emirates are set in Cabinet Resolution No. 63 of 2022 (UAE FATCA Regulations).
The exchange of information is conducted on an annual basis, occurring in September of each year, between the UAE competent authority and the US IRS. UAE reporting financial institutions for FATCA purposes need to submit their FATCA returns to their relevant financial regulator (or the UAE MoF for unregulated entities) by 30 June of each year (unless otherwise informed). Filing of nil reports is required under FATCA.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
In 2017, the UAE signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, and the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) was signed in 2017.
The exchange of information is conducted on an annual basis, occurring in September of each year, between the UAE competent authority and competent authorities of jurisdictions which have agreed to exchange information with the UAE.
The domestic legislative provisions to implement the CRS in the United Arab Emirates are set in Cabinet Resolution No. 93 of 2021 (UAE CRS Regulations).
UAE reporting financial institutions for CRS purposes need to submit their CRS returns to their relevant financial regulators (or the UAE MoF for unregulated entities) by 30 June of each year (unless otherwise informed). Filing of nil reports is required under the CRS.

# United Arab Emirates
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 February 2025
Under the Emirate-level tax decrees, income tax is payable under a progressive rate system, with rates up to 55%. However, in practice, these tax decrees have not been applied. Instead, branches of foreign banks are subject to income tax at a flat rate of 20% under separate Emirate-level bank decrees. Companies engaged in UAE oil and gas and petrochemical activities are subject to income tax at varying rates under their individual UAE concession agreements or fiscal letters.
The Federal UAE CT Law, which is effective for each taxable person’s new financial year beginning on or after 1 June 2023, is applicable across all Emirates and applies to all business and commercial activities, except to the following exempt persons (subject to conditions):
UAE CT is applicable at the following rates:
| Taxable income | UAE CT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| * Taxable income not exceeding 375,000 UAE dirham (AED). * Qualifying income of a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP).\* | 0 |
| * Taxable income exceeding AED 375,000. * Non-qualifying income of a QFZP. | 9 |
\* *Please refer to Free Zones in the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section**.*
