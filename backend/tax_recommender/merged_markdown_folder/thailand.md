## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market price. Any recognised method of ascertaining the cost price may be used, but a change in the method may only be made with the prior approval of the Director-General of the Revenue Department.
## Capital gains
There is no specific legislation governing capital gains. Except as noted below, all capital gains earned by a Thai company are treated as ordinary revenue for tax purposes. Capital gains on the sale of investments derived from or in Thailand by a foreign company not carrying on business in Thailand are subject to a tax of 15%, withheld at source by the purchaser, unless otherwise exempt under a DTT.
The following gains earned by a foreign company not carrying on business in Thailand are also subject to 15% WHT:
Capital gains received by a Thai company and a foreign company carrying on business in Thailand from the sale of fund units in a fixed income mutual fund are exempt from tax. This is subject to the condition that the cost of the investment and expenses in relation to the exempt income are not claimed as tax deductible expenses.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a company listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from another Thai company are exempt from tax provided that the shares are held for at least three months before and three months after the dividend was received.
Dividends received by a non-listed company from another Thai company are also exempt from tax provided that the company receiving the dividend holds at least 25% of the total shares with voting rights, without any direct or indirect cross-shareholding, and has held the shares for at least three months before and three months after the dividend was received. However, if the shares are held for this period but the 25% shareholding and cross-shareholding conditions are not met, only one-half of the dividend is exempt from tax.
In the case of an amalgamation (merger) or an entire business transfer (EBT), the new or surviving company can include the period of ownership of any predecessor company that was part of the amalgamation or EBT when counting the above three-month period.
Dividends received from foreign investments are exempt from tax if the Thai company receiving the dividends holds at least 25% of the shares with voting rights of the company paying the dividends for a period of not less than six months before the date on which the dividend was received and the dividend was derived from the net profit in the foreign country taxed at a rate of not less than 15%. In the event that a ‘special law’ in a particular foreign country provides a reduced tax rate or exemption for the net profit, the limited company that receives the dividends is still eligible for the tax exemption.
The share of profits received by a Thai company or a foreign company carrying on business in Thailand from an unincorporated joint venture carrying on business in Thailand is exempt from tax.
In addition, the following profit sharing from mutual funds is exempt from tax:
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are taxable to the recipient as ordinary income.
## Interest income
Interest is taxable as income on the accrual basis.
## Royalty income
Royalties are taxable as income on the accrual basis.
## Foreign income
Companies incorporated in Thailand are taxed on worldwide income. The foreign income received by a company incorporated in Thailand is taxable on the accrual basis. Double taxation is relieved by way of a credit against the tax chargeable in Thailand (*see Foreign tax credit in the [Tax credits and incentives](thailand/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Companies incorporated in Thailand are taxed on worldwide income. A company incorporated abroad (i.e. a company organised under foreign laws or a foreign company) is taxed on its profits arising from or in consequence of the business carried on in Thailand.
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 20%.
A foreign company not carrying on business in Thailand is subject to a final WHT on certain types of assessable income (e.g. interest, dividends, royalties, rentals, and service fees) paid from or in Thailand. The rate of tax is generally 15%, except for dividends, which is 10%, while other rates may apply under the provisions of a double tax treaty (DTT).
## Rates for companies with low paid-in capital and income
Companies and juristic partnerships with paid-in capital not exceeding 5 million Thai baht (THB) at the end of any accounting period and income from the sale of goods and/or the provision of services not exceeding THB 30 million are subject to tax at the following rates:
| Net profit (THB) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 300,000 | 0 |
| 300,001 to 3 million | 15 |
| Over 3 million | 20 |
## Petroleum income tax
International oil companies can engage in exploration and production activities in Thailand under a concession, a production sharing contract, or a service contract.
Taxation on income from petroleum operations is imposed on petroleum concessionaire companies and production sharing producers by the Petroleum Income Tax Acts (PITA). Petroleum companies under a service contract are not taxed under the PITA but under the Revenue Code.
Companies taxed under the PITA are exempt from taxes and duties on income imposed under the Revenue Code and under any other laws. The exemption applies provided that the company pays taxes and duties on income subject to the PITA or on dividends paid out of income subject to the PITA.
Petroleum companies under a concession are taxed at the rate of 50% of their annual net profit from petroleum operations, including profit from the transfer of their concession interests and other activities incidental to the petroleum operations. Deductions are allowed for ‘ordinary and necessary’ business expenses, as well as depreciation of capital expenditure, petroleum royalties, and other charges. Certain types of expenses are specifically disallowed for deduction, including interest.
A production sharing producer is taxed at the rate of 20% of its annual net profit derived from its petroleum business, including profits derived from the transfer of interests in the nature of rights, annuity, or any other recurring income as a consequence thereof.
Petroleum companies subject to PITA, including companies that have entered into a production sharing contract, can adopt (with the permission of the Director-General) a foreign functional currency for preparing its accounting books and records and keep them in a foreign language. Where this is adopted, the foreign functional currency must be used when calculating the net profit subject to petroleum income tax.
## Local income taxes
There are no local government taxes on income in Thailand.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Tax period
The tax year for a company is its accounting period, which must be of 12 months’ duration. However, it may be less than 12 months in the case of the first accounting period after incorporation, the accounting period of dissolution, or after approval for a change in the accounting period has been received from the Revenue Department and the Business Development Department.
## Tax returns
The tax system is one of self-assessment. A company prepares and files its tax returns by the due dates and at the same time pays the taxes calculated to be due. The annual CIT return is due 150 days from the closing date of the accounting period.
A half-year CIT return must be filed within two months after the end of the first six months of an accounting period. The tax is computed on one-half of the estimated profit for the full accounting period, except for listed companies, banks, certain other financial institutions, and other companies under prescribed conditions, where the tax is based on the actual net profit for the first six months.
## Payment of tax
CIT is paid twice in each year at the time of filing the tax returns as above. The balance of the tax due is payable within 150 days from the closing date of the accounting period. Credit is given for the amount of tax paid at the half-year.
## Tax audit process
If, within a period of two years from the date of filing a tax return, the assessment officer has reason to believe that false or inadequate information has been declared in a return, the assessment officer has the power to issue a summons requesting the presence of the person responsible, or a witness, for examination, and to order either of them to produce accounts or other relevant evidence, provided that advance notice of seven days is given. The subsequent examination of the books and records is normally carried out at the company's offices if it is inconvenient to transfer all the documents to the tax office. After completion of the examination, the assessment officer has the power to adjust the amounts previously assessed or included in a return on the basis of the evidence, and issue a further assessment for tax together with penalties and surcharges, or adjust the amount of losses available for carryforward.
Tax audits may cover the previous five accounting periods from the date of filing a tax return with the approval of the Director-General if the assessment officer has evidence of an intention to evade tax or in the case of a claim for a refund of tax. However, under the Civil and Commercial Code, the Revenue Department can assess tax for up to ten years.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax is ten years.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Thailand, a country located in Southeast Asia, is bordered by Myanmar to the north and northwest, Lao PDR and Cambodia to the east, Malaysia and the Gulf of Thailand to the south, and the Andaman Sea to the southwest. A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known originally as Siam, the country was renamed Thailand (Land of the Free) in 1939. Thailand’s population is currently 70 million, its capital city is Bangkok, its currency is the baht (THB), and the official language is Thai.
Thailand is Southeast Asia’s second largest economy after Indonesia. With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise economy, and generally pro-investment policies, Thailand historically has had a strong economy. However, since 2019, the economy has declined due to weaker demand for exports reflecting the impact of US-China trade tensions, slowing public investments, the COVID-19 pandemic, and a drought impacting agricultural production. In 2020, the economy declined by 6.2%. This was followed by a recovery in 2021 with a growth of 1.6%, which included an increase in the export of goods by 18.8%, private consumption by 0.3%, and investment by 3.4%. Inflation for 2021 was 1.2%. A growth of 3.5% to 4.5% is currently forecast for 2022.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard rate of VAT is 10%, but the rate is currently reduced to 7% until 30 September 2025 (unless further extended by the government). VAT is levied on the sale of goods and the provision of services. Exports are zero-rated, while a number of goods and services are exempt (e.g. basic groceries, education, healthcare, interest, leasing of immovable property, sale of real estate).
Non-resident electronic service providers and electronic platform operators who receive income of more than THB 1.8 million per year from providing electronic services to non-VAT registered customers in Thailand must register for VAT, file VAT returns, and pay VAT (without deducting input tax) via the Revenue Department’s online system. These taxpayers are not required to issue tax invoices or prepare input tax reports. The following are the key conditions for VAT collection:
## Specific business tax
Specific business tax is collected at fixed rates on the gross revenue of certain businesses not subject to VAT, such as commercial banking, similar financial businesses, and the sale of immovable property, which are taxed at 3%, and life insurance, which is taxed at 2.5%.
The rate of specific business tax has been reduced to 0.01% for certain revenue derived by commercial banks and finance, securities, and credit foncier businesses, as well as businesses that have regular transactions similar to commercial banking.
An additional 10% of the tax is levied as municipality tax.
## Customs duties
### Basis of taxation
Customs duties are imposed under the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Decree and are collected on both imports and a limited number of exports. Classification of imports is based on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (the so-called 'Harmonised System'). Thailand has adopted the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN) 2022, which is based on the Harmonised System 2022, as its import tariff nomenclature.
Duties are levied on a specific or an *ad valorem* basis, whichever is higher, and the applied *ad valorem* duties range between 0% and 80%. Exemptions from import duties are available on particular items of goods as prescribed in the Customs Tariff Decree. Preferential duty rates are available on imported goods from countries that have a preferential free trade agreement (FTA) with Thailand.
Currently, Thailand has FTAs with the following countries:
Also, as a member of ASEAN, Thailand has preferential trade agreements with the following countries:
Generally, the value of imports is based on their cost, insurance, and freight (CIF), whereas exported goods are based on their free on board (FOB) amount.
Thailand has implemented the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Valuation Agreement. The primary basis for the customs value is the transaction value, which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export, subject to adjustments for certain elements that are considered to form a part of the value for customs purposes or that can be deducted from the value of the imported goods (e.g. the cost of transportation after the importation, duties, and taxes associated with the import).
Elements that may need to be added include royalties and licence fees that are related to the goods and paid as a condition of sale, proceeds from subsequent resale in the importing country, and the value of goods or services supplied by the buyer, such as design or development fees related to the imported goods. If the declared price is evidently low or is unlikely to be the true value of the goods, Thai Customs will likely dispute the declared price.
### Customs controls and procedures
Customs procedures for goods arriving in Thailand in any manner are similar to those existing in most other countries. An importer is required to file an entry form together with other requisite documents, including a bill of lading, invoice, and packing list via the e-Customs system.
Customs duties are due upon the arrival of the vessel carrying the imported goods, and goods may be stored in a customs warehouse for up to 45 days with no submission of an import entry and 60 days in the case of submission of an import entry. Landing and storage charges must be paid before the goods are released.
### Customs incentives schemes
Various customs incentives schemes, each with its own specific conditions and duty privileges, are available, including the following:
### Offences and penalties
Although, technically, an offence against the customs law is a criminal offence, in practice, legal procedures are usually concerned with the recovery of tax arrears and fines. Offences include non-compliance with customs procedures, false declarations, and the most serious offence of smuggling and evasion of customs duties. Statutory penalties are as prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Customs Act. Where Customs and the offender agree to settle the case at the Customs level (i.e. waiver of prosecution), the penalties would be in accordance with the settlement criteria as prescribed by the Director-General of the Customs Department. Currently, we understand that a duty evasion offence would typically be settled with a fine of from 50% to 200% based on the duty shortfall per the import entry. The VAT penalty would also be applied proportionally based on the duty fine. Duty and VAT surcharges (capped at the amount of the shortfall) are applied in this respect as well.
For import licensing errors, the settlement criteria would be the surrendering of the goods or a fine in lieu thereof based on the value of the goods. For offences related to smuggling, the penalties are based on a multiple of the value of the goods.
## Excise tax
### Basis of taxation
Excise tax (ET) is a form of consumption tax that is imposed on the sale of a selected range of services and goods (whether manufactured locally or imported) that are considered ‘luxuries and/or having environmental impacts’. The tax liability arises on locally manufactured goods when leaving the factory and at the time of importation for imported goods.
The excise tax calculation is based on both *ad valorem* rates (a percentage of the suggested retail price [SRP]) and/or specific rates (based on the quantity or weight of the goods). The excise tax formula varies depending on type of excise taxable products, for example:
### Taxable goods and services
| Goods/services | Ad valorem rate (%) | Specific rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Petroleum and petroleum products | 0 | THB 0 to THB 6.5 per litre or kilogram |
| Certain non-alcoholic beverages | 0 to 14 | THB 0 to THB 44 per litre |
| Certain electrical appliances | 0 | - |
| Batteries | 0 to 8 | - |
| Crystal glassware | 0 | - |
| Motor vehicles | 0 to 40 | - |
| Motorcycles | 0 to 20 | - |
| Boats | 0 | - |
| Perfume products and cosmetics | 0 to 8 | - |
| Woollen carpets | 0 | - |
| Marble and granite | 0 | - |
| Ozone depleting substances/CFCs | 0 to 30 | - |
| Alcoholic beverages | 0 to 22 | THB 0 to THB 1,500 per litre of pure alcohol |
| Cigarettes containing tobacco | 0 to 42 | THB 0.005 to THB 1.25 per piece or gram |
| Playing cards | 0 | THB 2 to THB 30 per 100 cards |
| Entertainment services | 0 to 10 | - |
| Race courses and lotto | 0 to 20 | - |
| Golf courses | 0 to 10 | - |
| Telecommunications business | 0 | - |
In addition to the excise tax, an interior tax is also levied by the Excise Department at the rate of 10% of the excise tax payable. Other taxes, such as the health tax, Thai Public Broadcasting Service tax (TPBS tax or TV tax), and the elderly fund tax, may apply to certain specified products in the categories of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.
The manufacturer of the products must file a return and remit the tax due prior to taking the goods from the factory or bonded warehouse. If a VAT liability arises before the goods are taken out of these locations, the manufacturer must file a return and remit the excise tax to the Excise Department within 15 days from the end of the month.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is levied on 28 different types of documents and instruments, including contracts for hire of work, loans, share transfers, leases of land or buildings, and insurance policies. The rate of stamp duty varies depending on the type of document but ranges from THB 1 per THB 1,000 of value on most contracts and agreements to a fixed amount per instrument on most commercial and other documents.
Most instruments subject to stamp duty that are in the form of e-instruments are required to be filed and have the stamp duty paid in cash via the Internet. In this case, the filing of the return and payment can be made before the execution of the instrument or within 15 days from the date following that on which the instrument was executed.
Failure to pay the stamp duty and affix the stamps on a timely basis is subject to a surcharge ranging from 200% to 600% of the duty payable. Unstamped documents or instruments are not admissible as evidence in a civil lawsuit.
## Capital taxes
There are no capital taxes in Thailand.
## Payroll taxes
An employer is responsible for withholding personal income tax (PIT) from all salaries and benefits paid to or on behalf of an employee and remitting such tax to the Revenue Department within seven days from the end of the month in which the salaries and benefits were paid.
## Social security contributions
Contributions are levied at the rate of 5% of the monthly salary of each employee, subject to a maximum levy per employee of THB 750 per month. These contributions are payable by both the employer and employee.
## Local taxes
### Land and building tax
An individual or juristic person who owns or possesses land or buildings is subject to the land and building tax. Condominium units and rafts are included within the definition of buildings.
The tax base is the value of the land, building, or condominium unit as appraised for the collection of fees by the relevant government authority for registrations under the Land Code.
The tax is levied on an annual (calendar year) basis, and the local municipal authority will send a tax assessment letter to the taxpayer before the end of February each year. The taxpayer must pay the tax so assessed before the end of April each year.
The statutory maximum tax rates range from 0.15% to 3%, depending on the purpose of use. However, the actual rates to be applied each year are published in a royal decree, although a municipal administrative body is empowered to prescribe tax rates higher than those published in the royal decree provided that the rates do not exceed the statutory maximum rates.
### Signboard tax
Signboard tax is levied annually on certain commercial signs or billboards at varying rates according to the size and language used. There are higher rates imposed for text that moves or changes. The rates per 500 square centimetres are THB 5 to THB 10 if all words are in Thai, THB 26 to THB 52 if both Thai and foreign words are used, and THB 50 to THB 52 if only foreign words are used or if the Thai words are below the foreign words.

A company incorporated abroad is subject to CIT in Thailand if it is considered to be carrying on business in Thailand. The term ‘carrying on business in Thailand’ is broad and, subject to the provisions of a DTT, includes the presence of an employee, representative, or go-between that results in the foreign company deriving income or gains in Thailand.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Depreciation, amortisation, and depletion
Deductions for depreciation are allowed as a percentage of cost. If the rate of deduction adopted by a company under its own accounting method is lower than the maximum percentage of cost permitted, a deduction will be allowed only at the rate adopted by the company. The straight-line basis is the method most commonly used by companies, but any generally accepted basis, such as sum-of-the-years-digits or double-declining method, is permitted. The maximum permitted rates are shown below:
| Asset | Maximum permitted rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings: |  |
| Durable buildings | 5 |
| Temporary buildings | 100 |
| Cost of acquisition of depletable natural resources | 5 |
| Cost of acquisition of lease rights: |  |
| If there is no written lease agreement or if there is a written lease agreement containing a renewal clause whereby continual renewals are permitted | 10 |
| If there is a written lease agreement containing no renewal clause or containing a renewal clause but restricting renewable periods to a definitely limited duration | Percentage rate equals 100 divided by the sum of years of the original and renewable lease periods |
| Cost of acquisition of the right in a process, formula, goodwill, trademark, business licence, patent, copyright, or any other right: |  |
| If the period of use is unlimited | 10 |
| If the period of use is limited | Percentage rate equals 100 divided by the number of years of use |
| Other assets not mentioned above, excluding land and inventory | 20 |
### Special depreciation methods for certain assets
### Special depreciation method for small companies
Companies and juristic partnerships with fixed assets, excluding land, with a value of no more than THB 200 million and with no more than 200 employees are entitled to use the following special depreciation methods:
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses, such as incorporation expenses and registration fees, are deductible when incurred.
## Interest expenses
Interest on money borrowed for the purpose of acquiring profit or for the purpose of the business is deductible. Interest incurred in respect of the construction or installation of fixed assets that require a period of time before they are ready for their intended use is considered to be capital expenditure and deductible in the form of depreciation.
## Bad debts
Bad debts written off are deductible, provided that they are consistent with the rules, procedures, and conditions prescribed by ministerial regulations.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to specified charities or for public benefit are deductible in the amount actually paid but not exceeding 2% of net profit. Donations for education or sport are also deductible in the amount actually paid but not exceeding 2% of net profit.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and surcharges imposed under all tax laws are not deductible.
## Taxes
In general, all taxes are deductible except CIT and VAT (in certain cases).
## Other significant items
Non-deductible expenses include, but are not limited to, the following:
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward to offset against the profits of the following five accounting periods. The carryback of losses is not permitted. A change in control of a loss-making company does not impact its loss carryforward status.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A company incorporated in Thailand may claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges, provided they are expended exclusively for the purpose of generating profit or for the purpose of the business and are determined on an arm’s-length basis.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Group taxation is not permitted in Thailand.
## Transfer pricing
On 21 November 2018, Thailand introduced specific transfer pricing provisions into the income tax law, which apply to accounting periods that started on or after 1 January 2019.
The transfer pricing rules adopt the arm’s-length principle. Revenue officers have the power to uplift or reduce taxpayers’ revenue and expenses to the arm’s-length price. Where transfer pricing adjustments result in a tax shortfall, a secondary adjustment that arises from imposing tax on a constructive transaction, either in the form of a deemed dividend or deemed loan, would also apply.
The legislation also requires mandatory annual transfer pricing reporting for taxpayers belonging to a group of companies (‘applicable taxpayers’). Entities with an annual total revenue of THB 200 million or less are exempt from the transfer pricing information reporting requirements.
There are two levels of transfer pricing information reporting, as follows:
A penalty of up to THB 200,000 for each level of transfer pricing reporting will be imposed in the case where taxpayers fail to comply with the reporting requirements (by way of inaccurate or incomplete disclosure of information).
The detailed content requirements of the transfer pricing documentation were issued on 30 September 2021 and are applicable for accounting periods that started on or after 1 January 2021. The new content requirements are largely in line with those suggested by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) local file requirements. However, transfer pricing documentation must be submitted in the Thai language. It also remains unclear whether Thailand’s transfer pricing documentation now only comprises the local file as there is no mention of the master file.
The content requirements apply to entities for the financial year starting on or after 1 January 2021, but the reporting requirements have been in place since 1 January 2019. What this means is that, for the financial years starting between 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020, taxpayers may follow either Thailand’s internal guidelines on transfer pricing (Departmental Instruction Paw. 113/2545) when preparing transfer pricing documentation or the OECD local file requirements.
The Revenue Department will use the transfer pricing disclosure form to select audit targets. Once selected, they will request the full transfer pricing documentation for review. In the case where the transfer pricing practices adopted by the taxpayer do not comply with the arm’s-length principle, Revenue officers will make the necessary adjustments and assess additional taxes, surcharges, and penalties.
Although smaller entities with revenue of THB 200 million or less are exempt from the transfer pricing information reporting requirements, they will still be obligated to ensure that their transfer pricing practices are at arm’s length.
Thailand also introduced the country-by-country reporting (CbCR) requirements to be applicable for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2021. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) with total consolidated revenues exceeding THB 28 billion carrying on business in Thailand are required to file the CbC report in Thailand if they do not meet the local filing exemption conditions. The Revenue Department also allows a foreign company to designate a Thai entity to be its surrogate parent entity and file a CbC report on behalf of the group, with certain conditions to be met.
The CbC report is required to be filed online within 12 months from the financial year-end in the case where the ultimate parent entity of a Thai MNE is the filing entity and within 60 days upon request in the case where the filing entity falls under the local filing conditions. Each MNE group operating in Thailand and meeting the CbCR threshold must select a representative entity to file a CbC notification online with the Revenue Department.
A fine of THB 2,000 will be imposed on a taxpayer that fails to file the CbC report by the due date.
The transfer pricing rules endorse the use of five transfer pricing methods in determining the arm’s-length compensation for a controlled transaction, which are the comparable uncontrolled price, resale price, cost plus, transactional net margin, and transactional profit split methods.
The regulation on transfer pricing also provides brief guidelines for benchmarking whereby internal comparables (i.e. the same or similar transactions that a taxpayer has with unrelated parties) must be considered before external comparables (i.e. the same or similar transactions between independent third parties).
There remains some ambiguity around the interpretation of ‘relationship’ and ‘control’ under the definition of ‘related parties’ in the main provision. We expect to see more guidance on this interpretation in the pending subordinate regulation.
The Revenue Department will still be able to assess tax on transfer pricing irregularities for periods that started before 1 January 2019 as the statute of limitations in this case is five years. For those periods, the general income tax provisions, which require taxpayers to transact at market price, would be referred to. The transfer pricing documentation should then follow the requirements under the Departmental Instruction Paw. 113/2545 and be prepared and submitted upon request on a voluntary basis.
To resolve, or even avoid, transfer pricing disputes, Thailand accepts Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAPs) to eliminate or mitigate double taxation from cross-border transactions. Only companies or partnerships incorporated in Thailand that engage in intra-group transactions with related parties who are residents of Thailand’s treaty partners are eligible for MAPs or bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs).
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules. However, for certain businesses or as part of the conditions for granting tax incentives, a certain debt-to-equity ratio may be required.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no tax provisions in respect of CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Branches of foreign corporations are subject to CIT on locally earned profits only. Branch profits remitted to the foreign head office are subject to an additional tax at the rate of 10%. However, this is a tax on the disposition of profits abroad and is not limited to remittances. For example, a credit of profit to the head office account in the books is held to be a disposition of profit abroad even though no remittance of funds has taken place.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Board of Investment (BOI) tax incentives
The BOI, by virtue of the Investment Promotion Act of 1977 (including its amendment no. 4 [2017]) and the Competitive Enhancement Act (2017), provides tax incentives for certain activities within the following categories:
The tax incentives available include the following:
### Incentives by category
Under the 2024 BOI promotion scheme, the focus is placed on the activities and the importance of the activities. Tax incentives are under the five technology and innovation development categories (A1+ to A4) and non-tax incentives are under category B, as below:
| Group | CIT exemption | Import duty exemption on machinery | Import duty exemption on raw materials for export | Non-tax incentives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1+ | 10-13 years (without cap) + merit\* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A1 | 8 years (without cap) + merit\* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A2 | 8 years + merit \* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A3 | 5 years + merit | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| A4 | 3 years + merit | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| B | Merit (1-5 years) \*\* | Yes | Yes | Yes |
\* Exemption from CIT will be up to 13 years in total.
\*\* Only some activities are available, provided that certain criteria are fulfilled.
### Merit on competitiveness enhancement
The investment or expenses permitted are as follows:
| Investment in | Additional investment cap (% of investment or expenses incurred) |
| --- | --- |
| Technology and innovation: |  |
| Licensing fees for using domestically developed technology. | 200 |
| Product and package design. | 200 |
| Human resource development: |  |
| Advanced technology training. | 200 |
| Organising training or accepting student internships for work training and skill development during their science and technology education. | 200 |
| Development of business operators’ potentials: |  |
| Local supplier development. | 200 |
### Additional years of tax exemption will be added to the standard tax incentives received as follows:
| Investment/expenditure based on the sales revenue in the first 3 years | Additional period of tax exemption with cap based on amount of investment (in total, maximum period is 13 years)\* |
| --- | --- |
| ≥ 1% or ≥ THB 200 million | 1 year |
| ≥ 2% or ≥ THB 400 million | 2 years |
| ≥ 3% or ≥ THB 600 million | 3 years |
| ≥ 4% or ≥ THB 800 million | 4 years |
| ≥ 5% or ≥ THB 600 million | 5 years |
### Merit on decentralisation
Investment promotion zones have been included as a decentralisation merit to businesses that have operations in any of the following 20 provinces with low average income:
Kalasin, Chaiyaphum, Nakhon Phanom, Nan, Bung Karn, Buriram, Phrae, Maha Sarakham, Mukdahan, Mae Hong Son, Yasothon, Roi Et, Sisaket, Sakhon Nakhon, Sa Kaew, Sukhothai, Surin, Nong Bua Lamphu, Ubon Ratchatani, and Amnatcharoen.
Additional incentives for enterprises located in these 20 provinces include the following:
### Merit on industrial area development
One additional year of CIT exemption will be granted to Group A projects located within an industrial estate or promoted industrial zone. However, the total period of CIT exemption will not exceed eight years, except for the activities under A1+ that can obtain additional years of CIT exemption up to 13 years.
### Special economic zone (SEZ)
Tax incentives available for investment in eligible target and general activities in an SEZ are as follows:
To be eligible for the tax privileges, a number of general and specific conditions are required to be fulfilled, including the use of modern production processes and new machinery, paid-up share capital at the required amount, adequate environment protection systems, debt-to-equity ratio not exceeding 3:1, and the required area to operate the business.
### Tax incentives given to R&D contractors
R&D is a promoted activity under the Investment Promotion Act, which prescribes the criteria and conditions to be followed by an R&D contractor.
Tax incentives given are as follows:
The R&D services must be of the following description:
### Tax benefits under the Revenue Code
The Revenue Code provides for an additional 100% deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in Thailand on R&D for technology and innovation (including product and process innovation) when hiring government agencies or the private sector, as approved by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.
## Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC)
Under the Eastern Economic Corridor Act (2018) (EEC Act), an EEC project must be located in certain zones within the EEC, which consists of the three Eastern provinces of Rayong, Chonburi, and Chachoengsao. An EEC project will be promoted only if it is engaged in a target industry.
An EEC-promoted company will be granted CIT exemption and/or reduction privileges according to the criteria prescribed by the EEC committee. Currently, the CIT privileges under the EEC Act have not been announced.
Nevertheless, the BOI, under the Investment Promotion Act, has already issued criteria and incentives for promoted activities located in the EEC. The tax incentives are categorised under three zones, as follows:
Only eligible activities under categories A1+-A4 (except for those specified in a negative list) and enabling services can be applied for.
Tax incentives\* provided by the BOI are as follows:
\* Subject to qualified human resources, the development of R&D activities, and the location of the project.
Note that EEC incentives cannot be utilised together with those under the merit of industrial area development.
The EEC Act also grants a PIT reduction for employees with special knowledge/abilities who work or operate a business in certain zones within the EEC.
Qualified expatriates and Thai employees are granted a flat rate of 17% PIT on their income derived from working for companies carrying on target activities within the EEC.
## International business centre (IBC)
An international business centre (IBC) regime has been launched to replace the previous regional operating headquarters (ROH), international headquarters (IHQ), and international trade centre (ITC) regimes.
The criteria for the establishment and operation of an IBC are as follows:
Treasury management services comprise the following:
ITC means the international business of buying and selling goods, which may include the provision of services related to the goods purchased and sold. These services include the following:
Income of the IBC means the following:
The following tax benefits are available for 15 accounting periods:
In comparison with the previous ROH/IHQ regimes, the IBC regime does not apply different tax rates to offshore and onshore income. As a consequence, there is no longer any requirement for services to be provided to a minimum number of offshore affiliates. There is also no limit to the amount of onshore income that qualifies for the reduced tax rates. The expenditure required to qualify for the reduced tax rates has been significantly increased. However, in the case where an existing ROH/IHQ converts to be an IBC, it can enjoy the reduced tax rate of 8% provided that it meets the original minimum expenditure requirement of THB 15 million.
If an IBC does not meet the rules and conditions prescribed or does not otherwise qualify as an IBC in any accounting period, the benefits will be revoked on a year-by-year basis. If the company does not meet the conditions for more than one accounting period, or has none of the characteristics for operating as an IBC, the tax benefits will be terminated with effect from the first accounting period.
The taxable profit and loss of an IBC must be computed separately between the IBC and non-IBC businesses and between (i) headquarters and treasury management services, and (ii) royalties. Common expenses are to be allocated based on the proportion of revenue of the IBC and non-IBC businesses.
Tax losses must be maintained separately, as follows:
Tax returns must be filed separately for (i) headquarters and treasury management services, (ii) royalties, and (iii) non-IBC business.
## Foreign tax credit
A Thai company can use foreign tax paid on business income or dividends as a credit against its CIT liability. However, the credit cannot exceed the amount of Thai tax on the income.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Employment expenses
A standard deduction of 50%, with a limit of THB 100,000, is permitted in respect of income from employment. Business deductions are not available against employment income.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations in the following categories are deductible in the amount donated but not exceeding 10% of net income after all allowances and deductions:
All donations in the following categories are allowed a double deduction to the extent that the combined amount does not exceed 10% of net income (assessable income after allowances and deductions):
### Life insurance premiums
Life insurance premiums, in an amount not exceeding THB 100,000, paid by a taxpayer on one's own life are allowed as a deduction, provided that the insurance policies are for a minimum period of ten years and the insurer is carrying on a life insurance business in Thailand. If the policy includes a savings plan that provides an annual return to the policy holder exceeding 20% of the annual premium, the entire premium will be non-deductible.
Qualified pension life insurance premiums paid to a Thai insurer are available as a deduction in an amount not exceeding 15% of total assessable income with a maximum of THB 200,000. However, this allowance, together with the contribution to a registered provident fund, the civil servant pension fund, the teacher's welfare fund, and the investment in retirement mutual funds and super savings funds, may not exceed THB 500,000 in the same tax year.
In addition, the amount paid, up to a maximum of THB 10,000, for a life insurance premium for the taxpayer's spouse who does not earn income is also allowed, provided the marital status exists throughout the tax year.
### Health insurance premiums
A health insurance premium, up to a maximum of THB 25,000, paid to a life or non-life insurance company in Thailand by a taxpayer for one's own health is allowed as a deduction. However, the deduction for this premium together with the above life insurance premiums paid cannot exceed THB 100,000 in total.
A health insurance premium, up to a maximum of THB 15,000, paid to a life or non-life insurance company in Thailand for the taxpayer's parents or the parents of the spouse of the taxpayer is allowed as a deduction.
### Expenses for antenatal care and child delivery
A deduction of up to THB 60,000 for each pregnancy is allowed for expenses paid by the taxpayer or spouse for antenatal care and child delivery. If the expenses for each pregnancy are not paid in the same tax year, the amount actually paid in each tax year is allowed, but in total no more than THB 60,000.
### Mortgage interest expenses
Mortgage interest incurred for the purpose of purchase or construction of a residential building in Thailand may be deducted up to a maximum of THB 100,000.
### Retirement mutual fund contribution
A contribution to a retirement mutual fund is deductible in an amount not exceeding 30% of assessable income received that is subject to income tax, with a maximum of THB 500,000 in any tax year. However, if the taxpayer also has any of the contributions noted above under qualified pension life insurance, they must be included in the THB 500,000 limit.
### Super savings fund investment
An investment in a super savings fund is deductible in an amount not exceeding 30% of assessable income received that is subject to income tax, with a maximum of THB 200,000 in any tax year. However, if the taxpayer also has any of the contributions noted above under qualified pension life insurance, they must be included in the THB 500,000 limit.
### Thai environmental, social, and governance (ESG) fund investment
An investment in a Thai ESG fund in an amount not exceeding 30% of the assessable income subject to income tax, with a maximum limit of THB 100,000 in total, can be deducted during the period from 21 November 2023 to 31 December 2032. The investor must hold the units for at least eight years.
However, from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026, there are special conditions for deductions on investments in a Thai ESG fund. Under these conditions, the amount not exceeding 30% of the assessable income subject to income tax, with a maximum limit of THB 300,000 in total (instead of THB 100,000), can be deducted. The investor must hold the units for at least five years instead of eight years.
Until the ministerial regulation of the new conditions is in effect, the prior conditions must be used, which include a maximum limit of THB 100,000 and a holding period of at least eight years. Additionally, from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2032, the deductions will revert to these prior conditions.
### Social Security Fund contribution
The contribution to the government's social security fund is also deductible.
## Personal allowances
There is a personal allowance of THB 60,000 each for the taxpayer and the taxpayer’s spouse (provided that the taxpayer's spouse does not file one's own return). There is also an allowance of THB 30,000 for each child and an additional THB 30,000 for the second child onwards born in or after 2018. Moreover, an allowance for parental care of THB 30,000 per parent is deductible. A non-resident is allowed deductions for spouse, children, and parent only if they are resident in Thailand.
In addition, a deduction is allowed for the care of disabled or incapacitated family members of THB 60,000 per person and for the care of a disabled or an incapacitated person other than a family member of THB 60,000 in total.
## Business deductions
In the case of individuals engaged in business or the practice of a profession, all expenses exclusively incurred for the purpose of the business may be deducted, subject to the various rules prescribed in the Revenue Code. Alternatively, a standard deduction ranging from 10% to 60%, depending on the nature of the business, may be applied.
## Losses
For individuals, the carryforward or carryback of losses is not permitted.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Employment income
Both resident and non-resident individuals who receive assessable income by virtue of hire of service performed in Thailand, including salary, bonuses, gratuities, pensions, the monetary value of rent-free housing, the employer’s payment of income tax, or any other money, property, or benefits derived by virtue of hire of service, are subject to tax in Thailand, regardless of whether the income is paid within or outside Thailand. There are no concessions to foreigners or short-term residents.
## Capital gains
Most types of capital gains are taxable as ordinary income. However, the following capital gains are exempt from tax:
Capital gains and investment income earned by a resident from sources outside Thailand are not taxable unless remitted to Thailand in the year of receipt.
Capital losses may not be offset against capital gains.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from a company incorporated in Thailand are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at a flat rate of 10%. A resident of Thailand receiving dividends from companies incorporated in Thailand may elect to exclude this income from the computation of income tax and waive the tax credit *referred to in the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*.
## Interest income
Interest received from bank deposits, loans to finance companies, debentures, and bills issued by a corporate entity is subject to WHT at a flat rate of 15%. Individuals may choose to exclude interest income from other income, in which case they pay the 15% WHT, or they may choose to include such interest income with other income and pay tax according to the PIT rates, in which case the tax withheld at source is credited against the tax liability.
## Cryptocurrencies and digital tokens
The share of profits or any benefits from holding or possessing digital tokens, or gains from the transfer of cryptocurrencies or digital tokens, are subject to a WHT at a flat rate of 15%.
However, there is an exemption for profit sharing or benefits derived by individuals from holding or possessing investment tokens. The exemption applies to profit sharing or benefits received from 1 January 2024 onwards, provided that the taxpayer does not claim a refund or credit for the tax withheld, which is set at 15%.
## Gifts
PIT is levied on gifts given by persons who are still alive. The tax is collected on the assets or the amount given to parents, ascendants, descendants, spouse, or others based on the value of the gift that exceeds a prescribed threshold, which depends on the type of gift and donor. Assets or amounts given that do not exceed the threshold are exempt from tax.
The following gifts are exempt from PIT:
Gifts in excess of the above thresholds will be subject to PIT at the rate of 5% and will not need to be included together with other income when computing the annual PIT liability.
## Exempt income
Furthermore, provided certain conditions are met, gains or benefits from registered provident funds, retirement mutual funds, long-term equity funds, and national saving funds, including amounts derived from insurance or social security funds, are also tax exempt.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Taxpayers are entitled to credits against their annual tax liability for tax withheld at source.
Persons domiciled and residing in Thailand can elect to take income tax withheld at source from dividends received from companies incorporated in Thailand as a credit against their tax liability. In this case, a credit to take into account the underlying corporate income tax paid on the profit being distributed is added to the dividend income, which is then aggregated with other types of income. Tax at the PIT rates is calculated on the total taxable income and the value of the tax credit is then deducted from the tax so calculated.
