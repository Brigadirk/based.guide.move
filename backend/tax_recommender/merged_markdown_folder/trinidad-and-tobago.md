## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
A Trinidad and Tobago resident corporation is taxed on worldwide income. A non-resident company engaged in business in Trinidad and Tobago is taxed only on income directly or indirectly accruing in or derived from Trinidad and Tobago.
The standard corporation tax rate is 30%, but this varies in the case of certain classes of companies. The current corporation tax rates are as follows:
| Type of company | Corporation tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary companies (excluding banks and petrochemical companies) | 30 |
| Petrochemical companies / companies licensed to carry on banking business | 35 |
| Life insurance companies | 0/15/25/30 |
| Petroleum production companies (petroleum profits tax) | 50 |
| Petroleum production companies (deep sea) | 30 |
| SMEs listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange | 0/15 |
| Special Economic Zones | 15 |
## Business levy
Corporations are subject to a business levy at the rate of 0.6% of gross revenue or receipts where the levy exceeds the corporation tax liability. Exemption is available for certain companies, including petroleum companies and companies whose annual turnover is less than TTD 360,000. The levy is a non-deductible expense for corporation tax purposes.
The business levy rates for small and medium enterprise (SME) companies listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange, within the first ten years from listing on such stock exchange, are broken down and calculated into five-year periods as follows:
Effective 1 January 2024, there is an exemption from business levy on revenue earned by a manufacturer from export sales.
## Green fund levy
A green fund levy of 0.3% on gross income is applicable to companies and partnerships doing business in Trinidad and Tobago. This levy is payable quarterly and is neither a deduction in computing chargeable income nor a credit against corporation tax due.
The green fund levy for SME companies listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange shall be calculated as follows:
## Unemployment levy
Only petroleum companies remain liable to the unemployment levy, at the rate of 5% of taxable profits. No set-off for prior-year losses is permitted in computing the liability.
## Supplementary petroleum tax (SPT)
SPT is chargeable on the gross income (derived from the sale of crude oil) less royalties and overriding royalties paid on the crude oil sold. The tax is computed separately in respect of land and marine operations and is a quarterly tax based on the actual gross income for each quarter.
The SPT is deductible in arriving at profits subject to petroleum profits tax.

## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. Companies are assessed by reference to their accounting period, which for tax purposes cannot exceed 12 months other than in the year of cessation of the business.
## Tax returns
The taxpayer is required to file a tax return with the BIR by 30 April following the end of the fiscal period. An automatic six-month grace period is allowed, following which a penalty is imposed of TTD 1,000 for every six months or part thereof that the return remains unfiled.
## Payment of tax
Corporation tax, business levy, and green fund levy are payable quarterly in advance on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December. Any balance of tax due is payable on or before 30 April of the following year. Instalments of corporation tax are based on an estimate of the current year’s liability or on the actual chargeable profits for the previous year, whichever is greater. If the current year’s estimate is lower, the company may apply to the BIR to reduce its quarterly instalment. The levy liabilities are based on the actual receipts for the quarter.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are conducted by the BIR. There is no specific timeframe to conduct an audit, but, generally, companies are selected for varying reasons, including where large refunds are claimed. The BIR usually notifies the company of the intended audit and requests that the books and records be made available for inspection. An assessment is generally raised after the audit.
## Statute of limitations
A company carrying on business in Trinidad and Tobago is required to keep proper accounts and records and is required to retain these accounts for a period of at least six years after the completion of the transactions, acts, or operations to which they relate or three years after the filing of its return (whichever is later).
The following issues are currently the focus of the tax authorities:

# Trinidad and Tobago
## Overview
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Trinidad and Tobago, with its capital in Port of Spain, gained its independence in 1962. It is one of the most prosperous countries in the Caribbean, largely due to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.
The official language of Trinidad and Tobago is English, and the currency is the Trinidad and Tobago dollar (TTD).
Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment site for international businesses. Growth has been fuelled by investments in liquefied natural gas, petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminium, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning.
Trinidad and Tobago is one of the leading Caribbean producers of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources, but it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and beverages, as well as cement, to the Caribbean region. The country is also a regional financial centre, and tourism is a growing sector, although it is not as important domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Corporate residence is determined by reference to the location of the central management and control of the business of a company.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A non-resident company is subject to corporation tax on its income derived from trading within Trinidad and Tobago. A company is deemed to be engaged in or carrying on trade or business in Trinidad and Tobago if it has an office or place of business or has a branch or agency within Trinidad and Tobago. The local legislation does not make any reference to the term ‘permanent establishment’; however, this term is used generally in the treaty context. Subject to the terms of specific double taxation treaties (DTTs), a non-resident company will have a PE in Trinidad and Tobago where:
The term ‘fixed place of business’ has been generally defined to include a place of management, a branch, office, factory, a workshop, an installation or structure for the exploration of natural resources, or a building, construction, or installation project.
Most treaties outline circumstances under which a company will not be deemed to have a PE, and these include where the activities of the company are merely of a preparatory or auxiliary nature.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Depreciation
Tax depreciation rates (wear-and-tear allowances) have been standardised by statute. Fixed assets are to be classified into one of four classes:
| Asset class | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Class A: Buildings and improvements | 10 |
| Class B: Motor vehicles, furniture and fittings, plant and machinery | 30 |
| Class C: Heavy equipment, motor lorries, trucks, and computer equipment | 33.3 |
| Class D: Extra heavy equipment, airplanes | 40 |
The allowance is calculated at the rate applying to aggregate expenditure incurred on assets within the class on a declining-balance basis.
Accelerated tax depreciation is allowed to manufacturers in the form of an initial allowance at the rate of 90% on capital expenditure on plant and machinery. The allowance is to be claimed in the year that the asset is first brought into use. For those companies engaged in the refining business, production of sugar or petrochemicals, or enjoying concessions under the Fiscal Incentives Act, the rate is 20%.
Gains on the sale of tax-depreciable assets are taxable as ordinary income (i.e. a balancing charge) but only when the written-down value of the assets of a class goes into credit. Prior to this, the proceeds of sale are credited to the particular class, thereby reducing the written down value of the class. Tax depreciation is not required to conform to book depreciation.
### Petroleum operations
A company engaged in the petroleum production business is entitled to capital allowances on tangible costs and intangible drilling and development costs as follows:
There is no timing in respect of claiming of allowances (e.g. on achievement of commercial production). A claim for capital allowances cannot be deferred.
## Goodwill
Goodwill expense is generally not allowable in arriving at chargeable income.
## Start-up expenses
No specific rules exist in respect of start-up expenses, but, generally, these expenses are not deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses incurred by a company in the production of its income are generally allowed as deductions. However, in the case of interest payable or paid by the company, there are certain restrictions that exist in the taxing Acts, as well as in practice by the tax authority, that could restrict a company’s ability to deduct interest paid or payable in its computation of tax for a particular year of income. The criteria laid down by the legislation for the deductibility of interest are:
## Bad debt
A specific provision for bad debt will be deductible for tax purposes where:
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions under deeds of covenant to approved charities are deductible, up to a maximum of 15% of total income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not generally deductible.
## Taxes
Other than SPT, taxes or levies are not generally deductible in arriving at taxable profit.
## Other significant items
Contributions by local insurance companies to 'catastrophe reserve funds' are deductible for tax purposes, up to the value of 20% of net premium income from property insurance business.
## Net operating losses
A trading loss may be carried forward indefinitely to be set-off against future profits. Effective 1 January 2020, the Income Tax Act was amended to restrict the use of the tax losses carried forward by companies engaged in the petroleum production business to 75% of the otherwise chargeable profits.  Loss carrybacks are not permitted.
A limited form of group loss relief exists, whereby current year losses may be surrendered to a claimant company within a group, except that the claimant’s tax liability cannot be reduced by more than 25%. Such companies must be resident in Trinidad and Tobago.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A corporation engaged in business in Trinidad and Tobago may claim a deduction for royalties, interest, and service charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided the appropriate WHT is deducted and properly accounted for. For interest to be deductible for tax purposes, the funds borrowed must have been utilised in the production of income and the recipient must be subject to tax in Trinidad and Tobago or otherwise specifically exempt from local tax.
Deduction for management charges (as this term is defined) paid to a non-resident is restricted to the lower of the management charges or 2% of deductible outgoings and expenses, exclusive of the charges. Tax depreciation allowances may not be treated as an expense for this purpose. WHT may also be applicable to management charges paid to non-resident persons.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
There is no provision for group taxation in Trinidad and Tobago; however, a limited form of group loss relief is available (*see Net operating losses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
## Transfer pricing
There are no specific transfer pricing rules in Trinidad and Tobago. However, the legislation empowers the tax authority to disregard any transactions that it views as artificial or fictitious. This general power has been utilised by the tax authority in dealing with related parties and large multinational companies to evaluate whether transactions are at arm’s length.
It should also be noted that the Minister of Finance recently announced the proposed enactment of Transfer Pricing (TP) laws which is expected to be introduced in 2025 and aligned to the OECD guidelines.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Trinidad and Tobago.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Trinidad and Tobago.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
A branch is subject to Trinidad and Tobago taxation on all income directly or indirectly accruing in or derived from Trinidad and Tobago. The tax rates applicable on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. In addition, branch profits, after deduction of corporation tax and reinvestments, are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 3%. This may be varied by the provisions of any applicable DTTs.

## Personal allowances
A personal allowance of TTD 90,000 is available to resident taxpayers. It is also available to non-residents who are in receipt of pension income accruing or derived from Trinidad and Tobago.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Employment income
A resident individual engaged in employment is assessable to tax on one's worldwide income. A non-resident individual engaged in employment in Trinidad and Tobago is taxed on income received for services performed in Trinidad and Tobago whether or not such income is received in Trinidad and Tobago. For tax purposes, the term 'income' includes all cash and non-cash benefits and allowances derived from employment, including the value of board and lodging provided by the employer.
## Capital gains
Only gains on the disposal of a chargeable asset within 12 months of its acquisition are taxable. Excluded are gains on the disposal of any security in Trinidad and Tobago and gains on motor cars and household goods disposed of for TTD 5,000 or under. Taxable gains are included with other income and are taxed in the normal manner. Capital gains realised outside Trinidad and Tobago by resident aliens are not taxable.
Income arising outside Trinidad and Tobago and received by an individual who is resident but not domiciled in Trinidad and Tobago is taxable in Trinidad and Tobago only to the extent that such income is received in Trinidad and Tobago.
## Dividend income
Dividends, excluding preference dividends, received from investments in resident companies are exempt from tax in the hands of resident individuals. Distributions received from a mutual fund established by a locally licensed trust are also exempt from tax in the hands of a resident individual.
## Interest income
Interest received by a resident individual on all classes of savings or other accounts with banks, financial institutions, or other forms of deposit-taking institutions is exempt from tax.
