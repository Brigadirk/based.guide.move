## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
Rwanda operates both a source and residence-based taxation system. This means that any income that is deemed to be from sources within Rwanda is liable to tax in Rwanda. In addition, resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income. However, where such income is taxed in another country, a tax credit is allowed, which does not exceed the tax that would have been payable on the same income in Rwanda.
Non-resident entities are taxed on income sourced in Rwanda through a permanent establishment (PE).
The standard CIT rate is 28%. However, micro-enterprise companies (with turnover of less than RWF 12 million in a tax period) pay flat tax amounts depending on their turnover amounts, and small businesses (whose turnover is between RWF 12 million and RWF 20 million in a tax period) pay a lump sum tax at the rate of 3% of turnover.
Flat tax amounts payable by micro-enterprise companies are as per the table below:
| Annual turnover (RWF) | Annual flat tax amount (RWF) |
| --- | --- |
| 2 million to 4 million | 60,000 |
| 4 million to 7 million | 120,000 |
| 7 million to 10 million | 210,000 |
| 10 million to 12 million | 300,000 |
Also, road transport activities of persons and goods are imposed a flat amount of tax that is calculated depending on the passenger or goods carrying capacity.
## Special CIT regimes
There are special CIT rates for certain industries or sectors of the economy.
Newly listed companies on capital markets are taxed as follows for a period of five years:
Income accruing from savings in the collective investment schemes or Rwandan employees’ share-based scheme, provided that employees' shares in the company do not exceed 10% of company’s share capital, is exempt.
Agriculturalists and pastoralists are exempt from CIT if turnover from their activities does not exceed RWF 12 million in a tax period.
Deposit-taking micro-finance institutions approved by competent authorities pay CIT at the rate of 0% for a period of five years from the time of their approval.
## Local income taxes
Rwandan legislation does not provide for any provincial or local taxes on income.

# Rwanda
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
Rwanda is a country located within Central and Eastern Africa with a population of approximately 13.2 million people. The capital city is Kigali. At 26,338 square kilometres (10,169 square miles), Rwanda is the world’s 148th largest country. Rwanda is bordered by Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, Burundi to the south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west.
Rwanda is a landlocked country but has many lakes. Mountains dominate the centre and west, while the east consists of savannas, plains, and swamps. The population is young and predominantly rural. The principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, while English and French are also official languages. The currency used is the Rwandan franc (RWF).
Rwanda is a presidential republic based upon a multi-party system. The current President of Rwanda is President Paul Kagame. The Parliament consists of two chambers, and its role is to make legislation. The current constitution divides Rwanda into provinces (*intara*), districts (*uturere*), cities, municipalities, towns, sectors (*imirenge*), and cells (*utugari*), with each subdivision and its borders established by Parliament.
Rwanda’s economy has strengthened over the years and is on a growth path.
Rwanda has a clear vision for growth through private sector investment as set out under Vision 2050. The Vision is expected to transform Rwanda into an upper-middle income nation by 2035 and a high-income country by 2050. To achieve this, the Vision identifies five interwoven pillars, including human development, competitiveness and integration, agriculture for wealth creation, urbanisation and agglomeration, as well as accountable and capable state institutions.
The National Strategy for Transformation (NST1) was developed as an implementation instrument for the remainder of Vision 2020 and for the first four years of Vision 2050. It also integrates far-sighted, long-range global and regional commitments by embracing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the African Union Agenda 2063 and its First 10-Year Implementation Plan 2014-2023, the East African Community (EAC) Vision 2050, the COP 21 Paris Agreement on climate change, and others.
The country provides an investor friendly climate coupled with well-functioning institutions, rule of the law, and zero tolerance for corruption. Rwanda has been cited as one of the fastest reforming countries in World Bank’s *Doing Business* report and was ranked second in Sub-Saharan Africa in *Doing Business 2020*. This was in recognition of radical reforms that the government has implemented in recent years to improve the business environment in the country, including the establishment of the Kigali International Financial Centre (KIFC) in 2020, an investment hub that is currently ranked 5th in Sub-Saharan Africa on the Global Financial Centres Index.
Rwanda is a hub for rapidly integrating East Africa and a member of the EAC with a population of over 312 million people providing a common market and a customs union, where trade is envisaged to flow freely across Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan. In addition, Rwanda is a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) as well as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTFA). Rwanda also assumed leadership of the International Organisation of the Francophone (OIF).
Potential investment opportunities abound, particularly in the following sectors:
There are also opportunities in tourism, especially in the area of conference tourism, and unique assets, such as mountain gorillas. Information and communications technology (ICT), financial services, exports, industrial manufacturing, energy, transport, and construction of low-cost housing are some of the attractive sectors for investment.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied on the supply of taxable goods and services, including online services, in Rwanda as well as on the importation of taxable goods and services into Rwanda.
The threshold for VAT registration is taxable turnover of RWF 20 million in any relevant year or RWF 5 million in a calendar quarter.
The standard VAT rate is 18% and applies to goods and services that are neither exempt from VAT nor zero-rated.
Services supplied are taxable if:
Exports of goods and services are subject to VAT at 0%. Supplies to privileged persons, such as goods imported for official purposes of diplomatic missions, supplies made under special arrangements between the government of Rwanda and donors, and supplies or importation made under special technical aid agreements, are subject to VAT at 0%. Persons entitled to zero rating of goods or supplies received by them are required to pay VAT at the time of receiving the supply and then apply for a refund of the VAT paid or rather engage a revenue authority so they can affix a signature and a stamp on the VAT invoices so that the VAT is not paid on such invoices.
Suppliers who provide zero-rated services or goods are entitled to recover input VAT incurred in making the supply. This is unlike exempt supplies, where input VAT recovery is not allowed. Therefore, zero rating is preferable to exemption.
The VAT returns and relevant payment are due to the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month. However, for taxpayers whose annual turnover is equal to or less than RWF 200 million, the VAT declaration is done quarterly and the payment of the tax due is within 15 days after the end of the quarter. Voluntary VAT declaration on a monthly basis is, however, still admissible for taxpayers in this bracket.
## Customs duties
Rwanda is a member of the East African Community (EAC), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Common External Tariffs (CET) levied by all those economic blocks where Rwanda is part of are generally as follows:
Goods will only enjoy the preferential community tariffs if they meet the EAC Customs Union Rules of Origin.
Certain industries and items are also entitled to exemptions under the customs law (e.g. certain hotel equipment, solar equipment, computer software, and electric vehicles, spare parts, batteries, and charging station equipment).
Enterprises established in Free Trade Zones are exempt from customs duty on imports for exported products. There also exists an import duty remission scheme, where import duty may be waived for raw materials used to manufacture goods for export. This is subject to a requirement for proof of export and execution of the bond.
All imported goods, except those listed as exempt, are also subject to the 1.5% Infrastructure Development Levy (IDL) and the 0.2% African Union Levy (AUL). Additionally, imported goods, regardless of whether they are exempted, are subject to a 0.2% Quality Inspection Fee (QIF). The levies are computed on the customs value of imported goods.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is imposed on the manufacturing or importation of certain commodities, mainly soft drinks, bottled water, cigarettes, alcohol, fuels, and lubricants.
The following rates apply in respect of products and services for which excise duty is applied:
The following goods are exempt from excise duty:
## Immovable property tax
The immovable property tax is assessed and paid by the owner, the usufructuary, or any other person considered to be the owner. The immovable property tax is levied on the market value of a building and surface of a plot of land.
If the immovable property consists of a plot of land that is not built, the tax on immovable property is calculated on each square metre of the whole surface of the plot of land. Where the immovable property consists of a plot of land, a building, and its improvements, the tax on immovable property for a plot of land is calculated separately on each square metre, while the tax on the building and its improvements is based on the market value.
The tax rate on buildings is determined as follows:
The tax rate on plots of land varies between RWF 0 and RWF 80 per square metre. Any undeveloped plot of land is subject to additional tax of 100% of what is arrived at using the rates per square metre.
For the first assessment cycle of five years, declaration of immovable property tax is made to the tax administration not later than 31 December of the first tax period. A new declaration of immovable property tax for the second assessment cycle and going forward will be filed not later than 31 December of the last year of each tax assessment cycle.
## Transfer taxes
The sale of immovable property that is for commercial use results in immovable property tax at the rate of 2% where the seller is a registered taxpayer or at the rate of 2.5% where the seller is an unregistered taxpayer. This tax is on the amount in excess of the first RWF 5 million of the selling price.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp duties in Rwanda.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT is charged on the direct or indirect sale or transfer of shares. The CGT is charged at the rate of 5% of the capital gain. The capital gain on sale or transfer of shares is determined as the difference between the acquisition value of the shares and their selling or transfer price.
CGT is required to be collected and remitted to the revenue authority by the company in which the share sale or share transfer transaction occurred.
CGT is required to be declared and paid within 15 days following the month in which the sale or transfer of shares occurred.
However, the following transactions are exempted from capital gains tax:
Corporate restructuring is defined to include the following:
Note that capital gains arising from the sale of commercial immovable property are subject to tax at the rate of 30%.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to withhold tax on payments to employees in respect of employment services that they have rendered. The tax is withheld through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system. The tax deducted should be remitted to the RRA by the 15th day of the following month.
## Social security contributions
All people working in Rwanda, both nationals and foreigners, are required to contribute to a national social security contribution fund managed by the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB). The rate of contribution under the mandatory pension scheme is fixed at 12% of the employee's gross salary. The employer and the employee are each required to contribute 6% of the employee’s gross salary to the scheme..
Gross salary means total remuneration received by the employee, including allowances, bonuses, commissions, transport allowances and all other cash benefits, as well as any fringe benefits, but excludes reimbursement of business expenses and transport benefit in kind.
The social security contributions computed are required to be remitted to the RRA by the 15th day of the following month.
### Maternity leave benefits scheme
The law governing maternity leave benefits requires all employers and employees to contribute towards a maternity fund, which is administered by the RSSB.
The law grants employed women full monthly salary for the entire 12 weeks duration of maternity leave. The main requirements affecting employers are summarised below:
### Community Based Health Insurance Scheme (CBHIS) contribution
The law governing the CBHIS contributions requires all employees to contribute towards the CBHIS fund, which is administered by the RSSB.
The main requirements are summarised below:
## Trading licence fee
Districts charge a trading licence fee, which is paid by any person who commences a profit-oriented activity in Rwanda. The tax year starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December, and the trading licence fee must be paid for a whole year. If such activity starts after January, the taxpayer must pay a trading licence fee equivalent to the remaining months, including the one in which the activities started.
The tax declaration is made not later than 31 January of the year that corresponds to the tax period. The trading licence fee is calculated on the basis of turnover, and the amount of the fee varies between RWF 100,000 (for turnover of more than RWF 2 million) and RWF 2 million (for turnover of over RWF 50 billion).
The turnover applied is as per the amount approved in the previous year by the RRA. Every year, not later than 31 January, the RRA submits the necessary data to the concerned decentralised entity.
There are also different trading licence fee rates for other small traders. These include profit-oriented activities that are not registered on income tax that are in urban and rural zones, transporters of people and goods on vehicles, boats, and motorcycles.

# Rwanda
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Taxable period
The normal taxable period is between January and December. However, a different tax period can be allowed on approval by the Minister of Finance.
## Tax returns
Companies are assessed with reference to accounting periods. This refers to the period for which a company prepares its accounts. However, an accounting period for CIT purposes cannot exceed 12 months, so companies preparing statutory accounts for longer than 12 months need to prepare more than one CIT return.
Rwanda operates a self-assessment regime. Quarterly tax returns are due on 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December (or by the sixth, ninth, and 12th month of the tax period). The annual tax return/declaration must be filed within three months after the tax period. The tax declaration must include audited financial statements, transfer pricing documentation, and any other documents that may be requested by the tax administration.
## Payment of tax
Advance CIT is payable in three instalments. Tax payments are due on 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December (or by the sixth, ninth, and 12th month of the tax period). Each instalment is arrived at by taking the tax liability as calculated in the tax return/declaration of the previous tax period times current quarter turnover over previous year annual turnover. This amount can be reduced by WHT paid during the tax period. The final payment of CIT for taxpayers with a December year-end is 31 March of the following year. In the case of other accounting year-ends, the final CIT payment is due by the last day of the third month following the accounting year-end.
## Tax audit process
Large taxpayers are selected for audit by the RRA on a regular basis. The RRA tends to audit two tax periods, but this can be extended on request by the taxpayer. Most audits are carried out on site. The RRA may conduct a desk audit of the taxpayer's tax affairs where they note discrepancies on tax returns filed by the taxpayer, anomalies with turnover, or any other situations that justify an audit.
Under normal in-depth audits, the RRA is required to issue a taxpayer with a draft notice of assessment following the completion of the field audit. The draft assessment is referred to as a rectification note. The taxpayer is granted 30 days within which to respond. In case the tax issues are not resolved, a final notice of assessment is issued. The taxpayer is allowed 30 days within which to appeal. Once an appeal is submitted to the Commissioner General, the RRA has 30 days within which to respond to the objection. This can be extended by another 30 days but not beyond this period. At this stage, the appeal is handled by the appeal committee, and the taxpayer and the taxpayer's agent are invited for a meeting to provide explanations.
Once the final assessment is issued, the tax due is payable, although the Commissioner General suspends the collection until the conclusion of the appeal if a taxpayer has paid the undisputed portion of the tax assessed.
There is a provision for resolving the dispute through an amicable settlement process. Taxpayers can opt for this approach while at the same time exploring the next stage of the appeal process.
A taxpayer that disagrees with the response on the final assessment can appeal to the high court within 30 days.
## Statute of limitations
The RRA has powers to audit a taxpayer for a period going back five years, although this can be extended to ten years in case it is established that the taxpayer has concealed information with intent to evade tax. Taxpayers are required to keep their records for a period of ten years.

## Social security contributions
Rwanda has a national social security fund known as the Rwanda Social Security Fund (commonly known as *Caisse Social du Rwanda* or CSR). All salaried workers, both nationals and foreigners, working in Rwanda are required to contribute to the scheme. The employer is required to contribute 5% of the employee's gross salary to the scheme, while the employee's contribution is 3%.
The employer is mandated to deduct social security contributions from employees every month. However, the employer is required to remit total contributions on a quarterly basis, during the month following the end of the quarter. The mandate of collecting social security contributions is with the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA).
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
Capital gains on secondary market transactions on listed securities, as well as employee share option schemes, are exempt from taxation.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
An individual trader is liable for VAT on the same basis as a company. VAT is an indirect tax, which is largely directed at the domestic consumption of goods and services, and at goods imported into Rwanda. The tax is designed to be paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in Rwanda. Goods and services are either exempt from VAT, or are levied at two rates, namely a standard 18% rate and a zero rate.
Most business transactions carried out in Rwanda are subject to VAT. The tax is collected by businesses that are registered for VAT by the RRA on all taxable supplies throughout the production and distribution chain. Sales or supplies by non-VAT registered persons are not subject to VAT.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Rwanda does not levy any net wealth/worth taxes.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Rwanda does not levy any inheritance, estate, or gift taxes.
## Property taxes
## Luxury and excise taxes
Relief from excise duty is available for exported products.
## Transfer taxes

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
Rwandan resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed on their Rwandan-sourced income. The same tax rates are applicable to both residents and non-residents of Rwanda.
However, a resident taxpayer who was not a resident of Rwanda in the five years immediately prior to becoming resident, who works as an expert or a professional directly for an entity carrying out KIFC licensed activities, is exempted from PIT on foreign-sourced income during the first five years following the date of becoming a resident.
The taxable income of a person for any year is the total of that person's income for the year less the total amount of deductions allowed to that person. Taxable income comprises the following: employment income, business profits, and investment income.
## Personal income tax rates
| Bands of income (RWF\*) | | Taxable income (RWF) | **PIT rate (%)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 60,000 | 60,000 | 0 |
| 60,001 | 100,000 | 40,000 | 10 |
| 100,001 | 200,000 | 100,000 | 20 |
| 200,001 | And above |  | 30 |
\* Rwandan francs
## Local income taxes
There are no local income taxes in Rwanda.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
WHT of 15% of the total amount, excluding VAT, is required to be accounted for on payments or other methods of extinguishing an obligation made by resident individuals, including tax-exempt entities. The WHT is due where such payments or other methods of extinguishing an obligation are made to a person not registered with the tax administration or to a registered person who does not have recent income tax declaration.
Payments or other methods of extinguishing an obligation subject to WHT of 15% are related to the following:
However, money that is recorded in the books of accounts as a liability of a taxpayer to creditors and that reduces the taxable income is deemed a payment if it has exceeded six months following the tax period.
WHT is also applicable to non-resident persons for such payments on behalf of their PEs. This means that the local entity/PE is now required to declare and pay WHT at the time when the non-resident pays the foreign supplier on its behalf and not when the non-resident recharges for the costs.
As mentioned above, a WHT of 15% is required to be accounted for on a number of payments. However, the WHT shall be 5% if levied on:
There is also a WHT of 5% that is applicable on goods imported for commercial use. Public institutions are required to retain 3% on payments to winners of public tenders; however, the same is increased to 15% if the winner of the public tender is not registered with the tax administration or when registered does not have their previous income tax declaration. Note that businesses that possess a tax clearance certificate are exempted from deduction of all above WHT.
The ITL is also imposing WHT at the rate of 15% on the difference between winnings of the player and the stake invested by the player of gaming activities. The same has to be withheld by the gaming activities operator.
The WHT deducted should be remitted to the RRA within 15 days following the month of deduction.
## Tax treaties
Rwanda has DTTs with Barbados, Belgium, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jersey, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Morocco, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, and The United Arab Emirates. The WHT rates are as follows:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalty | Management or professional fees |
| Non-treaty | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |  |
| Barbados | 7.5 | 10 | 10 | 15 |
| Belgium | 0/15 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| China, the People's Republic of | 7.5 | 8 | 10 | 10 |
| Congo, Democratic Republic of the | 10 | 10 | 10 | 14 |
| Jersey | 10 | 10 | 10 | 12 |
| Luxembourg | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Mauritius | 10 | 10 | 10 | 12 |
| Morocco | 8 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Qatar | 5/10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Singapore | 7.5 | 10 | 10 | 10 |

| Turkey | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| United Arab Emirates | 7.5 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
The DTTs contain conditions to be complied with for the preferential rates to apply; consequently, it is recommended that professional advice is sought before application.

## Inventory valuation
Trading stock is valued at cost; however, damaged stock is valued at lower of cost price or market price on the last day of the tax period. Work in progress is valued at cost.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividend income includes income from shares in any societies, other similar income that may be generated by all entities that pay CIT, as well as the outstanding balance after the taxation of income from the correction made by the tax administration in the transfer pricing.
Dividend income is subject to withholding tax (WHT) at the flat rate of 15%. Where there is a double taxation treaty (DTT) between the recipient country and Rwanda, a lower rate as per the DTT will apply.
If dividend distribution has been subjected to WHT, this becomes the final tax. Dividends paid between resident companies are exempt to WHT and are not included in taxable income for CIT purposes.
## Financial income
Financial income includes income from loans, debentures, or other debt securities; income from deposits; income from guarantees; and income from government securities, negotiable securities issued by the government, securities issued by companies or other persons, and income from cash negotiable securities.
Financial income is subject to WHT at a flat rate of 15%. Where there is a DTT between the recipient country and Rwanda, a lower rate as per the DTT will apply.
However, the following financial interests are not subject to the 15% WHT:
## Royalty income
Royalty income includes all payments of any kind received or receivable:
Royalty income is subject to WHT at a flat rate of 15%. Where there is a DTT between the recipient country and Rwanda, a lower rate as per the DTT will apply.
## Rental income
Rental income includes all revenue derived from rent of machinery and other equipment, including agriculture and livestock equipment, in Rwanda. This is reduced by 10% of gross revenue as deemed expenses, interest paid on loans, and depreciation expenses.
## Foreign income
Resident companies and enterprises are taxed on their worldwide income. However, a foreign tax credit is granted in respect of taxes paid on the foreign income, subject to the limit of the tax that would have been paid in Rwanda on the same income.
There are no provisions in Rwanda for tax deferral of income earned abroad.

Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Social security contributions
Rwanda has a national social security fund known as the Rwanda Social Security Fund (commonly known as *Caisse Social du Rwanda* or CSR). All salaried workers, both nationals and foreigners, working in Rwanda are required to contribute to the scheme. The employer is required to contribute 5% of the employee's gross salary to the scheme, while the employee's contribution is 3%.
The employer is mandated to deduct social security contributions from employees every month. However, the employer is required to remit total contributions on a quarterly basis, during the month following the end of the quarter. The mandate of collecting social security contributions is with the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA).
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
Capital gains on secondary market transactions on listed securities, as well as employee share option schemes, are exempt from taxation.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
An individual trader is liable for VAT on the same basis as a company. VAT is an indirect tax, which is largely directed at the domestic consumption of goods and services, and at goods imported into Rwanda. The tax is designed to be paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in Rwanda. Goods and services are either exempt from VAT, or are levied at two rates, namely a standard 18% rate and a zero rate.
Most business transactions carried out in Rwanda are subject to VAT. The tax is collected by businesses that are registered for VAT by the RRA on all taxable supplies throughout the production and distribution chain. Sales or supplies by non-VAT registered persons are not subject to VAT.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Rwanda does not levy any net wealth/worth taxes.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Rwanda does not levy any inheritance, estate, or gift taxes.
## Property taxes
## Luxury and excise taxes
Relief from excise duty is available for exported products.
## Transfer taxes

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
Rwanda incorporated companies or associations are treated as Rwanda resident entities. In addition, companies incorporated overseas are also treated as Rwandan resident companies if they have a place of effective management in Rwanda at any time during the tax period. The entity is deemed to have its place of effective management in Rwanda in one of the following circumstances:
Rwandan government companies are also considered to be residents in Rwanda.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE for Rwanda is largely based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention definition. According to Rwandan tax law, a PE means a fixed place of business through which the business of a person is wholly or partially carried on.
For non-resident companies, CIT liability will arise if they have a PE in Rwanda through which a trade is carried on. The profits attributable to the PE will be taxed in Rwanda. However, there are no rules or guidance on how the PE's profit should be evaluated for Rwanda tax purposes. The general understanding is that entities are required to use transfer pricing methods to determine the level of profits that should be attributable to the PE based on the functions it performs.
In particular, the existence of the following triggers a PE:
There are a number of specific exceptions from the definition of a PE. A person is deemed not to have a PE if that person:
A person is considered not to have a PE if they only carry out activities through an independent broker in the capital market, general commissionaire agent, or any other private agent in accordance with procedures of the ordinary course of the activities of such an agent. However, when the activities of the independent broker in the capital market or an agent are carried out wholly or almost wholly on behalf of the person referred above and conditions imposed between the person and the agent in their commercial and financial relations differ from those that would have been made between independent persons, that person is considered to have a PE.
An insurance entity, except in regard to re-insurance, is considered to have a PE if it collects premiums or insures risks through a person other than a broker in the capital market or an agent of an independent status.
A company that controls or is controlled by another company does not, of itself, constitute either company to be a PE of the other.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
A trading company is generally permitted to deduct expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for purposes of the company's trade, provided these costs are not capital in nature and are charged to the profit and loss account.
The Rwandan tax law stipulates that deductible expenses should fulfil the following conditions:
## Depreciation and amortisation
Accounting depreciation of fixed assets is not allowable as a deduction for tax purposes. The same applies in the case of amortisation of assets. However, businesses are allowed specified deductions, referred to as tax depreciation in respect of specified classes of assets. This is deducted in arriving at taxable income.
Tax depreciation allowance is granted to persons who own depreciable assets at the end of the tax period and use such assets in the production of income.
Land, fine arts, antiquities, jewellery, and any other assets that are not subject to wear and tear or obsolescence are not depreciated. Buildings, heavy industrial equipment, and machineries are depreciated annually, each on its own, at a depreciation rate of 5% of the cost of acquisition, construction, refining, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. This is done using a straight-line method.
Intangible assets that are purchased from a third party are depreciated annually, each on its own, at a depreciation rate of 10% of the cost of acquisition or value addition. Information and communication systems whose life is over ten years are depreciated annually at the rate of 10% of the cost of acquisition. Both intangible assets and information and communication systems with over ten years of useful life are depreciated using a straight-line method.
Computers and accessories, as well as information and communication systems whose life is under ten years, are granted tax depreciation at 50% on a reducing-balance method.
Tax depreciation allowance is available on any other business asset at the rate of 25% on a reducing-balance method.
## Goodwill
As mentioned above, intangible assets purchased from third parties (inclusive of goodwill) will attract tax depreciation at the rate of 10%, which is an allowable deduction. However, amortisation of goodwill is not tax deductible.
## Start-up expenses
There is no clear guidance on the tax treatment of start-up expenses. However, in practice, start-up expenses of a capital nature are not deductible for tax purposes. Where they relate to purchase of assets, respective tax depreciation is claimed. Start-up expenses of a revenue nature are tax deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest on borrowed money used for earning business profit or interest in respect of an amount payable for property acquired to earn income is deductible, provided the interest paid is pursuant to a legal obligation and is reasonable under the circumstances.
## Bad debt
A deduction is allowed for bad debt if it fulfils the following conditions:
1. The amount corresponding to the debt was previously included in the income of the taxpayer.
2. Debt is written off in the books of accounts.
3. Taxpayer has taken all possible steps in pursuing payment and has shown a court decision declaring the insolvency of a debtor.
However, for an individual whose debt is less than RWF 3 million, in addition to the conditions referred to in (i) and (ii), the taxpayer must provide proof that one has taken all reasonable steps over a period of three years to recover the debt.
Further, banks, a similar entity, and a leasing entity duly licensed as such are allowed to deduct from taxable income any increase of the mandatory reserve for non-performing loans as required by the directives related to management of loans of the National Bank of Rwanda. Similarly, the business profit is increased by the entire amount recovered from bad debts deducted from such reserves.
## Charitable contributions
Donations and gifts to charitable organisations and other non-profit making organisations are tax deductible to the extent of 1% of turnover. Consequently, donations to profit making organisations, irrespective of the amount, and any donations above 1% of turnover to non-profit making organisations are not allowed as deductions for CIT purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and similar penalties imposed for breaking the law or for statutory offences, such as late payment of taxes, are not tax deductible.
The law does not specify which type of non-statutory fines or penalties are not allowed for tax. For example, there is no guidance on whether fines or penalties paid for breach of contract are deductible or not.
## Taxes
Income tax paid on business profit and recoverable VAT are not deductible for tax purposes. This includes any back taxes paid by the business.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can only be carried forward for five tax periods, earlier losses being deducted before later losses. However, on application, the tax administration may authorise the taxpayer to carry forward the tax loss for more than five tax periods. This is subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.
If the direct or indirect ownership of the share capital or the voting rights of an unlisted company changes more than 25% by value or by number during a tax period, such a company is restricted from carrying forward losses incurred during the tax period and previous tax periods. However, this provision will cease to apply if the change is a result of restructuring that maintains all the shareholders, provided that they have been shareholders for at least three years.
There are no provisions for carrying back tax losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Management, technical, and royalty fees paid to related non-residents are deductible expenses to the extent that:

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
There is no provision for group taxation in Rwanda. Each individual corporate group member is required to submit their own tax return on a stand-alone basis.
## Transfer pricing
Rwandan transfer pricing legislation and the prescribed transfer pricing methods are generally consistent with OECD guidelines. The law requires that transactions between related parties be carried out under the arm's-length principle.
The tax law empowers the Commissioner General to adjust profits earned between related parties if the Commissioner General considers that the trading arrangements between related parties do not adhere to the arm's-length principle. The arm's-length principle requires that transfer prices charged between related parties are equivalent to those that would be charged between independent parties in the same circumstances.
Rwanda operates a self-assessment system; consequently, taxpayers are obligated to self-assess their compliance to the tax legislation, which includes transfer pricing policy. According to the transfer pricing ministerial order, related persons involved in controlled transactions are required to have documents justifying that their prices are applied according to the arm’s-length principle. This means that companies are expected to have transfer pricing policies and documentation. The newly issued Tax Procedures Law (TPL) also requires that documentation be submitted to the revenue authority along with the annual CIT return.
Failure to do so would result in the tax administration’s adjustment of transaction prices in accordance with general rules on transfer pricing issued by an Order of the Minister as well as imposition of penalties and interest.
## Thin capitalisation
The interest paid on loans and advances from related entities is not tax deductible to the extent that the total amount of loans/advances exceeds four times the amount of paid-up equity, which excludes provisions/reserves and retained earnings according to the balance sheet during the tax period. This provision does not apply to commercial banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions in Rwanda for CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
The tax law does not prescribe special provisions for taxation of branches; consequently, tax rates on the profits of PEs are the same as for domestic corporations. PEs are subject to tax at a rate of 28% and treated as domestic companies.
A branch is considered a PE for the parent company; consequently, it is taxed on the income that is sourced from Rwanda only.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
The investment code also provides the following incentives to a registered investor:
There are, however, certain conditions that have to be fulfilled to obtain the incentives above.
## Foreign tax credit
Rwanda allows a foreign tax credit on income generated from business activities performed abroad by a tax resident. The income tax payable is offset by the foreign tax paid on that income. However, the foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of tax that would have been applicable on that income in Rwanda.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Employment income
Employment income includes all payments made to the employee in cash or in kind. This includes the following:
Benefits in kind form part of taxable remuneration. The Rwandan law provides the basis for taxation of the following benefits in kind:
There is no relief for pension contribution as contribution is based on the amount after payment of PIT. The withdrawal is therefore not taxed.
### Equity compensation
There is no specific law on taxation of stock options. In practice, stock options acquired by virtue of employment, whether from the employer or an associated institution, are subject to income tax on the difference between the market value of the equity instrument and the consideration paid by the employee or office holder on the date that the equity instruments vest.
## Business income
Self-employment income is derived from an unincorporated business, partnership, trade, or profession.
An amount received or accrued from self-employment will be taxable in Rwanda. Non-residents will only be taxed on Rwandan-sourced self-employment income.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends declared by Rwandan resident companies are generally subject to a 15% withholding tax (WHT) for individual shareholders, which is the final tax.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to WHT at a rate of 15%, which is the final tax.
## Rental income
Rental income tax is charged on income generated by individuals from a rented immovable property located in Rwanda.
Rental income tax is charged to the following:
The taxable income shall be obtained by deducting from the gross rental income 50%, considered as the expenses incurred by the taxpayer on maintenance and upkeep of the rented property.
When the taxpayer produces the proof of bank interest payments on a loan for the construction or purchase of a rented property, the taxable income is determined by deducting from gross rental income 50%, considered as the expenses incurred plus actual bank interest paid from the beginning of the rental period.
The rental income tax is calculated as follows:
Any person who earns taxable rental income must file a rental income tax declaration not later than 31 January each year.
## Exempt income
The following items are exempt from tax:
## Persons exempted from employment income tax
The following persons are exempted from employment income tax in Rwanda as provided for by international agreements:
