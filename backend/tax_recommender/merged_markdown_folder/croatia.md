## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
CIT is generally paid at a rate of 18 %. For taxpayers with revenues in the tax period lower than EUR 1 million, the rate of 10 % is applied. The CIT payers are domestic enterprises engaged in independent activities on a long-term basis for the purpose of deriving profit, busines units (Pes) of foreign enterprises, and individuals (natural persons) performing a business activity who choose to pay CIT instead of PIT.
The CIT base is the accounting profit adjusted for deductions and disallowed items. Croatian residents pay CIT on profit derived in Croatia and abroad, and non-residents pay CIT only on profits derived in Croatia. The tax base also includes gains arising from liquidation, sale, change of legal form, and division of the taxpayer if it is determined at the market values.
Payments into voluntarily pension funds paid by an employer for an employee under certain conditions prescribed by the CIT Act are also considered as deductible expenditures.
Expenditures are not considered to be deductible expenditures if they are not related to the taxpayer's business activity.
Taxpayers who realise less than EUR 1 million in revenues can determine the tax base according to the cash principle.
The CIT base can be reduced by the following items:
The CIT base can be increased by the following items:
## Local income taxes
There are no significant county or local taxes on income.

Employee's social security contributions are pension contributions levied at the rate of 20 % (15 % first pillar payments, 5 % second pillar payments). The base for their payment is as follows:
Additionally, employers make social contributions for the following social security benefits:
The basis for payment of employer’s social security contributions is gross salary, which is not capped.

## Taxable period
The CIT shall be assessed for a period that is normally a calendar year. The tax administration may agree, at the request of a taxpayer, that the tax period should not correspond with the calendar year, provided the tax period does not exceed 12 months. The chosen tax period cannot be changed for three years.
## Tax returns
All CIT payers are obligated to submit an annual CIT return to the tax administration no later than four months after the end of the tax period for which CIT is assessed.
The Ministry of Finance administers taxation matters through the tax administration. These organisations have responsibilities and powers defined by law.
## Payment of tax
Every taxpayer is required to pay monthly CIT advances (by the end of the month for the previous month) on the basis of the previous year’s tax return.
In the first year of operation, taxpayers are not obligated to pay any CIT advances.
CIT is assessed at the end of the tax period, and the assessed amount, less any instalments made, is payable by the day of submission of the tax return.
## Tax audit process
The Inspection Sector of the Croatian tax administration performs a tax audit of a taxpayer.
The tax audit process is usually performed as follows:
## Statute of limitations
The tax administration’s right to assess tax liabilities and interest; the tax administration's right to collect taxes, interest, and execution costs; and the taxpayer’s right to a refund of tax, interest, and execution costs is subject to a statute of limitations that becomes effective in six years, counted from the day statute of limitations commences, which is 1 January of the year following the year in which the tax return is submitted. However, tax administration may initiate a tax audit only within three years counted from the day statute of limitations commences.
Tax administration is focusing on business relations with related parties. In this regard, the tax administration stipulated the obligation of preparation of a report on transactions with related parties (PD-IPO form) in case the taxpayer recorded transactions with related parties in its business ledgers during the tax period, and to deliver that report along with the CIT return (PD form).
## Binding opinions
Opinions and instructions issued by tax administration central offices are binding for all tax administration regional offices, and the goal is to ensure uniformity of the tax administration representatives’ treatment of taxpayers.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The Croatian VAT system is in line with the provisions of the EU VAT Directive.
VAT is payable on sales of goods and supply of services, import of goods, and intra-Community acquisition of goods.
Croatia has not introduced any VAT grouping rules.
Croatia introduced Central Electronic System of Payment (CESOP) reporting rules as of 1 January 2024.
### VAT rates
The general VAT rate is 25 %.
A reduced rate of 13 % is applicable for:
A reduced rate of 5 % is applicable for:
By way of derogation, VAT is calculated and paid at the reduced rate of 5 % for:
A VAT rate of 0 % is applicable for:
### Reporting obligations
Taxpayers have to electronically file monthly VAT returns by the 20th day of the following month. Exceptionally, taxpayers who do not have any transactions with EU taxpayers (inbound or outbound) and whose aggregate value of goods supplied and services provided in the previous year does not exceed EUR 110,000 can submit the VAT return quarterly.
Any annual adjustments are made in the VAT return for December, which is the last monthly VAT return in a financial year.
In addition, both intra-Community acquisitions and supplies, as well as services provided to or received from an EU-registered taxpayer, have to be reported in a European Commission (EC) Sales and Purchase List, submitted by the 20th day of the month following the reporting month. Nil EC Sales and Purchase List do not have to be submitted.
Where the amount of input tax credits exceeds the entity’s VAT liability, a taxpayer is entitled to a refund of the difference or may choose to use the difference as a VAT prepayment.
The book of incoming invoices has to be submitted electronically by the 20th day of the following month in case the taxpayer received incoming invoices bearing Croatian VAT. Nil book of incoming invoices does not have to be submitted.
### VAT registration
VAT payers are defined as entrepreneurs that supply goods or perform services in Croatia. An ‘entrepreneur’ is any person that continuously and independently performs any economic activity. In addition to those that may be regarded as ‘normal’ taxpayers, domestic enterprises receiving services from foreign enterprises and legal entities and individuals that issue invoices or receipts including VAT without authorisation are also liable to pay VAT.
Companies have to obtain a Croatian VAT ID number in case of EU acquisition of goods in Croatia and EU supplies of goods from Croatia. Export also triggers VAT registration obligation.
Domestic companies performing or receiving services to/from the European Union also have to obtain a VAT ID number.
Foreign companies (not registered for VAT in Croatia) that supply goods within Croatia or perform land-related services in Croatia do not have to register if the recipient is a Croatian company or holds a Croatian VAT ID number, since Croatia has implemented Art. 194 of the VAT Directive.
A domestic taxpayer is required to enter into the VAT system when the value of supplies in the previous or current calendar year exceeded EUR 40,000. Voluntary registration is also possible.
Reclaiming of input VAT is granted to EU-registered VAT payers. No tax representative is required.
Entrepreneurs registered in third countries can apply for a VAT refund, provided reciprocity agreements are in place and a tax representative is used.
In case a foreign company, in general, is registered for VAT purposes in Croatia, it can request a VAT refund via the VAT return.
### Determination of VAT base
The VAT base for the supply of goods and services is the consideration that includes everything that the supplier has received or is supposed to receive from the buyer or a third person in connection to the supply, including the subventions directly related to price of goods and services supplied.
Where no consideration is provided, for instance where goods are exchanged, the VAT base is considered to be the market value of the goods or services. The VAT base of imports is the customs value as prescribed by customs regulations, increased by customs duties, import duties, special taxes, and other fees paid during customs clearing.
### VAT-exempt supplies
VAT-exempt supplies include insurance services; rental of residential property; granting of credits and credit guarantees; transactions related to bank accounts; interest; investment fund management; winnings from special games of chance in casinos, slot machine clubs, and other forms of gambling; supplies of domestic and foreign legal tender, securities, and shares; and supply of land (other than construction land).
Other exemptions, for example, include the following:

# Croatia
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The Croatian PIT system does not allow for joint annual tax return filing.
The annual tax return filing deadline is the end of February of the current year for the previous year.
Obligation to file an annual tax return exists if:
The tax return shows the difference between the annual tax liability and the amount of tax prepayments made during the tax year. Depending on this difference, the taxpayer will be either entitled to a tax refund or will be required to make tax due payment.
The tax burden on income types that are included in the annual tax return can be higher compared to the tax burden indicated at each income category (e.g. other income that falls into the category of annual income).
A special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability arising in connection with employment income and other income that falls into the category of annual income is applicable. The taxpayers are generally not obligated to file their annual tax return. Instead, the tax administration will carry out a special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability.
Taxpayers can realise certain rights that are prescribed by the PIT Act (e.g. the right to increase basic personal allowance based on dependent family members, the right to avoid double taxation) by filing a request for a specific right to be recognised as part of the special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability. The request filing deadline is the end of February of the current year for the previous year.
Income that falls into the category of final income is not included in the annual tax return nor does it fall under the process of annual tax liability assessment. Consequently, tax paid on the final income is deemed finally paid tax (i.e. it cannot be subject to additional taxation regardless of the amount of other types of income taxable at the annual level).
## Payment of tax
Depending on the income type and taxpayer’s circumstances, income tax prepayments can be paid:
Such tax prepayments may constitute final tax (i.e. in case of final income) or a taxpayer may be obligated to file an annual tax return in order for the final annual tax liability to be determined (i.e. in case of annual income) or income enters the process of annual assessment of tax liability (i.e. in case of employment income and other income that falls into the category of annual income). In some cases, a taxpayer can voluntarily initiate the process of annual tax liability assessment in order to realise certain rights.
Based on the filed annual tax return, the tax administration issues a tax assessment. If per such assessment tax due is assessed, the taxpayer has 15 days from the day of tax assessment receipt to cover the tax due. Otherwise, late payment penalty interest is calculated.
Some of the exceptions to the above process are the following:
## Tax audit process
The tax audit process is usually performed as follows:
## Statute of limitations
The tax administration's right to assess tax liabilities and interest; the tax administration's right to collect taxes, interest, and execution costs; and the taxpayer’s right to a refund of tax, interest, and execution costs is subject to a statute of limitations that becomes effective in six years, counted from the day statute of limitation commences. However, the tax administration may initiate the tax audit within three years counted from the day statute of limitation commences, with certain exceptions.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
Croatia, a parliamentary republic in Central Europe that sits along the Adriatic Sea, is bordered by Slovenia to the north, Hungary and Serbia to the east, and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the south. Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb, which is also the capital of Croatia. The official language is Croatian, and the currency is euro (EUR).
Croatia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of World War I. In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal social independent state. Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
On 1 July 2013, Croatia became the 28th European Union (EU) member state. It also became a member of the EU’s borderless Schengen area on 1 January 2023.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
A taxpayer for PIT purposes is every physical person deriving income.
Resident taxpayers are subject to worldwide taxation in Croatia. Non-resident taxpayers are liable to pay tax in Croatia on Croatian-source income. Non-resident performers (artists, entertainers, athletes) are not required to pay PIT if the fee for their performance is paid to a foreign legal entity and subject to WHT in line with CIT legislation.
Under certain circumstances, an individual can, either voluntarily or obligatorily, become a CIT (i.e. profit tax) payer instead of a PIT payer.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
Croatia has progressive tax rates that are applicable to the taxable base in the process of annual tax liability assessment. Progressive tax rates depend on an individual's place of residence or habitual abode in Croatia.
The local self-government units can choose on an annual level two progressive tax rates from a range where 15 % represents the lowest possible rate and 35.4 % represents the highest possible tax rate. However, the actual ranges from which a municipality/city can choose the lower and the higher of the two progressive tax rates depends on the size of the municipality/city:
The local self-government units have until 30 November of the current year at the latest to choose the rates applicable as of 1 January of the following year. The decision in made each year. Those locations for which a local self-government unit does not make a choice by the set deadline are subject to progressive tax rates of 20 % and 30 %.
The following types of income form part of the so-called 'annual income' that is subject to the process of annual tax liability assessment:
Taxable base is calculated by applying prescribed tax deductions and tax allowances (i.e. non-taxable parts of income) to the total amount of annual income.
Tax deductions and tax allowances may, depending on the income type, also be applied when calculating monthly tax prepayments. The following tax rates and tax brackets are used on an annual basis, i.e. in the process of annual tax liability assessment:
| Annual tax brackets (EUR) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 50,400 | 15 to 23.60 |
| 50,400 |  | 25 to 35.40 |
The following types of income form part of the so-called 'final income' that is not subject to the process of annual tax liability assessment:
Consequently, the difference between annual and final income is that the final income does not fall under the process of annual tax liability assessment and the tax paid on the final income is deemed finally paid tax (i.e. final income cannot be subject to additional taxation regardless of the amount of other types of income taxable at the annual level). On the other hand, the annual income is included into the annual tax liability assessment process; consequently, the tax prepayments are not necessarily the final tax payable on that income in the tax year in question.

# Croatia
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## General rules
Interest payments are subject to WHT at a 15 % rate, unless they relate to the following:
WHT on dividends and profit shares is applied at the rate of 10 %. If the company uses a tax allowance for reinvested profit, other than that earned in the banking or the financial non-banking sector, WHT on such dividends and profit shares is not applied.
## EU Directives
The CIT Act provisions and certain EU Directives provide special treatment for dividends, interest, and royalties paid to related companies in Switzerland or states of the European Economic Area (EEA; Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Regarding interest and royalty payments, full exemption only applies to payments between related companies if:
Regarding dividend and profit shares payments, full exemption applies when dividends and shares of profits are distributed to a parent company of Switzerland or an EEA state, provided that:
The recipient of a dividend or profit share is any company:
EU Directives benefits can apply even before the prescribed holding period expires if the taxpayer provides a bank guarantee on the amount of potential WHT liability. If the holding period eventually will not be met, the guarantee will be used to settle the tax liability.
## Treaty rates
If a country has a DTT signed with Croatia, WHT rates are lowered if the treaty rate is lower than the non-treaty rate. There are specific applications that need to be fulfilled in order to benefit from a DTT between countries.
The following countries have a DTT with Croatia:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Other than the above-mentioned countries, Russia is also listed on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions (effective as of 14 February 2023) for tax purposes. However, considering that Russia has a DTT signed with Croatia, all services and fees listed under ‘General rules’ (*see above*) paid to Russian entities are taxable by rates described in ‘Treaty rates’ (*see above*).

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally valued at the lower of their acquisition cost or net realisable value. Taking into consideration the accounting principles set out in the Accounting Act and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Croatian Financial Reporting Standards (CFRS), a company can choose to adopt the most favourable method.
## Capital gains
Capital gains or losses are covered by the CIT regime. They are either an increasing or decreasing item to the CIT base.
## Dividend income
Dividend and profit shares payments made to resident companies are not taxable. Dividends and profit shares paid to non-resident companies are taxed at the WHT rate of 10 %. *Please see the* *Withholding taxes* *section for more information*.
## Interest income
Interest income on loans between related companies has to be determined at the minimum interest rate prescribed by the Ministry of Finance as calculated and published by the Croatian National Bank (the rate is 3.25 % for 2024). An alternative approach (instead of the interest rate prescribed by the Minister of Finance) is that the interest rate can be determined according to the transfer pricing rules, if applied to all contracts.
## Royalty income
## Foreign income
The tax base of a resident taxpayer subject to CIT is the profit earned both in Croatia and abroad, excluding the case where the taxpayer has registered a branch office abroad and taking into account the provisions of respective DTTs.

## Social security contributions
The Croatian social security system covers pension and health insurance.
Social security contributions are payable in respect of realised income or in respect of an artificial basis, depending on the status the individual has in the social security system as well as other relevant circumstances.
In the case of dependently employed individuals, social security charges are borne by the employee and employer.
Employee's social security contributions are pension contributions levied at the rate of 20 % (15 % first pillar payments, 5 % second pillar payments). The base for their payment is as follows:
Additionally, employers make social contributions for the following social security benefits:
The basis for payment of employer’s social security contributions is gross salary, which is not capped.
Employers have certain additional obligations with respect to disabled individuals.
Apart from some exceptions, employers employing 20 and more employees are required to employ a prescribed number of disabled individuals. The number amounts to 3 % of the total number of employees.
Employers that do not comply with prescribed requirements are required to pay a monthly fee amounting to 20 % of minimal gross salary (minimal gross salary for 2024 amounts to EUR 840.00) for each disabled individual that employer was required to employ.
## Consumption taxes

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
Croatia adjusted its legislation to mandatory European Union (EU) Directives (ATAD I and ATAD II) within the CIT Act provisions in relation to exit taxation and hybrid instrument rules.
Croatia also implemented the Council Directive 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements (DAC6) through the Act on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and Rulebook on the automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation.
As of 1 January 2023, Croatia modified its legislation in accordance with Council Directive 2021/514 regarding administrative cooperation in the field of taxation in relation to reporting of digital platforms (DAC7).  As of 1 January 2023, platforms operators have the obligation to report the sale of goods, rental of any mode of transport, provision of personal services, and rental of immovable property to the tax administration.
The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) negotiated within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20, which modifies bilateral tax treaties in order to eliminate double taxation, entered into force in Croatia on 1 June 2021. The Croatian MLI covers 68 double taxation treaties (DTTs).
In December 2022, the United States (US) and Croatia signed a DTT. The new tax treaty will enter into force after both countries have notified each other that they have completed their requisite domestic procedures. Croatia also signed a DTT with Hong Kong in January 2024, but this agreement has not yet entered into force.  New agreements with Andora, Cyprus, and Egypt have been ratified and entered into force.
Croatia has introduced Pillar Two rules into Croatian legislation. According to the Act on minimum Global CIT, the Croatian Pillar Two rules are in line with the Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 of 14 December 2022 on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the Union. The Act entered into force as of 31 December 2023 and applies to the fiscal years commencing after 31 December 2023.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
In terms of the CIT Act, residents are legal or natural persons whose seat is recorded in the Register of Companies or another register in Croatia, or whose place of effective management and control of business is in Croatia. Residents are also entrepreneurs/natural persons with domicile or habitual residence in Croatia whose business activity is recorded in a register or other records.
A non-resident is any person who does not meet one of the requirements referred to above.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a business unit of a non-resident is based on the OECD guidelines, which provides that a non-resident’s business unit is a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources. It also encompasses construction sites or projects that last longer than six months and agents acting on behalf of a non-resident that have the authority to conclude contracts or hold stock of products distributed in the Croatian market in the name of a foreign entrepreneur. The business unit of a non-resident also includes the performance of services (i.e. advisory and business consulting services) for the same or a related project, which lasts for more than three months within a 12-month period.
The PE definition is expanded in line with base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) developments, mainly by introducing anti-fragmentation rules, expanding the definition of a dependant agent, and limiting the exemption scope for preparatory and auxiliary activities.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Depreciation
Most companies depreciate assets on a straight-line basis because depreciation calculated this way, at the prescribed rates, is recognised for tax purposes. Companies are, however, free to use any depreciation method defined in the IFRS or CFRS and to estimate the useful lives of all fixed assets in accordance with their accounting policies.
Prescribed annual depreciation rates are as follows:
| Assets | Depreciation period (years) | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buildings and ships of over 1,000 gross registered tonnage (GRT) | 20 | 5 |
| Basic herd and personal cars | 5 | 20 |
| Intangible assets, equipment, vehicles (except personal cars), and machinery | 4 | 25 |
| Computers, computer hardware and software, mobile telephones, and computer network accessories | 2 | 50 |
| Other non-mentioned assets | 10 | 10 |
However, depreciation expenses that exceed the amount allowed for tax purposes are taxable. The value adjustment expenses of tangible fixed assets are non-deductible if such expenses exceed the amount of expense calculated by using the prescribed depreciation rate.
The cost of depreciation of assets that are not used for business purposes is not deductible.
Plant and equipment are considered to be acquired in the period in which they are installed or ready for use. Plant and equipment include tools of trade, information technology infrastructure (including software), furniture and fittings, and motor vehicles (excluding vehicles for personal use).
If the taxpayer writes off a portion of a depreciable asset, the remaining undepreciated portion will be depreciated at the rate prescribed by law. According to the CIT Act, the taxpayer can double the depreciation rates.
Land and forests (renewable resources) are not depreciated.
Financial assets, cultural monuments, and artwork are not depreciated, either.
Depreciation of vessels, aircraft, condominiums, and vacation houses can be tax deductible only if certain conditions are met.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is usually the difference between the consideration paid and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets. If the taxpayer applies CFRS for its financial reporting, then goodwill must be amortised over five years.
The amortisation of goodwill is not recognised for tax purposes.
If the taxpayer applies IFRS for its financial reporting, any goodwill impairment is considered as a non-deductible expense for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Generally, start-up expenses are considered to be expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred. As no special rule is provided for tax purposes, they are considered as tax deductible expenses for CIT purposes in the year in which they are incurred.
## Interest expenses
According to the CIT Act, late payment interest is tax deductible, unless it is due to related companies, regardless of whether the late payment interests are charged by resident or non-resident related parties.
Interest expenses on loans between related companies is also deductible, up to the amount prescribed by the Ministry of Finance as calculated and published by the Croatian National Bank (3.25 % for 2024) and if compliant with thin capitalisation rules (4:1 ratio). An alternative approach is to determine the interest rate according to the transfer pricing rules, if applied consistently to all contracts.
The ATAD interest limitation rule limits the deductibility of interest to 30 % of taxpayer's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), or to an amount of EUR 3 million, whichever is higher. Interest that cannot be deducted in the current tax year may be carried forward for a period of three years.
## Bad debt
Value adjustments arising from the adjustment of the value of claims against customers for goods delivered and services rendered are recognised as deductible expenses if more than 60 days elapsed between the maturity of the claim and the end of the tax period, and if the claims were not collected up to 15 days before filing the CIT return. The claim needs to be recorded in the business books as revenue, and all measures for debt collection (legal actions) have to be taken in accordance with best management practices.
These expenses are permanently deductible if a settlement has been reached with the debtor CIT payer who is not a related person, in case of bankruptcy, arbitration, or conciliation, based on a special regulation.
In addition, the law introduces a possibility of permanent tax deductibility of expenses from write-offs of receivables recognised from an unrelated person. It applies if a taxpayer proves that costs of initiating a procedure to collect the receivable are higher than the amount of the receivable itself. It also applies if it proves that it took the necessary actions with due care and diligence of a prudent businessperson with the aim of collecting the receivable, whereby one determined the final inability to collect the amount of the receivable being written off.
Receivable write-offs made in accordance with a special regulation on the procedure of extraordinary administration in companies of systemic importance are tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Charitable contributions
Donations in a form of gifts in kind or cash for cultural, scientific, educational, health, humanitarian, sports, religious, environmental, or other socially beneficial purposes to bodies of state administration, local and regional governments, and other persons according to special regulations are tax deductible by 2 % of the revenues generated in Croatia in the previous or current year. Exceptionally, the amount may exceed 2 % of the revenues generated in the previous or current year, provided that it is granted pursuant to the decisions of competent ministries with the consent of the government on the financing of special programs and activities.
The donations of food to prescribed persons for social, humanitarian, and other purposes, and to people affected by natural disasters, can also be considered as tax deductible (provided the donations are in line with the relevant regulations of the Ministry of Agriculture, as well as that the food is donated with the aim of protecting the environment and preventing the loss of large quantities of food).
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties prescribed by Croatian administrative and judicial authorities are non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward and utilised within five years following the year in which the losses were incurred and must be utilised in the order in which they occurred. The losses may not be transferred to any third party except in the case of merger, de-merger, or acquisition. Tax losses cannot be carried back.
Utilisation of tax losses from previous years in case of statutory changes of legal entities is prescribed in detail in the CIT Act, limiting the entitlement where the legal predecessor is inactive and in case of a significant change in business activity or ownership structure.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The treatment of payments made to foreign affiliates is dealt with through the mechanism of the CIT base adjustments. The CIT base is increased for any concealed profit payments made. The tax administration may audit the expenditure of non-resident taxpayers, examining expenditure on goods and services abroad as well as management, IP, and other fees and payments that may have the character of a profit transfer. If the tax administration discovers that transactions have been used to conceal profit transfers, the difference between the declared price/fee and the average market price/fee will be added back into the taxpayer’s tax base.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
There are no group taxation provisions in Croatia.
## Transfer pricing
Prices between a Croatian entity and its foreign related parties must be set at fair market value (the arm’s-length principle). Provisions on transfer pricing are also introduced in transactions between domestic related parties if one of the parties has:
If the prices between related entities are different than those between non-related entities, the tax base must be calculated with prices that would have been charged between unrelated companies. In order to analyse and determine the market value of the related party’s transaction and to confirm their arm's-length nature, the following methods can be used:
### Advance pricing agreements (APAs)
Taxpayers have an option of concluding an APA with the tax administration and administrative bodies of other states where related entities involved in transactions with domestic taxpayers are residing is available. The APA determines certain criteria (e.g. methods, comparables, adjustments, key assumptions) applicable to future transactions in order to determine transfer prices for such transactions during a certain period.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Croatia harmonised its legislation with Action 13 of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) plan by introducing CbC reporting requirements. These provisions are implemented in the Act on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation and the Rulebook on Automatic Exchange of Information in the Field of Taxation. Taxpayers (members of multinational enterprises whose global consolidated turnover exceeded EUR 750 million in previous year) are required to submit to the tax administration the following reports and information:
Local companies/branches that are not ultimate parents are obligated to notify the tax administration:
This is done through CbC report notification, which also includes information on the taxpayer responsible for submission of the CbC report (either the ultimate parent or surrogate parent), its identity, and its tax residence.
CbC report notification is submitted electronically to the tax administration together with the annual CIT return, and the deadline to file CbC report notification is the same as for a CIT return (i.e. four months upon the financial year-end). After first submission of the CbC report notification, annual re-submission is not required. Instead, CbC report notification is submitted only in case of change of any information submitted in the CbC report notification that was previously submitted.
### Public CbC reporting
Amendments to the Accounting Act in July 2023 introduce the provisions of Council Directive (EU) 2013/34/EU concerning the obligation to file reports on profit tax (public CbC reporting). The Directive aims to enhance corporate tax transparency and the accessibility of income tax information to the public by jurisdiction.
The Accounting Act introduces the obligation to report on income tax information for the financial year commencing on or after 1 January 2024. The report shall be submitted no later than 12 months after the end of the respective year, and the obligation applies to:
The reporting obligation for medium-sized and large entities and branches does not apply if the ultimate parent or a standalone entity has prepared a report on income tax information that has been published and made accessible to the public free of charge in an electronic reporting format that is machine-readable on the website of that ultimate parent or of that standalone entity in at least one of the official languages of the European Union and if the report identifies the name and the registered office of the subsidiary or the branch governed by the law of the Republic of Croatia or another member state.
The reporting obligation does not apply to financial institutions since they are subject to separate reporting requirements.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest on loans from a shareholder or a member of a company holding at least 25 % of shares or voting power of the taxpayer will not be recognised for tax purposes in relation to the amount of the loan that exceeds four times the amount of the shareholder’s share in the capital or their voting power. Interest on loans obtained from financial institutions is exempt from this provision. Loans from a shareholder or a member of a company are considered to include:
## Interest rate charged between related parties
The Croatian CIT Act and CIT Rulebook stipulate specific rules for the deductibility of interest expenses charged by related parties, as well as income charged to related parties for the purposes of CIT. Accordingly, regardless of the actual market interest rate, tax-deductible interest expense and tax-deductible interest income in the tax period shall be determined by applying the provisions of Article 14 of the CIT Act and Article 37 of the CIT Rulebook.
According to the aforementioned Article of the Act, market interest rate (i.e. the market interest rate for taxation) shall be determined and published by the Minister of Finance before the beginning of the taxation period to which it will apply, taking into consideration that this is an interest rate realised in comparable circumstances or that would have been realised between unrelated parties. The Minister of Finance establishes this market interest rate as the arithmetic mean of the interest rate of the European Central Bank on the main refinancing operations, which was published by the Croatian National Bank in the current calendar year. Accordingly, the Minister stipulated an interest rate of 3.25 % for 2024.
Besides the market interest rate prescribed by the Minister of Finance, taxpayers can opt to determine the interest rate between related parties in a way stipulated for determining the fees agreed between unrelated parties in general (i.e. in accordance with the arm’s-length principle), under the condition that the same modality of determining interest applies to all financial agreements that taxpayer has with related parties.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC rule is applied in Croatia. A CFC is any subject located in another country whose income is not subject to taxation in that county if:

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
The Act on Investment Promotion provides the following reliefs and incentives for taxpayers.
## Investment promotion incentives
Incentive measures for investment projects in the Republic of Croatia are regulated by the Act on Investment Promotion and pertain to investment projects in:
Incentive measures can be used by enterprises registered in the Republic of Croatia investing in fixed assets the minimum amount of:
The amount of aid shall be calculated as a percentage of investment value, which is determined on the basis of eligible investment costs. Eligible investment costs are:
The larger of these two amounts constitutes the baseline for calculating the amount of aid.
The percentage of investment value used for calculating the aid amount is 50 % for large, medium, small, and micro enterprises.
The minimum period for maintaining the investment and newly created jobs linked to an investment is five years for large enterprises, and three years for small and medium-sized enterprises, but no less than the period of use of the incentive measures.
The following incentive measures are available:
## Tax incentives
Tax incentives decrease the CIT rate, depending on the amount of the investment and the number of new jobs created.
Tax incentives for micro entrepreneurs require a minimum investment of EUR 50,000 and allow tax incentives in the form of a 50 % decrease of the tax rate over a period of five years, with a minimum of creating three new jobs. Tax incentives for small, medium, and large entrepreneurs over a period of ten years from the start of investment can be obtained under the following conditions:
| Investment amount (EUR) | Number of newly employed persons | CIT rate reduction (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 150,000 to 1,000,000 (from 50,000 for ICT system and software development centres) | 5 (10 for ICT system and software development centres) | 50 |
| 1,000,000 to 3,000,000 | 10 | 75 |
| More than 3,000,000 | 15 | 100 |
## Employment incentives
Employment subsidies are incentives for creating new jobs in relation to the investment project. Non-refundable subsidy for eligible costs of new jobs created depends on the unemployment rate in the county in which the investment is located. The incentive rate is applied to eligible costs of jobs creation.
| County unemployment rate | Incentive rate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 10 % | 10 % (maximum EUR 3,000 per employee) |
| 10 % to 15 % | 20 % (maximum EUR 6,000 per employee) |
| More than 15 % | 30 % (maximum EUR 9,000 per employee) |
The specified amount of the grant refers to employment of persons that are the long-term unemployed, regardless of length of service and level of education, who are registered as unemployed with Croatian Employment Service that are either unemployed for at least six months, older than 50 years, or persons without work experience. The grant also applies to persons whose contract was cancelled because of the bankruptcy proceedings.
For other categories of workers, the incentive rate is 40 % of the amount presented in the table above.
## Incentives for education and training
The non-refundable subsidy shall not exceed 50 % of the eligible costs. It may be increased, up to a maximum aid intensity of 70 % of the eligible costs, as follows:
For investment in development and innovation activities, a non-refundable grant shall be approved for the purchase of plant/machinery amounting to 20 % of the actual eligible costs for purchasing plant/machinery, in the maximum amount of EUR 500,000, provided that the purchased plant/machinery represents high technology equipment. For such investments, additional grants (of up to 50 % of amounts prescribed by this Act) are available for opening new workplaces related to the investment project.
## Incentives for the capital expenses of investment projects
An incentive can be granted for an investment project if the minimum investment in fixed assets is EUR 5 million and 50 new jobs are created within a three-year period from the start of the project.
Those projects can benefit from additional non-refundable subsidies between 10 % and 20 % of the eligible costs of investments for:
The percentage of non-refundable subsidies depends on the unemployment rate of the county where the investment is located.
The non-refundable subsidies could be up to EUR 1 million, depending on the applied percentage of the eligible costs, with the condition that the part of investment in the machines/equipment equals at least 40 % of the investment and that at least 50 % of those machines/equipment are of high technology.
## Incentives for labour intensive investment projects
Labour intensive investment projects in fixed assets are those with at least 100 new jobs created within a three-year period from the start of the project.
Initial employment incentives can be increased by an additional 25 % for up to 300 new jobs, 50 % for a minimum of 300 new jobs, and up to 100 % for a minimum of 500 new jobs.
## Incentives for investment projects through economic activation of inactive property owned by Croatia
An incentive is available for free lease of inactive property for up to ten years from the start of investment.
The requirement for this incentive is an invested amount of at least EUR 3 million in the fixed assets and 15 new jobs created within a three-year period from the start of the project.
In addition, the investor has to achieve a 50 % increase in the value of the inactive property within three years in relation to the estimated value of the inactive property at the time of starting the lease.
## Incentives for modernisation of business processes
Incentives for modernisation of business processes are related to automation, robotisation, and digitalisation of processes in the manufacturing and processing industry.
An investment project for which the incentive for modernisation can be granted implies investment in fixed assets in the minimal amount of EUR 500,000 together with preservation of an initial number of employees through the whole period of investment utilisation.
The CIT rate will be reduced 50 % for investments amounting from EUR 500,000 to EUR 1 million, 75 % for investments amounting from EUR 1 million to EUR 3 million, and 100 % for investments amounting to more than EUR 3 million for a period of ten years counting from the year when the investment started.
The level of productivity per employee must be increased at least 10 % after the expiration of the three-year period of investment project realisation in relation to productivity per employee one year prior to the application of the investment project.
## Foreign tax credit
If a domestic taxpayer has paid tax abroad on profit derived abroad, the tax paid can be included in its CIT return, up to the CIT rate in Croatia. The amount of paid tax abroad, which can be offset with the domestic tax, is calculated in the following way:
In practice, it means that if the amount of tax paid abroad was charged at a rate equal to or lower than 10 %/18 %, only the actual amount of foreign tax paid can be offset with the domestic tax.

## US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In 2015, the US Treasury and Croatia signed and released an intergovernmental agreement (IGA), while the FATCA Agreement entered into force on 27 December 2016.

### Social security agreements
As of Croatia's accession to the European Union (EU) on 1 July 2013, Croatia coordinates its social security system with the social security systems of all EU member states (and with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland).
Croatia coordinates its social security system with the United Kingdom (UK). For this purpose, as of 1 January 2021, Croatia applies the rules from the Protocol on Social Security Coordination, which forms part of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.
Concerning non-EU member states, Croatia has bilateral social security agreements with the following countries:

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Employment income (annual income)
Employment income includes all remuneration such as salaries and other payments in cash or in kind and pensions paid on the basis of the employment relationship.
Employers may give employees certain benefits that qualify as non-taxable. The following are the most common:
If any of these benefits exceed the prescribed limits, the difference is considered to be salary and is subject to PIT and employer’s and employee’s social security contributions.
The taxable base for employment income is equal to total remuneration less expenditures (i.e. employee’s social security contributions) and applicable personal allowances (*see the*[*Deductions*](deductions.html) *section*).
| Monthly tax brackets (EUR) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 4,200 | 15 to 23.60 |
| 4,200 |  | 25 to 35.40 |
Generally, tax calculation, withholding, and prepayments’ obligations, as well as all reporting obligations arising in respect to the realised income, lie with the income payer. However, there are cases (e.g. when income is realised directly from abroad) when this general rule is not applicable.
## Self-employment income (annual income)
Taxable self-employment income includes income from:
Individuals realising self-employment activity are obligated to keep business books and evidences.
The taxable base for self-employment income is equal to business receipts less tax allowable business expenditures and applicable personal allowances (*see the [Deductions](deductions.html)* *section*). Note that the relevant regulation specifically prescribes what is to be regarded as business receipts and business expenditures.
Taxpayers who earn self-employment income make monthly tax prepayments in accordance with annual tax returns that they are required to file after the year-end.
A tax loss may be determined in respect of self-employment activities as well as other activities for which income is determined on the basis of business books. It can only be deducted from the income on the basis of which it has been determined. Tax loss can be carried forward for up to five successive years.
Derogations from the described tax compliance process are possible in case of a taxpayer realising self-employment activity who is not subject to VAT pursuant to the VAT Act and whose annual receipts from this activity do not exceed the amount prescribed by the VAT Act for the mandatory registration in the VAT system (EUR 40,000). The tax will be paid as a lump sum on the basis of the Tax Administration's assessment. Such taxpayer is not obligated to file an annual tax return in respect of this income.
Self-employed individuals are subject to social security contributions in accordance with special rules.
## Other income (annual income)
There are two categories of other income: (i) annual other income and (ii) final other income.
Annual other income is considered to be realised on the basis of the following:
The taxable base for other income is equal to income less expenditures. Additional expenditures shall be recognised in the amount of 30 % of the income acquired on the basis of:
Tax levied on other income is withheld by a payer of income at the lower tax rate (ranging between 15 % and 23.60 %, depending on the individual's place of residence or habitual abode in Croatia) without provision for taxpayers to claim personal allowances.
Note that a taxpayer realising other income may, upon request, determine one’s income in the manner prescribed for self-employment activities.
## Income from property and property rights (final income)
Taxable income from property and property rights includes income from the following:
Income from property and property rights is generally not subject to social security contributions. In specific circumstances, individuals realising income from property and property rights may be subject to social security contributions in accordance with special rules (e.g. if the income realised on this basis is taxed as self-employment income).
### Rentals and leases
The taxable base for income from property on the basis of rental or lease of movables and immovables can be decreased by 30 % for expenditures (lump-sum deduction). Tax payments are made according to the assessment issued by the Tax Administration.
The tax rate is 12 %, and no personal allowance is allowed.
### Property rights
The taxable base for income from property rights can be decreased by the amount of expenditures actually incurred, for which the taxpayer has proper and credible documentation. The expenditures are recognised based on a report that the taxpayer needs to file with the Tax Administration within 15 days as of year-end of the year for which the report is filed. The taxpayer needs to pay tax liability within 15 days of receiving the assessment. The tax rate is 24 %, and no personal allowance is allowed.
### Disposal of property and property rights
The taxable base for income from disposal of property and property rights can be decreased by the procurement value (increased by a rise in producer prices of industrial products) and disposal costs. Tax payments are made according to the assessment issued by the Tax Administration. The tax rate is 24 %, and no personal allowance is allowed.
### Disposal of waste
The taxable base for income from disposal of waste can be decreased in accordance with specific regulations. Tax payments are withheld by the income payer. The tax rate is 12 %, and no personal allowance is allowed.
## Income from capital (final income)
Income from capital includes the following:
The taxable base depends on the type of income from capital. No personal allowance is allowed when calculating tax prepayments at the rates stated below.
Tax calculation, withholding, and prepayments’ obligations, as well as all reporting obligations arising in respect to the capital income, lie with the income payer (unless income is realised directly from abroad) except for capital gains income.
The tax rates applicable to the taxable base are the following:
Capital losses can be deducted only from capital gains realised in the same tax year. Capital losses in relation to the disposal of financial assets that would, in case disposal resulted in capital gains, be exempt from taxation cannot be offset against the capital gains.
When it comes to capital gains income, obligation of keeping records, determining income from capital gains, tax calculation, tax prepayments, and reporting obligations lie with the financial assets holder, who may arrange it with the company/individual/Central Depository & Clearing Company Inc. to take over all obligations except for tax payment obligation. In case of capital gains realised on the basis of disposal of participation in capital of limited liability companies, a taxpayer is obligated to report the disposal to the Tax Administration and shall be obligated to pay tax on the basis of the tax assessment issued by the Tax Administration.
Income from capital is not subject to social security contributions.
## Other income (final income)
As already mentioned, there are two categories of other income: (i) annual other income and (ii) final other income.
Final other income is:
No personal allowance is allowed.
Note that this type of other income is determined by the Tax Administration (with the exception of income in relation to temporary and occasional seasonal work in agriculture and income on the basis of gratuity).
Final other income (with the exception of income in relation to temporary and occasional seasonal work in agriculture and income on the basis of gratuity) is not subject to social security contributions.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
For the purpose of taxation, the PIT Act distinguishes between resident and non-resident taxpayers.
Taxpayers are deemed resident taxpayers where they:
Individuals who do not have real estate in their ownership or at their disposal nor are physically present for at least 183 days in one or two calendar years in Croatia are regarded as non-resident taxpayers.
If a taxpayer has real estate in one’s ownership or at one’s disposal in Croatia and abroad, one is considered a resident taxpayer in the country in which one's family resides; or if one has no family or place of one’s residence cannot be determined, one is deemed a resident taxpayer in the country from which one usually goes to work to or in which one is predominantly physically present. In case the other country does not consider such an individual as its resident taxpayer, one is deemed a Croatian resident taxpayer.
Where appropriate, provisions of the applicable Double Tax Treaty (DTT) are consulted for determining one's tax residence status for DTT purposes.
