# Isle of Man
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
The general rules for the calculation of taxable income are the same whether a company is liable to tax at 0%, 10%, 20%, or a combination of these rates.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value. Any method of valuation that accords with sound commercial principles is acceptable for tax purposes, provided it is adopted consistently at the beginning and end of the accounting period and does not conflict with tax law. In practice, inventories are normally valued for tax purposes at the lower of cost or net realisable value. A first in first out (FIFO) basis of determining cost where items cannot be identified is acceptable, but not the base stock method or the last in first out (LIFO) method.
In general, the book and tax methods of inventory valuation must conform.
## Capital gains
There is no capital gains tax in the Isle of Man.
## Dividend income
Dividends are taxed at the standard rate of 0%. Dividends received from Isle of Man companies do not suffer withholding tax (WHT).
## Banking income
Licensed banks are taxed at 10% on income from deposit taking, any related activities, and interest earned from the investment of regulatory reserves only.
Income earned on capital and reserves in excess of the regulatory capital, group funded lending, fiduciary deposits, assurance, insurance, custody, trust, and corporate services is not classified as banking business and is taxed at the 0% rate.
General expenses are allocated against 0% and 10% income streams on a *pro rata* basis.
The 20% rate applies to income earned by banks from real estate situated in the Isle of Man.
## Royalty income
Royalties are taxed at the standard rate of 0%.
## Rental income
Companies with profits arising on rental income in respect of land or property situated in the Isle of Man are charged to income tax at a rate of 20%. This rate applies whether or not the company is resident in the Isle of Man.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are liable to tax on their worldwide income (albeit the relevant rate of tax is often 0%).

# Isle of Man
## Overview
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency, located in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the 13th century, when it was ceded to Scotland, the Isle of Man came under the British crown in 1765. Though the Isle of Man is a British Crown Dependency, it is not part of the United Kingdom (UK) or the European Union (EU). However, the United Kingdom remains constitutionally responsible for its defence and international representation. The Isle of Man is divided into 16 local authorities, with Douglas as the capital. The official language of the Isle of Man is English.
The Isle of Man is in currency union with the United Kingdom, and the Manx pound is a local issue of coins and banknotes denominated in pounds sterling. An official separate currency code for the Manx pound does not exist; but where a distinct code is desired, IMP (Isle of Man pound) is generally used.
Offshore banking, insurance, fiduciary services, e-gaming, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the Isle of Man's economy.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Individuals who are resident in the Isle of Man are liable to tax on their worldwide income from all sources.
A non-resident is liable to tax on any source of income arising or accruing in the Island, with the exception, under extra statutory concession, of bank and building society interest and dividends.
## Personal income tax rates
A standard rate of 10% is charged on taxable income of resident individuals on up to 6,500 Isle of Man pounds (IMP) for single persons and IMP 13,000 for jointly assessed couples.
A higher rate of 22% is charged on taxable income exceeding the standard rate limits.
The personal allowance for 2024/25 is IMP 14,500 IMP for single persons and IMP 29,000 for jointly assessed couples, which is reduced by IMP 1 for every IMP 2 that income is in excess of IMP 100,000 for single persons or IMP 200,000 for jointly assessed couples (*see the [Deductions](isle-of-man/individual/deductions.html) section*).
Subject to an irrevocable election, there is a tax cap of IMP 200,000 (or IMP 400,000 for a married couple) on an individual Isle of Man resident’s income tax liability for the five years commencing 6 April 2020.
Non-residents pay tax at a rate of 22% on total taxable income.
## Withholding taxes (WHTs)
The Assessor of Taxes in the Isle of Man has the power to require the deduction of WHT, at a rate determined by the Assessor (typically 20%), on payments of taxable income made to a non-resident individual (e.g. payments made to a non-resident sub-contractor).
## Local income taxes
There are no other taxes on income.

# Isle of Man
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Taxable period
An accounting period for tax filing purposes can be no more than 12 months.
## Tax returns
All companies are required to submit income tax returns on an accounting-period basis, whether they are liable to tax at 0%, 10%, 20%, or a combination of these rates. The tax return is due for submission one year and one day following the end of an accounting period. Where the financial statements cover more than 12 months, two (or more) returns may be required.
Companies are required to file their income tax returns online.
Fixed rate penalties apply if returns are filed late. The Assessor of Income Tax also has the powers to raise a default assessment where a tax return has not been filed.
## Payment of tax
Payment of tax is due within one year and one day of an accounting period end. Interest is charged on tax paid late.
## Tax audit process
There is no formal regular tax audit process in the Isle of Man. The Assessor of Income Tax can make an enquiry into a return within the time limits set out below.
## Statute of limitations
Generally, the Assessor of Income Tax may make an enquiry into a tax return no later than 12 months from the date that the tax return is delivered to the Assessor.
If, however, the Assessor discovers that income tax has not been assessed that should have been assessed, the Assessor is able to make an assessment of that tax within a period of four years from the end of the relevant accounting period.
The Assessor also has powers to require the production of documents.
The Isle of Man is focused on reducing the avoidance of income tax and national insurance contributions of individuals using personal service companies and has introduced legislation to tackle this issue.
There is also more focus on the taxation of dividends paid to shareholders, particularly in relation to whether a payment is a *bona fide* dividend or disguised remuneration.
In order to comply with commitments made to the European Union, from 1 January 2019, a 'substance' requirement for companies resident in the Isle of Man for tax purposes was introduced. The legislation is targeted at companies that derive income from 'relevant sectors' as defined in the legislation but which do not have any real economic activity and presence in the Isle of Man.

VAT is a transaction-based tax applied on the domestic supply of most goods and services and is currently charged at a standard rate of 20%.

Some supplies are charged at 0%, including food, books and publications, and public transport, and there is also a 5% rate applied to domestic property repairs, amongst other things. Finally, some supplies are exempt from VAT, including insurance and financial services, betting and gaming, education, and healthcare.
## Customs and excise duties
In addition to VAT, the Isle of Man forms a common jurisdiction for customs and excise duties with the United Kingdom, and, again, the rules are broadly identical.

## Payroll taxes
Employers in the Isle of Man are responsible for deducting tax from an employee’s remuneration under the Income Tax Instalment Payments (ITIP) scheme. An employer is any person, which includes any individual, company, partnership, or public body, that engages or hires the services of someone and, in return, pays a wage or fixed payment.
The scheme covers everyone who receives remuneration and includes employees, office holders (e.g. directors), and pensioners. Any remuneration is subject to ITIP, and tax should be deducted in accordance with the individual’s tax code.
For the purposes of ITIP, ‘remuneration’ means any payment of salary, wages, fees, commission, pensions, or annuities and some termination payments.
## National Insurance contributions
In addition to deducting ‘National Insurance’ contributions from their employees’ earnings, employers in the Isle of Man are required to make a ‘secondary’ National Insurance contribution in respect of each of their employees, depending on the individual’s circumstances.
The standard rate of secondary contribution is 12.8% on earnings over IMP 145 per week.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
A company incorporated in the Isle of Man is automatically resident for tax purposes and must therefore file an annual income tax return, whether it pays tax at 0%, 10%, 20%, or a combination of these rates.
A company that is incorporated elsewhere will be considered resident in the Isle of Man if it is 'managed and controlled' in the Isle of Man, and it will be taxed on its worldwide income accordingly. 'Managed and controlled' is generally interpreted as being the place where the board of directors meets, although this is not always conclusive.
In cases where a company is resident in a country with which the Isle of Man has a tax treaty, then a tie-breaker may operate to determine residence.
Note that a company that is incorporated in the Isle of Man will not be resident if it can prove to the satisfaction of the Assessor that:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A place of business includes a PE, such as a branch office or shop, factory, workshop, or mine. The definition of a PE is not set out in statute, and, in cases where the company is resident in a country with which the Isle of Man has a DTA, the terms of the agreement will determine the company’s residence.
## Substance test
For accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019, legislation is in place to ensure that corporate entities satisfy a 'substance test' in the Isle of Man. The legislation is targeted at those companies in the Island that receive income from certain 'relevant activities' identified by the European Union (EU) but that do not have any real economic activity and substantial economic presence in the Island.
All companies with activities and income in a 'relevant sector' in an accounting period will be required to demonstrate that they have adequate substance in the Island.
Relevant sectors are defined as follows:
To satisfy the adequate substance requirements, a company must demonstrate that it:
If a company in a relevant sector does not meet the economic substance requirement in an accounting period, it will be subject to sanctions, including financial penalties, which will be levied in respect of each period in which the company fails to meet the requirements. The level of financial penalty will increase in cases of repeated periods of failure, and the company may ultimately become subject to a winding up order.

# Isle of Man
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Relief is given in calculating the taxable profit of a company if the expense is incurred in the normal course of the business and is incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes. However, certain expenses that are deducted in the computation of profits are not allowable for tax purposes. These include depreciation, unpaid but accrued pension and bonus payments, certain lease payments, and customer entertainment costs.
## Depreciation
Depreciation charged in accounts in not allowable for tax purposes. Instead, relief for depreciation is given using 'capital allowances' based on a reducing-balance method. Plant and machinery, tourist premises, industrial buildings, commercial buildings within a designated area, fish processing buildings, and agricultural buildings and works have an initial allowance of 100%. There are restrictions on allowances for expensive motorcars.
Isle of Man government grants are not taken into account in determining the amount of expenditure on which allowances may be given.
Tax depreciation is not required to conform to book depreciation.
Upon disposal, allowances will be reclaimed on the sale proceeds, restricted to cost.
## Goodwill
No relief is given against trading profits for the purchase of goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses incurred in the three years prior to the commencement of trading, which would have been deductible as a trading expense if incurred after the commencement of trading, are treated as a loss arising in the year trading commenced, and relief for these losses can be claimed, subject to the normal loss-relief rules.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to lenders subject to Isle of Man tax is allowable in full. Interest paid to lenders not subject to Isle of Man taxation is allowable if it is incurred in the normal course of the business and is wholly and exclusively for business purposes. Only interest charged at a reasonable commercial rate will be allowed as a deduction.
## Bad debt
Relief against trading profits is only available in respect of specific bad debts. General provisions are not allowable.
## Charitable contributions
Broadly, trading companies are able to claim a deduction for donations made to charities, subject to a maximum of IMP 15,000 or 1% of their taxable income, whichever is greater.
## Fines and penalties
No relief is available for any payments made in respect of fines or penalties, whether related to income tax compliance or otherwise.
## Taxes
## Net operating losses
Losses can be carried forward indefinitely against future profits from the same trade.
Trading losses incurred may be carried back against preceding year profits. There are additional rules that apply in the opening years of trade. Terminal losses in the last year of trade can be carried back against profits for the previous three years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There is no formal transfer pricing regime in the Isle of Man, and payments made to foreign affiliates, such as royalties, management charges, and service fees, are deductible under normal principles. If, however, the Assessor of Income Tax is of the opinion that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of any transaction is the avoidance or reduction of tax liability, assessments may be made to counteract that avoidance or reduction.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Trading losses and excess capital allowances may be surrendered (subject to certain restrictions) between 75% affiliates resident in the Isle of Man. Similar concessions are available to members of a consortium, but only a fraction of the loss or excess may be set-off, that fraction being equal to the members’ share in the consortium in the relevant year of assessment.
## Transfer pricing
There is no formal transfer pricing regime in the Isle of Man. If, however, the Assessor of Income Tax is of the opinion that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of any transaction is the avoidance or reduction of tax liability, assessments may be made to counteract that avoidance or reduction of tax liability.
## Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR)
The Isle of Man has implemented legislation to enact CbCR. CbCR is one of four minimum standards under the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project that aims to improve transparency between multinational businesses and tax authorities, and to help identify aggressive tax avoidance. The Isle of Man CbCR Regulations set out matters including the definition of certain terms, filing and notification obligations, and the format for CbCR.
Under CbCR, multinational enterprise groups (MNE groups) with consolidated group revenue of 750 million euros (EUR) or more are required to report specified data on their international operations to their tax authority annually. That tax authority will in turn automatically exchange CbCR information to jurisdictions in which the MNE group operates and has an appropriate international agreement to exchange such information. In the Isle of Man, the first reporting fiscal year was that beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
Where there is no CbCR reporting obligation, there is a requirement to notify the Assessor of Income Tax of the name of the entity that is undertaking the reporting and to provide certain other information. This information is required as part of the company's Isle of Man income tax return.
## Thin capitalisation
There is no specific thin capitalisation rule in the Isle of Man.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no CFC regime in the Isle of Man.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Deductions are available to individuals only for the actual expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in acquiring the income on which income tax is payable. This might include professional subscriptions and travel expenses where an individual is employed and other costs incurred in the normal course of business where the individual is self-employed.
For employees, the expense of travelling to and from work is not deductible.
Self-employed individuals may also be eligible to claim relief for certain capital expenditure incurred as outlined in the *[Deductions](../corporate/deductions.html) section in the Corporate tax summary*.
## Personal deductions
Deductible non-business expenses include the following:
The maximum amount of interest for which relief can be claimed is IMP 5,000 *per annum*. This amount is doubled in the case of a married couple or civil partners who have chosen to be jointly assessed, but the relief is restricted to 10%.
## Standard deductions
There are no standard or flat rate deductions.
## Personal allowances
Allowances for residents for 2024/25 (year commencing on 6 April 2024) are as follows:
| Allowance | IMP |
| --- | --- |
| Single person | 14,500 |
| Married couple or civil partners (combined allowance; totally transferable if election made for joint taxation) | 29,000 |
| Single parent addition/Co-habiting couple addition | 6,400\* |
| Age allowance (for over 65 years) | nil |
| Blind person/Disabled person | 2,900\* |
\* Available in addition to a single person allowance.
Personal allowances are only available for offset against income of the tax year in question and cannot be carried back or forward.
A personal tax credit is available under certain circumstances to Isle of Man's resident individuals who are aged 65 or over or who are registered disabled or blind, and whose income has not reached the level of the single person allowance.
Non-residents are not entitled to a personal allowance; all of their taxable income will be taxed at the prevailing higher rate (22% for 2024/25).
The personal allowance is reduced by IMP 1 for every IMP 2 that income is in excess of IMP 100,000 for single persons or IMP 200,000 for a jointly assessed couples.
## Losses
Trading losses incurred by self-employed individuals can be relieved against total income assessable in the year of the loss and/or carried forward and set against total income assessable in the following year.
Loss relief can be restricted where trades are carried out on a non-commercial basis or where the trade is of farming or market gardening.

## Partnerships

## Key employees
Legislation was introduced with effect from 6 April 2020 that replaced an extra statutory concession relating to special treatment of key employees.
The special treatment is aimed at individuals who are or will be new residents and who are essential to the implementation and the operation of new business in the Island.
Subject to fulfilling certain conditions, for the first three years after becoming resident for tax purposes, the income of the individual will be treated as if they were not resident in the Island.
