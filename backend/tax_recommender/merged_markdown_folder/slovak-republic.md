# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The tax base is generally the accounting result as determined under Slovak statutory accounting rules, adjusted for tax purposes.
## Inventory valuation
Stock (i.e. inventory) is valuated at cost. Slovak legislation specifically provides for the use of the arithmetical average cost and first in first out (FIFO) methods to value stock. Last in first out (LIFO) may not be used. The tax treatment follows the accounting treatment.
## Capital gains
Capital gains from the disposal of assets are included in the CIT base. The tax treatment of capital losses depends on the type of asset on which they arose.
Capital gains on the alienation of shares and participation interest in Slovak companies may be taxed in Slovakia, predominately if sold to a buyer who is a Slovak tax resident or has a PE to which the purchase is attributable.
The income from the sale of shares or participation interest of a company where the value of immovable property is more than 50% of the equity has its source in Slovakia.
However, as of 1 January 2018, income from the sale of shares in joint-stock companies, ownership interests in limited liability companies, or limited partnerships (hereafter ‘participation’) may be exempt from CIT if certain conditions are met. These conditions include the possession of at least 10% of shares or ownership interests for at least 24 months (counting from 1 January 2018 at the earliest).
A taxpayer who performs substantial functions in Slovakia, bears and manages the risks associated with the participation ownership, and has adequate personnel resources and material equipment to perform these functions may apply the tax exemption. However, the tax exemption does not apply to taxpayers who trade in securities, to the sale of companies in liquidation, bankruptcy, or restructuring, or to taxpayers in liquidation.
## Exit tax
The exit tax applies to income in situations where taxpayers (Slovak tax residents and non-residents with a PE in Slovakia) transfer outside of Slovakia:
The tax is calculated by applying a 21% tax rate to a specific positive tax base, which is determined as follows:
The exit tax must either be paid in one instalment in the period for filing the tax return or, upon request, in five annual instalments if it is a transfer to an EU or European Economic Area (EEA) member state. When paying the tax in instalments, the taxpayer must also pay interest on outstanding instalments.
The regulation on the exit tax also addresses the valuation of assets and liabilities for Slovak tax purposes where a Slovak tax non-resident becomes a tax resident in Slovakia.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid to legal entities from the profits generated after 1 January 2004 are not subject to Slovak income tax, except for dividends:
Dividends paid to entities from profits generated until 31 December 2003 and:
## Interest and royalty income
Slovak-source interest income earned by taxpayers with limited, as well as unlimited, tax liability is subject to withholding at a flat tax rate of 19% (for states without a DTT / from non-cooperative jurisdictions, *please refer to the**Withholding taxes**section*), except where the recipient of the deposit interest or the yield is a Slovak investment fund, Slovak supplementary pension fund, Slovak bank or the branch of a foreign bank, or the Slovak Export-Import Bank.
Slovak-source royalty income of tax non-residents is subject to the 19% corporate flat tax rate (for states without a DTT / from non-cooperative jurisdictions, *please refer to the**Withholding taxes**section*).
Interest and royalty income is exempt if it is paid by a Slovak payer to a recipient who is a tax resident in the European Union and is a beneficial owner of this income, provided that for 24 months before the payment:
## Unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses
## Foreign income
Companies resident in the Slovak Republic are taxed on their worldwide income, including income of its foreign branches. A Slovak tax resident entity is able to deduct from its tax base a tax loss made by its taxable PE (e.g. branch) outside the Slovak Republic, adjusted for Slovak tax purposes.
Credit relief is available for foreign tax paid under most of Slovakia’s DTTs. Alternatively, exemption of foreign income taxed abroad from taxation in Slovakia may apply.
Slovakia does not have provisions related to deferral.
## Reverse-hybrid mismatches
In relation to the implementation of Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries (ATAD 2), a provision concerning the taxation of a reverse-hybrid entity has been added to the ITA.
The purpose is to prevent non-taxation of income (revenues) achieved by 'transparent companies' (e.g. a general and a limited partnership) domiciled in the Slovak Republic where the partner of such a company is a person or entity from the state who considers the Slovak company to be a taxable entity, i.e. the income is neither taxed as being that of a Slovak company nor as being that of a foreign partner.
This means that the income (revenue) of Slovak transparent entities attributable to its foreign shareholders with at least 50% of the share capital, voting rights, or profit of this company may be taxed, provided certain conditions are met, as being that of a Slovak company. The provision will not, however, apply to a collective investment vehicle that is widely held and is subject to investor-protection regulation in the Slovak Republic.
The provision became effective as of 1 January 2022 and applied for the first time in the tax period beginning from 1 January 2022.

# Slovak Republic
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The Slovak Republic (Slovakia) is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east, and Hungary to the south. Its capital is Bratislava. The official language of the Slovak Republic is Slovak, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Slovakia joined both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in the spring of 2004 and the Euro area on 1 January 2009. Slovakia has made significant economic reforms since its separation from the Czech Republic in 1993. Reforms to the taxation, healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems have helped Slovakia to consolidate its budget.
The 3Q 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) grew year-on-year by 1.2%. As of September 2024, the unemployment rate reported by the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic is 5.41%.
Reducing cost and managing risk is fundamental to shareholder value. We assist in the process by advising on all corporate and local business tax issues. This includes advice on structuring investments in the Slovak Republic and on claiming inward investment incentives. We perform tax due diligence, transfer-pricing reviews, and internal tax reviews. We can also advise on restructuring companies, including pre-exit and post-acquisition transformations.

# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Mainly, the following payments are subject to WHT when made by Slovak companies to foreign parties. Dividends are also subject to tax, effective as of 1 January 2017 (subject to specific rules - if paid to private individuals). However, a DTT may reduce or eliminate the rate.
| Payments | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Fees for services | 19/35 |
| Royalties \* | 19/35 |
| Interest on loans and deposits \* | 19/35 |
| Dividends \*\* | 7/10/19/35 |
\* Royalties and interest paid to related EU-resident companies are not subject to WHT if certain conditions are met.
A 35% WHT rate applies on payments to taxpayers from non-cooperative jurisdictions (i.e. where no DTT or TIEA exists, the taxpayer is from a jurisdiction that is listed in the EU's List of Non-Cooperating Countries or a state that does not apply CIT, or a zero CIT rate applies) or where the beneficial owners of the income cannot be identified.
WHT should be paid to the Tax Office no later than 15 days from the end of the calendar month following that in which the payment was made. The withholding obligation lies with the Slovak resident taxpayer. The taxpayer must also notify the tax administrator of the tax withheld and transferred. If the tax is not properly withheld, the unpaid tax becomes the Slovak tax resident’s tax liability, and a penalty may be assessed.
This table highlights countries with which Slovakia has entered into a DTT.

As of 1 January 2018, employee’s social security contributions total 9.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 1,478.62 per month in 2025.
The employee’s health insurance contributions total 4% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total remuneration of the employee.
Employer’s social security contributions total 24.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 3,838.12per month in 2025, plus they pay injury insurance contributions of 0.8% of employees' total salary costs per month, which are not capped.
The employer’s health insurance contributions total 11% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total employee’s remuneration.
The regular monthly contributions to the health insurance system are treated as advance payments for the yearly liability and are subject to an annual reconciliation of health insurance contributions. Reconciliations are performed by a health insurance company.
Note that non-cash benefits and income from the sale of shares are subject to health insurance contributions. Dividend income received from profits arising from 2012 until 2016 is subject to health insurance contributions at a rate of 14%, up to 60-times the average monthly salary from two years prior (i.e. EUR 51,480). The recent amendment of the Income Tax Act (ITA) abolishes the 14% statutory health insurance contribution from dividends received from profits arising from 1 January 2017 or later years.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
As a member state of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Slovak Republic’s (Slovakia's) system of corporate taxation generally follows OECD guidelines and principles.
The corporate income tax (CIT) applies to the profits generated by all companies, including branches of foreign companies.
Slovak tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income. Slovak tax residents may utilise a method of elimination of double taxation if their income is taxed abroad. The exemption or credit method can be used to eliminate the double taxation, depending on the relevant double tax treaty (DTT) and the type of income.
Slovak tax non-residents are taxable in Slovakia on their Slovak-source income only. Slovak-source income is defined by local tax law and includes, *inter alia*, the business income of permanent establishments (PEs) and passive types of income, such as royalties, interest, and income from disposal of assets.
The standard CIT rate for 2024 was 21%. The reduced CIT rate for 2024 at 15% is applicable for corporate taxpayers and entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals that achieve taxable income (revenues) up to 60,000 euros (EUR) (previously 49,790 EUR) for the relevant tax period.
From 1 January 2025 the following CIT rates applies to the taxpayers-legal entities:
Legal entities whose taxable income in the tax period exceeds EUR 5,000,000 will pay income tax at an increased tax rate of 24%.
Also legal entities are required to pay a minimum CIT, regardless of actual results. Annual minimum required CIT amount are prescribed as follows:
Entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, who achieve taxable income (revenues) up to 100,000 euros (EUR) (previously 60,000 euros (EUR)) will keep the 15% tax rate for 2025.
A 10% WHT rate, which applies to certain taxable dividend payments to individuals from 1 January 2025 reduced to the previously applicable 7% WHT rate.
Further, some income, such as interest or royalties, may be subject to a 19% WHT rate. A specific 35% WHT rate applies for payments to taxpayers from non-cooperative jurisdictions (i.e. where no DTT or tax information exchange agreement [TIEA] exists, the taxpayer is from a jurisdiction that is listed in the EU's List of Non-Cooperating Countries or a state that does not apply CIT, or a zero CIT rate applies) or where the beneficial owners of the income cannot be identified, including payments of taxable dividends.
## Local income taxes
Slovakia does not have local, state, or provincial CIT.

# Slovak Republic
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year corresponds to the calendar year for individuals.
## Tax returns
If annual taxable income exceeds half of 21 times the minimum subsistence amount announced on 1 January each year (i.e. EUR 2,876.90 for 2025), a tax return must be filed by 31 March following the calendar year-end, unless all of the taxpayer's taxable income has been taxed through a Slovak payroll or through WHT, and, in the case of payroll, the individual has obtained a year-end tax reconciliation from one's employer.
A taxpayer can extend the deadline for filing and payment of the tax return. The deadline can be extended up to three months upon notification and up to six months if the individual has income from foreign sources.
Husbands and wives must file separate income tax returns.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld monthly at source from employment income for employees of a Slovak company or branch, for most employees of a foreign company assigned to work in a Slovak branch or PE of that foreign company, as well as for most employees assigned to work in a Slovak company.
Individuals who are Slovak tax residents or Slovak tax non-residents who intend to be present in Slovakia for more than 183 days and receive employment income from abroad for work carried out in Slovakia must calculate and pay monthly tax advances on this income if this income is not being taxed through a Slovak payroll.
For non-employment income that is not liable to Slovak WHT, individuals are responsible for making advance tax payments on the basis of their previous year's tax liability.
## Electronic communication obligations
As of 1 July 2018, all entrepreneurs and their representatives are obligated to deliver all communication with the Financial Administration electronically only.

# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Taxable period
The standard fiscal year is a calendar year, but a Slovak entity may opt to change this to a different 12-month period.
## Tax returns
A corporate tax return must be filed together with the entity’s financial statements within three months following the fiscal year-end. The taxpayer may extend the filing deadline by up to three months or six months (in case foreign income is included in the tax return). To extend the filing deadline, the taxpayer must notify the Tax Office before the normal filing deadline. After notification, the deadline is automatically extended.
## Payment of tax
The balance of tax due for a fiscal year is payable by the filing deadline.
Advance payments of corporate tax must be paid monthly or quarterly during the current tax period. Instalments are usually based on the last known tax liability of the entity. It is not necessary to pay tax advances if the last tax liability did not exceed EUR 2,500.
As of 1 January 2020, companies are required to pay tax advances only if their last tax liability exceeds EUR 5,000.
Starting from 1 January 2022, the tax administrator will notify a taxpayer who submitted a tax return of the amount and the due date for payment of the income tax advance no later than five days before its due date.
As of 1 January 2022, the tax reliability index is introduced, which represents the evaluation of a taxpayer regarding their ability to fulfil certain tax responsibilities towards the tax administrator. The taxpayer considered as reliable shall have specific tax benefits.
### Penalties
The penalties levied by the Tax Office will depend on the time elapsed from the deadline for filing the regular tax return to the date of filing the amended tax return or the start of the tax audit. As the interest rate of the European Bank is changed from 18 December 2024, the tax penalties are changed accordingly:
The penalties will be levied at a minimum of 1% of the assessed amount and a maximum of 100% of the assessed amount.
An ‘aggregated penalty’ applies for cases of more than one administrative offence.
## Electronic communication obligations
As of 1 January 2018, all legal entities registered in the Commercial Register are required to deliver submissions to the Financial Administration electronically only.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the tax authority selects the taxpayers subject to tax audit based on certain criteria that are not communicated to the public.
The taxpayers that utilise state aid in the form of tax relief are subject to specific tax audit in the year of utilisation of the tax relief.
The tax audit has to be finalised within one year.
## Statute of limitations
A tax may not normally be assessed or additionally assessed more than five years (ten years when DTT treaty was applied, including transactions with foreign-related parties) after the end of the year during which the obligation to file a tax return arose, or during which the taxpayer was obligated to pay the tax. If a tax inspection is undertaken within this five-year period, another five-year period commences from the end of the year in which the taxpayer was notified of this action.
However, tax may be assessed, or additionally assessed, no later than ten years after the end of the year during which the obligation to file a tax return arose, or during which the taxpayer was obligated to pay the tax.
The tax authorities, within a tax inspection, generally focus on transfer pricing, VAT, limited tax deductibility of special types of costs (e.g. entertainment, promotion costs), and tax incentives.

## Social security contributions
As of 1 January 2018, employee’s social security contributions total 9.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 1,478.62 per month in 2025.
The employee’s health insurance contributions total 4% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total remuneration of the employee.
Employer’s social security contributions total 24.4% of remuneration; however, due to caps on the amounts on which these contributions are levied, the total contribution does not exceed EUR 3,838.12per month in 2025, plus they pay injury insurance contributions of 0.8% of employees' total salary costs per month, which are not capped.
The employer’s health insurance contributions total 11% of remuneration; however, as of 1 January 2017, caps on amounts on which these contributions are levied were abolished and the health insurance contributions are levied from the total employee’s remuneration.
The regular monthly contributions to the health insurance system are treated as advance payments for the yearly liability and are subject to an annual reconciliation of health insurance contributions. Reconciliations are performed by a health insurance company.
Note that non-cash benefits and income from the sale of shares are subject to health insurance contributions. Dividend income received from profits arising from 2012 until 2016 is subject to health insurance contributions at a rate of 14%, up to 60-times the average monthly salary from two years prior (i.e. EUR 51,480). The recent amendment of the Income Tax Act (ITA) abolishes the 14% statutory health insurance contribution from dividends received from profits arising from 1 January 2017 or later years.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
From 1 January 2025 a basic VAT rate of 23% (previously 20%) applies to all taxable supplies, with certain exceptions. From January 1, 2025, two reduced tax rates of 19% (instead of 10%) and 5% apply (this reduced rate does not change). At the same time, the list of goods and services to which reduced rates are applied is changing.
A general overview of the application of reduced rates is provided below:
|  | **Current rate** | **New rate** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic food | 10% | 5% |
| Other food | 20% | 19% |
| Electric energy | 20% | 19% |
| Medicines | 10% | 5% |
| Electronic books | 20% | 5% |
| Medical devices | 10% | 5% |
| Accommodation services | 10% | 5% |
| Restaurant services - food | 10% | 5% |
| Restaurant services - non-alcoholic beverages | 10% | 19% |
| Restaurant services - alcoholic beverages | 20% | 23% |
| Fitness centre - entrance fees | 10% | 5% |
| Ski lifts, entrance fees to sports facilities and swimming pools | 10% | 23% |
| Entrance fees to sports events | 20% | 5% |
| Social enterprises | 10% | 5% |
| Rental apartments | 5% | 5% |
From 1 January 2025 taxable persons established in Slovakia will become VAT payers if their annual turnover exceeds the threshold of EUR 50,000 in the current  calendar year. The VAT registration is generally effective from the next calendar year, however if the annual turnover exceeds the threshold of EUR 62,500 the VAT registration is effective immediately. Voluntary registration is also possible. Upon VAT registration, all bank accounts used for business purposes related to Slovak VAT registration have to be announced to the Tax Office.
More taxable persons established in Slovakia (i.e. with a seat, place of business, or VAT establishment in Slovakia) can create a VAT group if certain conditions are met.
From 1 January 2025, foreign taxable persons (no seat or VAT establishment in Slovakia) will no longer be obliged to apply for VAT registration before commencing activities subject to Slovak VAT, but they will become a Slovak VAT-payer upon supply of the goods/services subject to the Slovak VAT (with some exemptions); receipt of the prepayment for the the goods/services subject to the Slovak VAT; receipt of the goods in Slovakia from other EU member state under certain conditions. Notification obligation will be introduced.
There is a list of supplies that foreign taxable persons can perform in Slovakia without a need to register for Slovak VAT, including mainly:
This list, among others, includes local supplies of goods and specific services to taxable persons established in Slovakia as such supplies are subject to local VAT reverse-charge mechanism (i.e. person liable to pay VAT on such supplies is the customer).
Foreign taxable persons registered for Slovak VAT are not entitled to deduct input VAT via Slovak VAT return if such input VAT relates only to supplies subject to VAT reverse-charge. Foreign companies can claim Slovak input VAT via the VAT refund procedure, provided they meet the stipulated conditions. If the foreign VAT payer that is entitled to a full VAT refund via a specific EU VAT refund application acquires goods in Slovakia from EU countries, its acquisition of goods in Slovakia from another member state is considered as VAT exempt.
Exempt supplies without credit entitlement include, among others, certain postal services, financial and insurance services, education, public radio and TV broadcasting services, health and social services, the transfer and leasing of real estate (with exceptions), and lottery services. There are also exempt taxable supplies with credit entitlement, for example financial and insurance services provided to the customer established outside of the European Union, supply of goods to other EU member states, certain import of goods, and export of goods and services.
A special regime for payment of VAT by a supplier based on receipt of payment for supplied goods or services (‘cash accounting’) is available in Slovakia in very specific cases. This regime postpones the obligation to pay VAT until the customer pays the supplier for the supply. This cash accounting scheme can only be used by Slovak-established entities (i.e. with a seat, place of business, or fixed establishment in Slovakia) provided they meet certain conditions.
Supplies of certain types of goods and services between two Slovak VAT payers are subject to local reverse-charge. Such supplies, among others, include supplies of real estate, metal waste and scrap metal, agricultural crops, iron and steel, mobile phones and integrated circuit devices, etc. Local reverse-charge also applies to supply of construction works, supply of building or parts of buildings under construction, and some supplies of goods with assembly and installation. For such supplies, the supplier will not charge VAT on the issued invoice and the recipient must apply a reverse-charge.
Under specific conditions, VAT payers (creditors) can decrease the tax base and VAT if customers (debtors) fail to pay fully or partially for domestic supplies and the receivable becomes irrecoverable.
Additionally, from 1 January 2025 the definition of the supply of goods related to leasing contracts, where the terms provide for the transfer of ownership of the leased goods to the lessee at the end of the lease period, is changed. The interpretation in line with the decision of the Court of Justice of EU C-164/16 Mercedes Benz will apply on contracts concluded after 31 December 2024. Based on the introduced amendments transfer of assets under the financial lease contracts could fall under the supply of goods (rather than under the supply of services), causing the immediate VAT liabilities arise from the total value of the asset in the period of the transfer.
## Customs duties
To communicate with the customs offices, each person must have an Economic Operator Registration and Identification Number (EORI), which is registered by the customs authorities on request. EORI registration is mandatory for customs clearance.
The European customs nomenclature and customs tariffs are set by EU legislation. Customs procedures are harmonised within the European Union.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is charged on the release to tax-free circulation or import of tobacco products, wine, spirits, beer, mineral oil, electricity, coal, and natural gas. The excise tax rate depends on the customs classification of the product.
The excise duty administrator is the Customs Authority. Communication with the Customs Authority must be in electronic form if the company is a VAT payer registered in Slovakia or if it is represented by a tax adviser or attorney.
## Immovable property tax
Immovable property tax, which is divided into land tax, building tax, and tax on apartments, is governed by the Act on Local Taxes. Immovable property tax is calculated based on the area of the real estate, its location, and its type, as well as the tax rate of each self-governing region.
The immovable property tax rate may vary significantly. Please find below the spread of the tax charges per square metre.
| Property | Immovable property tax per square metre (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Four floor office building in center of city of Bratislava | 13.15\* |
| One floor hall rural area, approx. | 0.89 to 9.00 |
\* For each additional floor, add an additional tax of EUR 0.33.
Further, municipalities may opt to impose a local development levy that applies to real estate developments. If a municipality decides to impose the levy, its rate may be between EUR 3 and EUR 35 per square metre.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in the Slovak Republic.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp duties or similar taxes on share or other property transfers in the Slovak Republic, although small administrative fees are payable to register such transactions.
## Turnover taxes
There are no turnover taxes in the Slovak Republic.
## Payroll taxes
Taxable remuneration from employment includes all remuneration, whether monetary or non-monetary, including in-kind benefits provided to an employee. Statutory health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employee reduce taxable income. Obligatory employer’s health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employer are not part of the employee’s taxable income.
Employers must keep Slovak payroll records for employees and members of their statutory bodies.
The tax base up to EUR 48 441,43 €is taxed at 19%. The exceeding part of the tax base is taxed at 25%.
A tax rate of 7% or 35% applies to taxable dividend income (e.g. dividends from profits generated from 1 January 2017) of individuals starting from 1 January 2017. The higher tax rate applies in case of dividends received from non-treaty jurisdictions.
A tax rate of 10% applies to taxable dividend income from profits generated from 1 January 2024 – 31 December 2024. From 1 January 2025 a tax rate of 7% applies to taxable dividend income from profits generated from 1 January 2025.
Income of constitutional authorities from dependent activity is, in addition to the tax calculated as listed above, subject to a special tax rate of 5%.
## Social security contributions
Employer’s health insurance and social security contributions total 36.2% of employee remuneration. From 1 January 2025, the maximum assessment base for all types of social insurance was increased to EUR 15 730 (previously EUR 9,128) monthly. Health insurance assessment base is not capped. Employers also pay injury insurance contributions of 0.8% of employees' total salary costs per month, which are not capped.
The maximum assessment base for the purposes of health insurance is cancelled for all types of income, except dividend income. Dividend income paid out from the profit generated after 1 January 2017 is no longer subject to health insurance contributions. The rate of health insurance contributions for individuals who receive dividend income paid out from the profit generated before 31 December 2016 (except for dividends from listed shares) is 14% of the assessment base. In general, the payer of the dividend needs to withhold the health insurance contribution on the payment of the dividend.
## Special tax on regulated industries
There is a special tax from activities of entities in regulated industries (e.g. energy, insurance and re-insurance, public healthcare insurance, electronic communications, pharmaceuticals, postal services, railway transport, public water distribution and sewerage, air transport). In 2025 pharmacies that have received permission from the State Institute for Drug Control and companies that produce petroleum products will be added to the list of regulated persons. The tax is calculated as a multiple of the tax base, coefficient, and the tax rate. The liability to pay this special tax arises in case the accounting profit exceeds EUR 3 million.
The coefficient (maximum of 1) depends on the amount of income from the regulated activity. As of 1 January 2025, the monthly levy rate for the telecommunication services increases from  0.00363 to 0.01576. From 1 January 2040, it will again be reduced to 0.00363. For the petroleum industry the rate is established at 0.025.
## Special tax on banks
The special levy payable by certain financial institutions (bank levy) has been cancelled effective as of 1 January 2021.
From 1 January 2024 the special tax on banks is recovered. It applies to the banks and other institutions having license from the National bank of Slovakia or similar EU institution. The tax applicable to the banks is 0.025. This rate will gradually decrease and from the accounting period starting from 1 January 2028 it will constitute 0.00363.
## Insurance premium tax (IPT)
IPT of 8% applies to non-life insurance premiums in Slovakia and is payable by insurance companies.
## Motor vehicle tax
Vehicle tax applies to vehicles that are registered in the Slovak Republic and used for business purposes. The taxpayer is the entity that uses the vehicle for business purposes. The tax rate depends on engine capacity, vehicle size, etc. The motor vehicle tax is administrated by the Tax Office.
## Financial transaction tax
From 1 January 2025, a new Financial transaction tax is introduced. The first tax period will be April 2025.
Taxpayers will be individual entrepreneurs, legal entities, and branches of foreign entities that are clients of a payment service provider performing financial transactions. Exceptions include the Social Insurance Agency and budgetary organisations.
The law distinguishes between the taxable person and the person responsible for the tax collection and transfer to the budget. Payment service providers (banks and similar institutions) that have a registered office or branch in Slovakia will collect the tax from taxpayers and remit it to the tax administrator. If a Slovak entrepreneur is a client of a payment service provider seated outside Slovakia and with no branch here, the obligation to declare and pay this tax will be the responsibility of the respective entrepreneur. This obligation will still apply if the entrepreneur authorises another entity to perform the financial transaction. The law provides a rather extensive list of exceptions: e.g. payment of taxes, levies, and similar; purchase of government bonds; certain operations of a securities dealer related to the purchase of securities on behalf of a client, etc.
Subject of the tax: 1) Financial transactions resulting in debiting the entrepreneur’s bank account with a specific amount. 2) Use of a payment card issued to a business account. 3) Charged expense related to the performance of a financial transaction that applies to the entrepreneur’s activities carried out in Slovakia.
The basic tax rate is 0.4%, but a maximum of 40 euros from the tax base. The annual rate for a payment card is two euros.
The taxable period is a calendar month. The deadline for filing a tax return and paying the tax is the end of the calendar month immediately following the taxable period.
In addition to filing tax returns, detailed records for individual taxable periods should be kept to the extent necessary to determine the tax correctly.
## Tax on sweetened soft drinks (Sugar Tax) in Slovakia as of 2025
As of 1 January 2025, the final version of the Sugar Tax Act introduces a tax on selected packaged sweetened soft drinks and packaged concentrates containing added sugar or a sweetener. As regards taxation, the separate category of sweetened soft drinks (packaged drinks or packaged concentrates) with a precisely determined caffein content (more than 150 mg/l (caffeine sugar-sweetened soft drinks) has been modified.
The tax rate for caffeine sugar-sweetened soft drinks will be twice as high as for sweetened soft drinks with caffeine content below the above limit, i.e. €0.30/l for packaged soft drinks for direct consumption, and €2.10/l or €8.60/kg for packaged concentrates of these soft drinks.
The act also defines exemptions from taxation for packaged sweetened soft drinks that are initial baby food, follow-on baby food, food for special medical purposes, total food replacement for weight regulation, or packaged concentrates that are a medicine or a nutritional supplement.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Based on the amendment of the Income tax Act (ITA), valid as of 18 April 2023, the withholding taxation of interest and other income from the commercial corporate bonds issued by Slovak issuers has been abolished. Interest and other income from the commercial corporate bonds were subject to the Slovak withholding tax (WHT) from 1 January 2023 to 17 April 2023.
Additionally, the spin-off concept has been introduced into the Slovak commercial law along with the relevant tax provisions. The relevant legislative provisions took effect from 1 March 2024. Generally, the tax rules for spin-offs follows the already existing tax rules for mergers and demergers, i.e. the transaction should be done at fair market value in most cases.
As of 1 January, 2025 a new consolidation package will come to effect bringing significant changes to CIT, VAT rates. A new financial transactions tax (FTT) and tax on sweetened soft drinks (Sugar tax) are introduced from 1 January 2025. Please see more information in the relevant sections.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A company is a tax resident in the Slovak Republic if it:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is created if:
The conditions for creating a PE may be regulated in more detail by a DTT.
A PE need not be entered in the Slovak Commercial Register, but a foreign entrepreneur with a Slovak PE is taxable in Slovakia. A foreign entrepreneur with a Slovak PE has the same tax registration, filing, payment, and tax advance payment obligations as a Slovak company. The tax base of a PE may not be less than one that which would have been achieved if similar activities under similar conditions were performed as an independent entity (e.g. a Slovak company).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Tangible fixed assets (acquisition value over EUR 1,700) are classified into seven tax depreciation groups to which different depreciation periods apply. The possibility to use accelerated tax depreciation methods is limited to assets belonging to the tax depreciation groups 2 and 3.
| Depreciation group | Assets | Depreciation (years) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Battery-electric cars or plug-in hybrid personal cars, bicycles and scooters with an auxiliary electric motor | 2 |
| 1 | Motor vehicles, office machines and computers, tools and implements, trolleybuses, electric buses | 4 |
| 2 | Combustion engines, outboard engines, most production line equipment, furniture | 6 |
| 3 | Electric motors, turbines, air-conditioning systems | 8 |
| 4 | Buildings made of metal, ships, railway locomotives | 12 |
| 5 | Buildings not involved in depreciation group no. 6 and engineer‘s sites not included in other depreciation groups | 20 |
| 6 | Administrative and residential buildings, hotels and buildings for culture, education, health, and public entertainment | 40 |
Taxpayers do not have to depreciate an asset every year. Tax depreciation may be interrupted in any year and continued in a later year without a loss of the total tax depreciation available.
A lessee can depreciate a tangible fixed asset held under a financial lease. The tax depreciation base equals the acquisition value of the leased asset without VAT and financing costs plus expenses related to acquisition of the leased asset that the lessee incurred before the asset was put into use. The assets acquired under finance lease shall be amortised proportionally or using an accelerated method.
The value to be used as the basis for tax depreciation depends on how the asset is acquired and is usually based on one of the following:
## Goodwill
Amortisation of purchased goodwill, including the goodwill on purchase of a business as a going concern, if it represents an identifiable intangible asset, is tax deductible over up to seven consecutive tax years.
For goodwill created at the contribution of business as a going concern or goodwill created at a merger, the tax deductibility of the goodwill depends on the method of tax treatment of this reorganisation. In general, if the reorganisation is performed for tax purposes at fair market values, the goodwill created will be tax deductible.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are tax deductible in the period when incurred.
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans for the acquisition of shares is tax deductible only in the period of their sale and if the income from this sale is not tax exempt.
## Bad debt provisions
Provisions for unsecured receivables from loans created by banks, and bad debts of regular commercial companies, are fully tax deductible (subject to certain conditions) once the debt has been overdue for more than 1,080 days (20% of the bad debt is tax deductible when it has been overdue for more than 360 days, and 50% after 720 days), provided certain conditions are met. Provisions for bad debts in other circumstances can also be tax deductible if specific conditions are met (e.g. bad debts registered in bankruptcy proceedings).
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are treated as gifts, which are not tax deductible.
## Pension expenses
Contributions to supplementary pension savings made by the Slovak employer on behalf of the employee, up to 6% of the gross salary of the employee participating in these plans, are tax deductible.
## Fines and penalties
In general, penalties and fines are not tax deductible. Contractual fines and late payment interest are tax deductible upon the payment.
## Allowance for students
Subject to specific conditions, taxpayers may deduct from their tax base a special allowance with respect to practical education provided to students of up to EUR 3,200 per student per year.
## Transporting employees to place of work
The employer’s expenses incurred on transporting employees to their place of work and back are tax deductible under the following conditions:
## Taxes
Road tax, real estate tax, financial transaction tax and most other such taxes are tax deductible. Social security contributions paid by an employer with respect to employees are also tax deductible. VAT charged to profit and loss is tax deductible only if certain conditions are met.
## Other non-deductible expenses
Expenses are generally tax deductible if incurred to generate, secure, and maintain the entity’s taxable income. However, certain other costs are specifically not tax deductible. These include entertainment costs, various provisions (e.g. provisions to tangible and intangible assets, certain bad debt provisions), and various expenses in excess of statutory limits (e.g. employee travel expenses and meal allowances).
## Net operating losses
A company or a branch may currently carry forward and utilise:
The new rules also apply to micro taxpayers (with taxable revenues up to EUR 100,000 (previously 60,000 EUR)) in respect of tax losses generated during tax periods since 1 January 2021, where the above-mentioned 50% limitation would not apply.
Carryback of losses is not available in the Slovak Republic.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, deductions may be claimed for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts are at arm’s length and subject to other limitations by the law (e.g. thin capitalisation rules).
## Hybrid mismatches
As of 1 January 2020, the anti-hybrid rules apply in Slovakia in respect of situations arising between a corporate taxpayer and its related parties (e.g. between a taxpayer and a subsidiary abroad, between the PEs of a taxpayer). Hybrid mismatches also apply to unrelated parties that create a structured arrangement (i.e. an agreement that includes a hybrid mismatch).
According to the Slovak ITA, the following situations are qualified as a hybrid mismatch:
Application of new rules would limit tax deductibility of expenses related to hybrid mismatches (subject to certain exemption).

# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
There is no concept of group CIT in the Slovak Republic. Each company in a group is taxed individually.
## Transfer pricing
Under the transfer pricing rules, prices in transactions between a Slovak company and its related parties should be at arm’s length, which means the prices should be at rates similar to those that would be charged between unrelated parties for the same or similar transactions under comparable conditions.
Starting from 1 January 2023 transactions must follow transfer pricing rules when exceeding EUR 10,000 and in the case of financial transactions when principal exceeds EUR 50,000. Also possibility to use the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines was directly included to the law..
The transfer pricing documentation requirements also apply to domestic-related parties in addition to the rules for foreign-related parties. This means that the prices used between two Slovak related parties need to be set at an arm's-length basis for tax purposes. All provisions of the law on methods of determining such prices for the purpose of adjusting the tax base and the obligation to keep associated transfer pricing documentation also apply to domestic-related parties.
If transactions between the related parties are not made at arm’s length, and this results in a reduction in the Slovak entity’s corporate tax base, then the tax authorities can adjust the corporate tax base to that which it would have been if arm’s-length prices had been used.
Based on the amendment of the ITA as of 1 January 2017, Slovak tax residents can request approval of an advance pricing agreement (APA) by the tax authorities. The amendment also sets fees for such APA approval in an amount of EUR 10,000 for unilateral APA approval and EUR 30,000 for multilateral APA approval (approval based on application of DTT).
In some cases, doubled penalties can be imposed for transfer pricing adjustments made by the Slovak tax authorities as a result of a tax audit initiated after 1 January 2017.
### Transfer pricing documentation
All Slovak taxpayers must keep sufficient transfer pricing documentation to justify prices charged by or to their foreign-related parties. The Slovak Ministry of Finance has issued a guideline setting out detailed requirements for transfer pricing documentation (the Guideline).
The EU code of conduct was not formally implemented. However, the Guideline requires maintaining transfer pricing documentation in a form generally in line with the EU standards.
Slovak tax inspectors may require transfer pricing documentation. The deadline to provide transfer pricing documentation for taxpayers is 15 days, and the tax authority may request transfer pricing documentation without the formal opening of a tax audit. Without such documentation, transfer pricing adjustments (increased tax base) are much more likely to be imposed.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
An amendment to the Act on International Cooperation in Tax Administration valid from 1 March 2017 introduced CbC reporting based on the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) plan with an aim to introduce automatic exchange of tax information between countries.
If consolidated revenues for a multinational enterprise (MNE) group of entities are higher than EUR 750 million for the immediately preceding financial year, the group is required to file CbC reporting.
The amendment defines parent entity, substitute parent entity, and principal entity. In most cases, the parent entity is obligated to file CbC reporting in the country in which it is the tax resident.
If a Slovak tax resident is not considered to be a parent entity, a substitute entity, or a principal entity (i.e. the entity that is required to file CbC reporting), it must announce to the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic the business name, address, identification number, and country of tax residence of the reporting entity by the filing due date of its income tax return. This notification requirement should already apply to the 2016 tax period.
The concept of a secondary obligation has also been introduced, which delegates the obligation to submit the CbC report to a surrogate parent entity or to another basic entity of the MNE if the parent or surrogate parent entity that is not the Slovak company does not prepare and submit the CbC report in the country of its tax residence. Therefore, Slovak tax residents may also be required to prepare a CbC report.
For the accounting periods starting from 22 June 2024, the Slovak companies that are members of the MNE groups will have to disclose information about the CIT paid in the jurisdictions of the group’s presence. Generally, Slovak legislation regarding this disclosure is in line with the relevant EU Directive. The Slovak company may not be required to prepare the report but must provide reference to the report prepared and published by another group’s member. As required by the EU Directive, the report will be publicly available.
## Thin capitalisation and interest limitation rule
The limit for the maximum amount of tax-deductible interest and related fees on credits and loans between related parties is established as 25% of the adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), i.e. the sum of:
From 1 January 2024, additional interest limitation rules will apply, though only to the contracts and amendments to the already existing contracts concluded after 31 December 2023.
A taxpayer first checks if the interest expenses fall under the interest limitation rules; if not, the ’already in place‘ thin capitalisation rules should be checked. The main features of the Slovak interest limitation rules are generally in line with the ATAD:
The law provides examples of the interest income and interest expenses to be used for the net interest calculation. However, as the list includes other similar payments equivalent to interest, there could be some uncertainty about the net interest expense calculation in some cases.
Banks and insurance companies are not subject to the interest limitation rules and not subject to the thin capitalisation rules.
## Controlled foreign corporations (CFCs)
The rules for CFCs seek to tax income artificially diverted by a Slovak parent company to a CFC if the income is paid without economic justification or to obtain a tax advantage for the Slovak company.
A company is considered a CFC if:
If income is diverted to a PE, it will only be sufficient (for purposes of the CFC assessment) to fulfil the second condition (i.e. the condition regarding the hypothetical Slovak tax).
The CFC’s income will be taxed in Slovakia by including the CFC’s tax base in the tax base of the Slovak parent company to the extent it is attributable to the assets/risks related to the significant functions of the Slovak company, which manages and controls the CFC.
To avoid double taxation, the Slovak parent company will be able to factor in the tax paid by the CFC abroad when calculating/paying tax in Slovakia.
The application of adjustments to the CFC tax base in line with transfer pricing rules will take precedence over the application of CFC rules for the taxation of profits.
The CFC rules apply for tax periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019.
As part of the Slovak financial administration activities against tax evasion, the CFC rules will be extended to natural persons. Based on these, individuals who are Slovak tax residents will be taxable on income attributable to them from their foreign company or an entity controlled by them, provided the CFC’s income has not been taxed abroad at the minimum level of the effective tax rate or the CFC is established in a non-cooperative jurisdiction.
The attributable income will be taxed at 25% or 35% at the moment of the right to a claim (i.e. without the need for its actual payment). The amendment provides for exceptions where this procedure will not apply.
## Treatment of inter-company items
In general, royalties, commissions, and other payments paid to foreign-related parties are tax deductible, provided they are incurred for genuine business reasons and the charges are in line with transfer pricing rules.

# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A foreign company may trade through a Slovak branch, which must be registered in the Slovak Commercial Register. The taxable income of the branch must not be lower than that which an independent entity (e.g. a Slovak company) would achieve from carrying out similar activities under similar conditions. If the branch’s taxable income cannot be assessed based on its income less costs, as adjusted for tax purposes, certain other methods may be used. A taxpayer may ask the tax authorities in writing to approve such a method.

# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Various conditions must be met in order for a company to qualify for state aid. These include a minimum amount of investment in fixed assets, where the amount depends mainly on the type of project and where it is located, or a minimum number of newly created jobs.
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives (including tax credits) are potentially available for projects in the following areas:
The granting of a tax relief is subject to approval of the Slovak authorities. If certain conditions are met, a taxpayer may apply tax relief in the ten subsequent years following the tax period in which the relief was granted.
### Investment deduction
As of 1 January 2022, taxpayers are eligible to apply a newly introduced additional investment deduction, according to which taxpayers may deduct the determined percentage of expense from depreciation from the investment, the amount of which depends on the planned percentage of reinvestment of the average value of investments and the value of reinvestment of this planned average value of investments stipulated in the investment plan as stated in the table below:
| Re-invested average value of investments | Investment deduction based on the value of the planned amount of reinvestment of the average value of investments | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EUR 1 million to EUR 20 million | More than EUR 20 million to EUR 50 million | More than EUR 50 million |
| 700% to 1,399.99% | 15% | 25% | 50% |
| 1,400% or more | 20% | 30% | 55% |
The investment deduction shall be applied to the investments put into use during the investment plan and can be applied within the depreciation period of the assets up to a maximum of ten consecutive tax periods following the tax period in which the assets were put into use.
According to the amendments to the Slovak ITA valid from 1 January 2020, the total of the following items may be deducted from the tax base adjusted by the tax loss deduction:
If a tax loss is recorded or if the tax base after the tax loss deduction is lower than the available deduction, the deduction may be applied in the next taxable period in which the taxpayer reports a positive tax base; however, this may not exceed five taxable periods immediately following the period in which the entitlement to make a deduction arose.
## Tax exemption for intangible assets (Patent box)
The amendment of ITA valid since 1 January 2018 introduced a tax exemption of 50% for income from considerations for granting a right to use, or for using, a protected patent, utility model, or software created by the taxpayer (basic patent box). Tax exemption refers only to assets created by own activities and applies to tax periods in which amortisation of an intangible asset is included in tax expenses.
A similar exemption also applies to a certain part of income from selling goods that were manufactured on the basis of a protected patent or a utility model (extended patent box). Tax exemption accounts for 50% of income attributed to the sales price, less related costs and less profit margin.
Entities applying this tax exemption are entered in a public register kept by the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic.
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign tax credits are available if allotted under an applicable DTT.

# Slovak Republic
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Business combinations
The amendments to the Commercial Code from November 2017 have strengthened the legal and administrative requirements for carrying out mergers, fusions, and demergers of commercial companies (e.g. new obligation to submit a draft contract for a merger or demerger project to the tax authorities no later than 60 days before the date on which these transactions are to be approved by the company bodies).
In 2018, in-kind contributions, mergers, fusions, and demergers of commercial companies may only be performed for tax purposes in most cases at fair (market) values. Under this method, the taxpayer should value assets for tax purposes using their current market values, and the revaluation difference must be reflected in the appropriate company’s tax returns within seven years of the transaction.
The historical price method may only be applied for mergers, fusions, and demergers of commercial companies, in-kind contributions, or cross-border transactions if certain conditions are met.
With effect from 1 March 2024, a new Act on Conversions of Companies and Co-operatives (the ’Conversion Act‘) has been approved. The Conversion Act introduces the spin-off concept to the commercial and tax law. A spin-off is a transaction where the company being split up does not cease to exist, but an appropriately specified part of its capital is transferred to one or more successors.
Overall, for tax purposes, spin-offs are treated in the same way as mergers and demergers, i.e. fair market value should apply to the spun-off assets. In some exceptional cases the historical prices can be used.
## Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Slovakia has adopted most of the principles of IFRS in its accounting law. However, there are still some differences between IFRS and Slovak accounting standards.
### Obligation to prepare statutory financial statements according to IFRS
Financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, etc.) must prepare their statutory financial statements according to IFRS. In addition, a company that fulfils two or more of the following conditions, in two consecutive accounting periods, may opt to prepare its statutory financial statements according to IFRS:
An entity may decide to prepare its financial statements under IFRS if certain conditions are met.
If the Slovak taxpayer is obligated to prepare its financial statements under IFRS, the tax base is derived from either:

## International agreements
The Slovak/United States (US) Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) entered into force during 2015. However, financial institutions in the Slovak Republic were allowed to register on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) registration website consistent with the treatment of having an IGA in effect even earlier.
FATCA was implemented into Slovak legislation with effect from 1 January 2016, with a first reporting deadline of 30 June 2016.
The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) was also implemented into Slovak legislation with effect from 1 January 2016, and the first reporting deadline to the Slovak tax authorities was 30 June 2017.
## EU Mandatory Disclosure Rules (DAC6)
Slovakia has implemented provisions of the EU Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation (DAC6) into its local law, imposing reporting obligation on intermediaries or clients (in case intermediaries are subject to professional privilege) in respect to the cross-border reportable arrangement (i.e. arrangements involving more than one member state or a member state and a third country).
The cross-border arrangement is to be reportable, provided at least one of the hallmarks (generic or specific) from the list set by the act is met. Some of the hallmarks are also subject to the main benefit test (i.e. where tax benefit was the main or one of the main aims of cross-border arrangement).
The specific conditions set by the law should be checked on a case-by-case basis to confirm the related reporting obligations.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
A credit for foreign tax paid by a Slovak tax resident on foreign-source income taxable in the Slovak Republic is available in cases where the DTT concluded between the Slovak Republic and the foreign country states so. The credit of foreign tax can be applied up to the amount of tax that would be payable on that income in the Slovak Republic. If the DTT requires the exemption method to avoid double taxation, this method has to be applied. The taxpayer can also opt, based on Slovak law, to use the exemption method of foreign-source employment income if this method is more favourable for the taxpayer.
If the Slovak Republic has no DTT concluded with a foreign country, the employment income from foreign-source that was taxed abroad can be exempt from taxation in the Slovak Republic.

# Slovak Republic
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Employment expenses
No deductions are available from income from employment, except for statutory health and social insurance contributions. Sums received by way of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with employment are exempt from tax, provided they do not exceed the statutory limits and are not aimed for private use.
## Deduction from certain income from capital
An annual deduction of up to EUR 500 is available from certain types of income from capital, including gains on the sale of shares, and rental income from real estate.
## Personal allowances
The personal allowance of 21 times the minimum subsistence amount announced on 1 January each year is available to all individuals whose annual tax base does not exceed a certain limit. If the tax base of a taxpayer exceeds a certain limit, the personal allowance is reduced to nil progressively, based on a formula.
For 2025, the personal allowance is set at EUR 5,753.79 based on the minimum subsistence amount valid on 1 January 2025. Individuals whose tax base for 2025 is higher than EUR 25.426.27 cannot apply the entire non-taxable personal allowance. Their personal allowance is reduced to nil progressively, based on a formula, so that those with an annual tax base equal to or higher than EUR 48,441,43 in 2025 are not entitled to any personal allowance.
A dependent spouse allowance of up to 19.2 times the minimum subsistence amount can also be claimed in 2025 by Slovak tax residents with permanent residence in Slovakia, provided the spouse does not have income in excess of the allowance amount (i.e. EUR 5,260.61 in 2024). The amount of the spouse allowance depends on the level of the individual’s and spouse’s 2025 incomes and is based on a formula. However, if the individual's tax base is equal to or higher than EUR 48,441,43in 2025, the individual will not be entitled to any spouse allowance. A Slovak tax non-resident can claim the spouse allowance only if 90% of one’s worldwide income is from Slovak sources.
Personal and dependent spouse allowance can decrease only the income from employment, business, or other self-employment.
The spouse allowance is applied only if the spouse is living with the taxpayer in the common household and is taking care of a dependent child, receives a cash allowance for nursing, is registered with an employment centre and is actively seeking a job, is considered a disabled individual, or is a severely disabled individual.
## Business deductions
Private entrepreneurs may deduct ordinary business expenses incurred to maintain, secure, and generate business income, provided they keep accounts recording their income and costs. For rental income, the costs should be recorded in the sequential order.
As an alternative, an entrepreneur (apart from a person having just rental income) who is not a Slovak VAT payer can opt to deduct lump-sum expenses of 60% (up to yearly amount of EUR 20,000) of income in order to determine the taxable income. In this case, actual business expenses or rental costs are not tax deductible.
## Tax bonus for young people on mortgage interest paid
Individuals between 18 and 35 may deduct 50% of the interest paid on mortgage during five years, up to EUR 1,200 annually. Interest bonus is claimed by individuals whose average monthly income is up to 1.6 times the average monthly salary of employees in the economy.

# Slovak Republic
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Employment income
Taxable remuneration from employment includes all remuneration, whether monetary or non-monetary, including in-kind benefits provided to an employee. Statutory health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employee reduce taxable income. Obligatory employer’s health insurance and social security contributions paid by the employer are not part of the employee’s taxable income.
Employers must keep Slovak payroll records for employees and members of their statutory bodies.
### Taxable benefit of employer-provided car
The taxable benefit for a car provided by the employer is 1% of the car’s purchase price for each calendar month or partial month during which the car is available for business and private use. Fuel costs paid by the employer for an employee’s private use are also a taxable benefit, as is the reimbursement of travel expenses in excess of statutory limits.
Computation of benefit-in-kind resulting from the use of a company car for business and private purposes should reflect the period of using the car. An employee's income for every calendar month (that is even started) of using the car for business and private purposes will include 1% of the employer's car acquisition price (including VAT) in the first year of putting the car into use. In the next seven calendar years, the employer's car acquisition price (including VAT) should be annually decreased by 12.5% as of the first day of each calendar year for this purpose.
### Provision of meals to employees and tax on employment income
The tax-free amount related to the provision of meals to employees has been changed. As of 1 September 2024, only the employer’s contribution of up to 55% of the value of the meal allowance provided for a business trip lasting 5 to 12 hours, i.e. currently up to EUR 4.57, will be exempt from the employees’ employment income tax, regardless of the form in which the meal is provided.
This means that regardless of whether an employer provides meals via its own canteen, in a canteen of another employer, via a third person, a meal voucher, or a financial meal allowance, the amount of the employer’s meal allowance exceeding EUR 4.57 will be the employee’s taxable income, except for the part of the allowance provided from the employer’s social fund.
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax in the Slovak Republic. Gain on the sale of non-business property is exempt from taxation if the individual owned property for minimum of five years or has used the property for non-business purposes for longer than five years.
Capital gains enter into the individual’s tax base and are subject to income tax.
Capital gains from the sale of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange are exempt from tax if held for more than one year. Further, income from special saving schemes are also exempt from tax if participation lasts for at least 15 years and certain other conditions are met.
## Dividend income
The recently approved amendment of the ITA changed taxation of dividend income in Slovakia. Dividend income from profits arising from 2004 to 2016 is not subject to Slovak tax (subject to anti avoidance provisions). However, the dividend income from profits arising from 1 January 2017 and later years will be subject to a 7% tax rate (WHT applies if paid from a Slovak company). The same 7% tax rate will also apply to dividend income arising from profits before 2004.
Dividend income from profits arising in 2024 will be subject to 10% tax rate (WHT applies if paid from a Slovak company). Dividend income from profits arising from 1 January 2025 will be subject to 7% tax rate (WHT applies if paid from a Slovak company).
## Investment income
Taxable investment income includes interest and other yields from securities, interest, winnings, income from savings on deposit accounts, yields from supplementary pension insurance, and yields from life insurance after passing a certain age. Some of these types of income are subject to WHT, unless they are received from abroad, in which case they are treated as part of the tax base. The WHT may be reduced under DTTs for individuals who are not Slovak tax residents. Income from bonds arising to a foreign taxpayer is not subject to taxation in Slovakia.
