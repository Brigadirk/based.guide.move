## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Any person making the following payments is required to withhold income tax at the time of payment at the rates listed below. The tax withheld must be paid to the Internal Revenue Department (IRD) within 15 days from the date of withholding.
Tax withheld from payments to residents (and branches registered in Myanmar) will be set off against the tax due on their final assessments. Tax withheld from payments to non-resident companies (except the branches registered in Myanmar) is a final tax.
The application of certain tax treaty rates/exemptions may be at the discretion of the IRD in current practice.
For payments made by state organisations, state enterprises, development committees, co-operative societies, foreign companies, foreign enterprises and organisations, local companies, and under an existing law for purchase of goods, work performed, or supply of services within the country under a tender, contract, quotation, or other modes, the WHT rate is 2% if the payment is made to a resident and 2.5% if it is made to a non-resident. With effect from 1 July 2018, the payment made by private businesses to a resident is no longer subject to the WHT of 2%. The 2% WHT shall still be applicable on payments made by the government (i.e. union level organisations, Union Ministries, Naypyitaw Council, regional or state government, state-owned enterprises, and municipal organisations) to a resident in relation to purchase of goods, work performed, and supply of services within the country. With effect from 1 September 2023, the Ministry of Planning and Finance has introduced a new WHT applicable category that imposes 2% WHT on the fees received by private healthcare professionals.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties |
| Resident national or resident foreigner | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| Non-resident corporations and individuals: |  |  |  |
| Non-treaty | 0 | 15 | 15 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |
| India | 0 | 10 (2) | 10 |
| Korea, Republic of | 0 | 10 (2) | 10/15 (3) |
| Laos | 0 | 10 | 10 |
| Malaysia | 0 | 10 (2) | 10 |
| Singapore | 0 | 8/10 (2, 4) | 10/15 (3) |
| Thailand | 0 | 10 (2) | 5/10/15 (5) |
| United Kingdom | 0 | Not covered | 0 (6) |
| Vietnam | 0 | 10 (2) | 10 |
Notes
1. There is no WHT on dividends, branch profits, and share of profits of an association of persons that have been taxed.
2. Exempt if paid to the government.
3. Lower rate for payments in connection with patents, designs, secret formulas/processes, or industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment/experience.
4. Lower rate if received by a bank or a financial institution.
5. The 5% rate applies for payments in connection with copyrights of literary, artistic, or scientific work, and the 10% rate applies to payments for services of a managerial or consultancy nature, and for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
6. Exempt if the amount is fair and reasonable.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Income is categorised as income from a profession, business, property, capital gains, other sources, and undisclosed sources, as well as income that has escaped tax assessment. Income from capital gains is assessed separately.
Tax is levied on total income, after the deduction of allowable expenditure and depreciation.
The Ministry of Planning and Finance, with the approval of the government, may, by notification, prescribe, amend, and add assessable income and rates of income tax.
## Inventory valuation
There are no prescribed inventory valuation methods for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Myanmar has a one-tier corporate tax system, under which shares of profits received by a Myanmar taxpayer from an association of persons (i.e. partnerships, joint ventures, companies, etc.) are exempted from income tax.
## Interest income
Interest income and income from movable property are treated as business income.
## Royalty income
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the taxability of royalty income. Royalty income is generally treated as business income.
## Foreign income
Resident companies (except the MIC-registered companies) are taxed on a worldwide basis, and, as such, income from sources outside Myanmar is taxable in Myanmar.
Non-resident companies and MIC-registered companies are not taxed on their foreign income.
There is no deferral regime available to foreign income in Myanmar.

## Social security contributions
The Social Security Act 2012 requires an employer with more than five workers to provide Social Security Scheme benefits to one’s workers, such as health and social care insurance as well as insurance against employment-related injuries.
The rates of contribution by employees and employers are 2% and 3% of the total salaries and wages, respectively. The contribution must be in Myanmar kyats regardless of the currency in which the employee is paid.
With effect from 1 April 2014, the maximum monthly contribution is limited to MMK 9,000 by the employer and MMK 6,000 by the employee.
Contributions are deductible by the employee for tax purposes. The employer is obligated to withhold the employees’ contributions from their salaries.
## Capital gains taxes
Income tax is levied on gains from the sale, exchange, or transfer of capital assets (i.e. any land, building, vehicle, and any capital assets of an enterprise, which include shares, bonds, and similar instruments) and intangibles (to the extent they fall within the definition of capital assets).
Capital gains are calculated based on the difference between sale proceeds and the cost of assets and any additions, less tax depreciation allowed.
Residents and non-residents are taxed at 10% on their capital gains. Different rates apply for capital gains from the sale, exchange, or transfer of capital assets relating to companies engaged in upstream oil and gas activities relating to exploration, drilling, and extraction within Myanmar.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Myanmar.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Myanmar.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Foreign investors may register their companies under the Myanmar Companies Act (CA) or in conjunction with the Myanmar Investment Law (MIL) or Myanmar Special Economic Zone Law (Myanmar SEZ Law). The new MIL 2016 was enacted on 18 October 2016. The new MIL is a consolidation of the Myanmar Citizen Investment Law (2013) and the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (MFIL) (2012). The Myanmar Citizen Investment Law and MFIL have been repealed with effect from 18 October 2016. New rules governing the implementation of the new MIL were enacted on 30 March 2017. Investment permits issued under the old investment laws continue to be valid.
The differences between companies registered under the CA and the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC)/SEZ are in relation to their eligibility for tax incentives and longer land use terms, as well as minimum foreign share capital requirements.
Generally, resident companies are taxed on a worldwide basis, and, as such, income from sources outside Myanmar is taxable.
Non-resident companies and MIC-registered companies are taxed only on income derived from sources within Myanmar. Income received from any capital assets within Myanmar and from any source of income within Myanmar is deemed to be income received within Myanmar. The income is generally subject to tax under the normal rules for residents.
A company registered under the MIC/SEZ is entitled to enjoy certain exemptions and relief from taxes (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](myanmar/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for details*).
| Type of taxpayer or income | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Companies incorporated in Myanmar under the Myanmar CA or Special Companies Act | 22\* |
| Enterprises operating under the MIC or SEZ | 22\* |
| Non-resident foreign organisations registered under the Myanmar CA or Special Companies Act, such as a branch of a foreign company | 22\* |
| Companies operating in the oil and gas exploration and production sector | 25 |
| Public companies listed on the Yangon Stock Exchange | 17 |
\* Prior to 1 October 2021, the corporate tax rate was 25%.
## Local income taxes
There is no separate corporate income tax at the local level.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT in Myanmar.
## Commercial tax
Commercial tax, at rates ranging from 0% to 15%, is levied as a turnover tax on goods and services. Generally, commercial tax is imposed at the rate of 5%. The commercial tax that a business charges and collects is known as output tax, which has to be paid to the Myanmar tax authorities. Commercial tax incurred on business purchases and expenses are known as input tax. Businesses that are registered for commercial tax can claim commercial input tax if certain conditions are satisfied.
Commercial tax is imposed on a wide range of specified goods and services traded, produced, or rendered within the country, based on the sales proceeds, and on imported goods (*see Customs duties below for details*). There are 47 types of goods exempted from commercial tax.
Most services are subject to 5% commercial tax, except for the services below:
There are also 34 types of services that are specifically exempt from commercial tax (e.g. life insurance, banking and financial services that are operated with the permission of the Central Bank of Myanmar, microfinance, public transportation, publishing services).
No commercial tax is imposed if the proceeds from production and sales of goods, receipts from services, or proceeds from trading for a financial year are not more than MMK 50 million.
Commercial tax is zero-rated on all exports, except for electricity (8%) and crude oil (5%).
The Ministry of Planning and Finance, with the approval from the Union Government Cabinet, may grant relief or exemption from commercial tax in respect of activities carried out with donations or assistance of loans from domestic or foreign organisations.
Companies registered under the MIC/SEZ may, at the discretion of the MIC/SEZ Committee, be granted exemption from commercial tax during certain stipulated periods (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](myanmar/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for details*).
## Specific goods tax
The Specific Goods Tax Law replaces commercial tax on a list of specific goods that are imported into Myanmar, manufactured in Myanmar, or exported to a foreign country. The list of specific goods include cigarettes, tobacco leaves, virginia leaves, cheroots, cigars, pipe tobaccos, and betel-chewing tobacco; beers, wine, and alcoholic beverages; wood logs and wood cuttings; vans, saloons, sedans and estate wagons, and coupe cars except double cab 4-door pickups from the range of 1501 cc to 4001 cc and above; and kerosene, petrol, diesel, and aviation jet fuel, as well as natural gas. The specific goods tax rates range from 5% to 80%.
Specific goods tax is exempted on all exports, except for wood logs and wood cuttings, which are subject to tax at 10%.
Under the Specific Goods Tax Law, only a manufacturer of special goods can claim and offset the specific goods tax incurred on purchase of raw materials/semi-finished goods against the specific goods tax charged on sale of specific goods.
Companies registered under the MIC/SEZ may, at the discretion of the MIC/SEZ Committee, be granted exemption from internal taxes, which may cover specific goods tax, during certain stipulated periods (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](myanmar/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for details*).
## Gems tax
Under the Union Taxation Law (UTL) 2023, gemstones (whether it is rough or cut or jewellery or things made with gemstones) shall be subject to gems tax in accordance with Section 38 of the Myanmar Gemstone Law 2019. The tax rates are ranging from 5% to 11%.
## Customs duties
Customs duty was previously levied under the Customs Tariff of Myanmar (2017). The Myanmar Customs Tariff 2022 is now applied starting from 1st October 2022 at rates of up to 60%.
Companies registered under the MIC/SEZ may, at the discretion of the MIC/SEZ Committee, be granted exemption from customs duties during certain stipulated periods (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](myanmar/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for details*).
## Excise duties
## Property taxes
Immovable property (land and buildings) in Myanmar is subject to property tax.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duty is levied on various types of instruments, and some rates are given below:
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains tax is levied on gains from the sale, exchange, or transfer of capital assets (i.e. any land, building, vehicle, and any capital assets of an enterprise, which include shares, bonds, and similar instruments).
Capital gains from the sale, exchange, or transfer of capital assets in the oil and gas sector (companies engaged in upstream oil and gas activities relating to exploration, drilling, and extraction) are taxed at different rates from those in other sectors.
| Type of taxpayer | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Resident companies | 10 |
| Non-resident companies | 10 |
| Transfer of shares in companies engaged in upstream oil and gas activities relating to exploration, drilling, and extraction or interest in production sharing contracts | 40 to 50 |
Tax returns for capital gains must be filed within 30 days from the date of disposal of the capital assets. Capital gains tax payments are required to be made within 30 days from the date of disposal of the capital assets. Previously, resident taxpayers paid capital gains tax and other income tax in kyats, irrespective of whether they had foreign currency income. Now, resident taxpayers must pay tax in the type of currency received, in the same manner as non-resident taxpayers always had to.
## Registration taxes
There is a registration fee of MMK 150,000 payable to the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration for setting up a private company or a branch in Myanmar. In addition to the registration fee, there may be other administrative expenses or stamp duty payable on the company’s constitution.
## Payroll taxes
An employer is responsible for deducting income tax due from salaries at the time of payment to employees and must pay the amount within 15 days from the date of deduction. If the employer fails to deduct and pay the tax, the employer is deemed to be a defaulter and held responsible for such payment. In addition, the employer is also responsible for filing the statement of annual salary within three months after the end of the income year, and failure to file by the stipulated deadline may result in a penalty of 10% of the amount of tax to be deducted on annual salaries.
## Social security contributions
An employer with five or more employees is required to provide Social Security Scheme benefits to those workers, such as health and social care insurance and insurance against employment-related injuries.
The rates of contribution by employees and employers are 2% and 3% of the total salaries and wages, respectively. The contribution must be made in Myanmar kyats for all currencies that the salaries are paid in within 15 days of the following month, using the exchange rate prescribed by the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) on the first day of the relevant month.
The maximum contribution is limited to MMK 9,000 by the employer and MMK 6,000 by the employee.
Contributions made by the employees are deductible for tax purposes in the hands of the employees. The employer is obligated to withhold the employees’ contributions from their salaries.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable period of a company is the same as its financial year (income year). Income earned during the financial year is assessed to tax in the assessment year, which is the year following the financial year.
Prior to the financial year 2018/19, the fiscal year was from 1 April to 31 March. The financial period of 31 March year-end was changed to 30 September from the financial year 2018/19 (i.e. from 1 October 2018) for state-owned enterprises and financial institutions and from the financial year 2019/20 (i.e. from 1 October 2019) for all other taxpayers.
The financial year-end of 30 September has changed to 31 March again, starting from 1 October 2021.
## Tax returns
In general, annual income tax returns must be filed within three months from the end of the financial year.
Tax returns for capital gains must be filed within 30 days from the date of disposal of the capital assets.
If a taxpayer discontinues one’s business, returns must be filed within one month from the date of discontinuance of business.
The failure of a taxpayer to file income tax returns, knowing that assessable income has been obtained, is deemed to have ‘fraudulent intention’.
## Payment of tax
Advance corporate tax payments are made in quarterly instalments within ten days from the end of the relevant quarter throughout the income tax year based on the estimated total income for the year. The advance payments and any taxes withheld are creditable against the final tax liability. The date for settling the final tax liability is within 21 days from the date of notice issued by the IRD.
Previously, resident companies had to pay taxes in Myanmar kyats, while non-residents companies that earned income in foreign currency had to pay taxes in earned foreign currency. However, with effect from 1 April 2024, there is no distinction between residents and non-residents for tax payment currency, and both resident and non-resident companies must pay taxes based on the currency in which the income was earned or received.
Capital gains tax needs to be paid within 30 days from the date of disposal of capital assets.
## Tax audit process
Under the Myanmar Income Tax Law, if it is found that there is a fraudulent intention to evade tax, the assessment or reassessment of income tax can be made at any time on the income that has escaped assessment of tax.
Failure by a taxpayer to file a return of income knowing that assessable income has been obtained, failure to comply with the notice of the IRD to submit accounts and documents, including the tax return and profit and loss accounts within the time prescribed, or submitting forged instruments and other documents are included within the meaning of fraudulent intention. If the tax authority in the course of investigation finds that a taxpayer has concealed income or particulars relating to income, the taxpayer may be permitted to fully disclose the facts within the specified time. In addition, the taxpayer must pay a penalty equal to 100% of the tax increased on account of the concealment. If the taxpayer fails to disclose the particulars within the specified time or discloses less than the income concealed, the taxpayer will also be subject to prosecution, in addition to paying the tax and penalty. If the taxpayer is found guilty, the taxpayer may be punishable with imprisonment for between three to ten years.
Under the new TAL that shall be effective from 1 October 2019, the penalties for concealing or providing incorrect information and tax evasion will change as follows:
- the difference between the correct tax due and the tax assessed, or
- the difference between the correct amount of refund and the refund made.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation to raise an assessment is three years after the financial year-end. It does not apply in cases of fraudulent default. Mere filing of the income tax return and payment of advance tax in time does not constitute a final tax assessment.
Under the TAL 2019, with effect from 1 October 2019, the statute of limitation of three years has increased to six years. The Director General of the Internal Revenue Department can conduct an assessment or re-assessment of the taxpayer within a period of six years after the end of the relevant assessment year. In relation to intentional negligence or fraudulent cases, the infinite statute of limitation was replaced with a 12-years period.
The following issues are currently being focused on by the tax authorities:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Resident nationals and foreigners are taxed on their worldwide income under the Myanmar Income Tax Act.
Under the Union Taxation Law (UTL) 2015, non-resident nationals were exempt from income tax on salary income earned and received in foreign countries. With effect from 1 October 2023, the tax exemption is no longer available. Under the Amended UTL 2023, income tax will be imposed on salary income received by non-resident nationals in foreign countries, and the tax paid in foreign countries will be allowed to offset against the Myanmar tax payable.
Non-resident foreigners are taxed only on income derived from sources within Myanmar.
Foreigners working for Union of Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (MFIL) or Myanmar Investment Law (MIL) companies may be taxed at the same tax rates as a tax resident, regardless of their period of stay in Myanmar, under the tax incentives that may be granted to the MFIL/MIL companies.
## Personal income tax rates
| Type of taxpayer or income | Tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| Salaries: |  |
| Resident nationals and resident foreigners | Progressive rates from 1% to 25% with personal tax relief available |
| Non-resident foreigners | Progressive rates from 1% to 25% without personal tax relief |
| Non-resident nationals (on salaries income received in foreign countries) | Lower of the progressive rates from 1% to 25% (with tax relief) or 2% tax on salary (without tax relief) |
| Other income: |  |
| Resident nationals and resident foreigners | Progressive rates from 1% to 25% |
| Non-resident foreigners | 25% |
| Non-resident nationals | 10% |
| Capital gains tax: |  |
| Resident nationals and foreigners | 10% |
| Non-resident foreigners | 10% |
| Rental income | 10% on gross |
Note: No tax is payable if total income under salaries does not exceed MMK 4.8 million a year.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
Prior to 1 October 2019, the taxable period of an individual taxpayer was from 1 April to 31 March. The income tax period for all taxpayers, including individuals, had changed to 1 October to 30 September with effect from 1 October 2019. Starting from 1 October 2021, the income tax year-end for all taxpayers has been reinstated to 31 March.
Income earned during the income tax year is assessed to tax in the assessment year, which is the year following the income tax year.
## Tax returns
In general, income tax returns must be filed within three months from the end of the income year. Tax returns for capital gains must be filed within 30 days from the date of disposal of the capital assets. If a taxpayer discontinues one’s business, returns must be filed within one month from the date of discontinuance of business. The failure of a taxpayer to file income tax returns, knowing that assessable income has been obtained, is deemed to have ‘fraudulent intention’.
## Payment of tax
Advance payments are made in quarterly instalments throughout the income tax year based on the estimated total income for the year. The advance payments and any taxes withheld are creditable against the final tax liability. The date for settling the final tax liability is within 21 days from the date of notice issued by the IRD.
An employer is responsible for deducting income tax due from salaries at the time of payment to employees and must pay the amount within 15 days from the date of deduction. If the employer fails to deduct and pay the tax, the employer is deemed to be a defaulter and held responsible for such payment. In addition, the employer is also responsible for filing the statement of annual salary within three months after the end of the income year, and failure to file within the stipulated deadline may result in a penalty of 10% of the tax to be deducted on the annual salaries.
Previously, resident taxpayers, both citizens and resident foreigners, had to pay taxes in Myanmar kyats, while non-residents who earned income in foreign currency had to pay taxes in earned foreign currency. However, starting from 1 April 2024, all taxpayers, both resident and non-resident, are required to make income tax payments in the same currency earned.
## Tax audit process
Under the Income Tax Law, if it is found that there is a fraudulent intention to evade tax, the assessment or reassessment of income tax can be made at any time on the income that has escaped assessment of tax.
Failure by a taxpayer to file a return of income knowing that assessable income has been obtained, failure to comply with the notice of the IRD to submit accounts and documents, including the tax return and profit and loss accounts within the time prescribed, or submitting forged instruments and other documents are included within the meaning of fraudulent intention. If the tax authority in the course of investigation finds that a taxpayer has concealed income or particulars relating to income, the taxpayer may be permitted to fully disclose the facts within the specified time. In addition, the taxpayer must pay a penalty equal to 100% of the tax increased on account of the concealment. If the taxpayer fails to disclose the particulars within the specified time or discloses less than the income concealed, the taxpayer will also be subject to prosecution, in addition to paying the tax and penalty. If the taxpayer is found guilty, the taxpayer may be punishable with imprisonment for between three to ten years.
Under the new Tax Administration Law (TAL) that shall be effective from 1 October 2019, the penalties for concealing or providing incorrect information and tax evasion will change as follows:
- the difference between correct tax due and the tax assessed, and
- the difference between correct amount of refund and the refund made.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation to raise an assessment is three years after the financial year end. It does not apply in cases of fraudulent default. Mere filing of the income return and payment of advance tax in time does not constitute a final tax assessment.
With the TAL that will be effective from 1 October 2019, the statute of limitation of three years will be increased to six years. The Director General of the IRD can conduct an assessment or re-assessment of the taxpayer within a period of six years after the end of the relevant assessment year. In relation to the intentional negligence or fraudulent cases, the infinite statute of limitation will be replaced with a twelve-year period.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The Republic of the Union of Myanmar (or more commonly known as Myanmar) has an area of 676,578 square kilometres, making it the second largest country in Southeast Asia. It shares borders with Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, and Thailand. Naypyidaw is the capital of Myanmar, and Yangon, as the former capital, is the country’s most important commercial centre.
The official language and primary medium of instruction of Myanmar is Myanmar (the same name as the country). The people are referred to as the Myanmar people or also Myanmar. The Myanmar consists of various ethnic groups, broadly consisting of Burmese (65%), Shan (6.4%), Karen (5.2%), Kachin (1.8%), Chin (1.6%), Mon (1.5%), and Rakhine (1.5%). English is also spoken in cities like Yangon and Mandalay in the north, particularly by the educated urban elite, and is the second language learned in government schools.
Myanmar’s official currency is the Myanmar kyat (MMK).
Myanmar has an economic and trade agreement with Turkey and economic agreements with China, Cuba, Kuwait, Malaysia, and Singapore. It also has trade agreements with Bangladesh, China, India, Israel, Korea (Republic of), Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Myanmar is a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), a signatory to the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS), and a party to the Framework Agreement on the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA).

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
A resident company is a company as defined and formed under the Myanmar CA or any other existing law of Myanmar.
A non-resident company is one that is not formed under the Myanmar CA or any other existing law of Myanmar. Generally, foreign branches registered in Myanmar are deemed to be non-resident companies.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Currently, there is no definition of a PE under the Myanmar Income Tax Act. Under the Myanmar Income Tax Act, the Myanmar tax authorities are empowered to collect income tax from a non-resident foreigner on its income sourced within Myanmar. In current practice, the Myanmar tax authorities seek to collect taxes from a non-resident foreigner on its income received from Myanmar by way of a withholding tax (WHT) mechanism, regardless of whether the foreigner has a PE or taxable presence in Myanmar or not. The term ‘PE’ may be defined in the tax treaties that Myanmar has with other countries. Subject to the relevant tax treaty, a foreigner who is tax resident of the treaty country may not be subject to Myanmar taxes if it does not have a PE in Myanmar.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
In respect of business income, deductions are allowed for expenditure incurred for the purpose of earning income.
Non-deductible items include capital expenditure, personal expenditure, expenditure that is not commensurate with the volume of business, irrelevant expenses and expenses incurred not for production of income, payments made to any member of an association of persons other than a company or a cooperative society, and inappropriate expenditure.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Income from movable property is considered as business income, and depreciation allowance for the cost of such movable property can be deducted. Income from immovable property is generally computed in the same way as business income, except that no depreciation allowance can be deducted.
Technically, a taxpayer entity is required to claim tax depreciation on the qualifying assets used for its business purposes based on rates prescribed under the Myanmar Income Tax Law, using a prescribed tax depreciation claim form. A taxpayer is entitled to full-year tax depreciation in the year the asset is acquired. On the other hand, no tax depreciation is allowed in the year the asset is disposed of.
The tax depreciation rates of fixed assets, as prescribed under the Income Tax Regulations, are as follows:
## Goodwill
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of goodwill. Generally, goodwill is regarded as capital of nature and is not deductible for corporate tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of start-up expenses. Generally, any operating expenses incurred before the commencement of business are not tax deductible. Myanmar tax authorities view pre-commencement expenses as capital in nature and not deductible for tax purposes. Capital expenditures incurred prior to the commencement of business should be allowed for tax depreciation where they relate to qualifying fixed assets.
## Interest expenses
There is currently no specific provision in the Myanmar Income Tax Law indicating the tax treatment of interest expenses. In current practice, interest expenses and the related financing costs are likely deductible only in the year these expenses are incurred, provided that the interest expenses incurred are meeting the tax deductibility rules above and commensurate with the volume of business or benefits that the taxpayer received.
## Bad debt
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of bad debt.
## Charitable contributions
Deductible charitable donations are limited to those made to the approved charitable organisations/activities and are subject to an overall limitation of 25% of total income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not deductible as they are not incurred in the production of business income.
## Taxes
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of taxes paid.
## Net operating losses
### Ordinary losses
Losses from any source may be set off against income accruing from any other sources in that year, except where the loss is from capital assets or a share of loss from an association of persons. Losses that are not fully deducted in a year can be carried forward and set off against profits in the next three consecutive years.
There is no provision for the carrying back of losses.
### Capital losses
Capital losses and a share of loss from an association of persons cannot be set off against income from other sources or carried forward.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Myanmar corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to affiliates, provided that these payments are commensurate with the volume of business.

There is no group taxation regime in Myanmar.
## Transfer pricing regime
There are currently no transfer pricing rules in Myanmar.
## Thin capitalisation rules
Generally, there is currently no specific safe harbour with respect to a debt-to-equity ratio for Myanmar tax purposes. The Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) has set a maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 (as part of the criteria for a Myanmar entity to obtain a foreign loan).
## Controlled foreign company (CFC) regime
There are currently no CFC rules in Myanmar.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Generally, foreign branches are deemed to be non-resident companies. Non-resident companies are taxed only on income derived from sources within Myanmar. Non-resident companies pay tax at the same rate as resident companies. This means a branch of a foreign company will pay tax at the 22% rate. The income is generally subject to tax under the normal rules for residents.

3. The Commission may allow more favourable exemptions and reliefs for locations where Myanmar citizen-owned businesses are operated. The government may also provide subsidies, funding, capacity building, and training to Myanmar citizen investors and citizen-owned small and medium-sized enterprises.
4.

7. If the volume of investment is increased and the original investment business is expanded during the period of investment, exemption or relief from customs duties or other internal taxes or both on machineries, equipment, instruments, machinery components, spare parts, materials used in the business, and construction materials not available locally, which are imported as they are actually required for use in the business that is being expanded.
8. Exemption or relief from income tax if the profits obtained from the investment business is reinvested in the same business or in a similar type of investment business within one year.

11. Foreign investors will pay income tax at the rates applicable to citizens residing within the country.
## Union of Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (MFIL) incentives

Foreigners who reside in Myanmar for at least 183 days during an income year are considered resident foreigners.
Foreigners who reside in Myanmar for less than 183 days during an income year are considered non-resident foreigners, unless they are working for MFIL/MIL companies, in which case they could be treated as resident foreigners, regardless of their period of stay in Myanmar, under the relevant tax incentive that may be granted to the MFIL/MIL companies.
