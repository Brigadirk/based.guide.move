# Albania
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Taxable period
Albania’s tax year is the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
## Tax returns
Tax resident individuals in Albania who generate income sourced not only in Albania but also from other countries and non-residents who generate income sourced in Albania are required to submit an annual income declaration to the central tax administration.
A tax resident individual is obliged to submit an annual PIT return when:
Individuals are required to submit an annual income declaration at the central tax administration not later than 31 March of the year following the tax period for which the declaration is made.
Every natural person (self-employed or trader individual) who carries out economic activity is obliged to submit the annual tax return for business income within the deadline above.
## Payment of tax
Employers are required to withhold PIT for salaries and other compensations related to current employment.
Whereas the declaration is made on an annual basis, the taxpayer has the obligation to pay the respective tax to the tax authorities by the 20th day of the month following the month when the income was received.
The tax paid during the year will be deducted from the amount of tax calculated. In the event that the individual declaration results in tax liability, the individual should make the payment of the tax due not later than 31 March of the year following the tax period for which the declaration is made.

# Albania
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 20%, and the standard VAT period is the calendar month.
Taxable transactions include goods and services supplied domestically as well as goods imported into Albania by a taxable person. The following transactions are also taxable:
### Determination of VAT payers
‘Taxable person’ shall mean any person who, despite the legal form of organisation, independently carries out any economic activity, whatever the place and the purpose or results of that activity.
The VAT registration threshold in Albania is annual turnover over ALL 10 million. Any person providing taxable supplies and whose annual turnover does not exceed ALL 10 million is not required to register, although voluntary registration is possible.
### VAT obligations for non-resident entities
For a non-taxable person, the place of supply shall be in Albania if the supplier of the non-taxable person has established their business or a fixed establishment there.
For a taxable person, the place of supply of services shall be in Albania if the taxable person who receives the service has established their business or a fixed establishment there.
### Reduced VAT rate
The reduced VAT rate of 6% is applied to the following:
The reduced VAT rate of 10 % is applied for the supply of agricultural inputs, including chemical fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, and seedlings.
### Zero-rated goods and services
The following goods and services are subject to 0% VAT in Albania:
### VAT-exempt goods and services
The VAT Law provides a list of supplies that are considered as VAT-exempt:
### VAT calculation
The amount of VAT to be paid is calculated as the difference between the VAT applied to purchases (input VAT) and the VAT applied to sales (output VAT). If the input is higher than the output, then the difference is a VAT credit that can be carried forward to subsequent months. Otherwise, if the output VAT is higher than the input VAT, the difference represents VAT payable to the state.
Taxpayers who carry out taxable VAT activities, as well as VAT-exempt activities, can credit only that portion of their input VAT that corresponds to the taxable activities. To determine the amount of input VAT that can be claimed from the state, the taxpayer should estimate a VAT credit coefficient (i.e. the rate of the taxable VAT activities over total activities).
### VAT reimbursement
Taxable entities have the right to claim VAT reimbursement if the period in which VAT credits are carried forward exceeds three consecutive months and the total amount of accumulated VAT credit is equal to or above ALL 400,000.
Following the request for VAT reimbursement, taxable entities have the right to obtain the reimbursement of VAT credit within 60 days after the request is submitted. For all taxable persons who are considered as exporters based on the criteria established by the Instruction of Council of Ministers, the deadline for tax authority approval, or not, of VAT reimbursement requests is within 30 days.
### VAT returns
The submission of VAT returns and sales and purchase books must be done electronically by all taxpayers, including VAT representatives.
Electronic submission deadlines fall on the dates below:
## Customs duties
Albania uses the Harmonized Code System for tariff classification.
The customs duty rates range from 0% to 15%, depending on the type of goods.
Import of machinery and equipment for use in the taxpayer's business activity are generally subject to customs duties at the zero rate.
Import of vehicles are subject to customs duties at a rate of 0%.
## Excise duties
Excise duty is a tax applicable to certain goods consumed in Albania, whether imported or produced in the country.
Albanian excise legislation is based on EU Council Directive 2008/118/EC, which defines common provisions applicable for all excisable goods. It also integrates specific provisions applicable for each category of excise products.
Categories of products subject to excise duty in Albania are:
Excise duty is usually calculated as an amount per quantitative measuring unit defined for that product (e.g. per litre, per kilogram, per hectolitre, per 1,000 pieces).
Reimbursement of excise tax can be obtained on:
The reimbursement procedure is subject to special provisions and pre-defined criteria on the basis of which the amount to be reimbursed is calculated.
## Real estate tax
Entities that own real estate property in Albania are subject to real estate tax.
### Real estate tax on buildings
Real estate tax on buildings is calculated based on the type of activity the business entity owning the building carries out. The basis for this tax is the value of the building.
Tax due is calculated on a yearly basis as a percentage of the value of the building, depending on the use of the latter, as outlined below:
| Type of building | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I. | Residential buildings | 0.05 |
| II. | Buildings used for commercial purposes | 0.20 |
| III. | Construction sites for which building has not been finalised within the deadline outlined in the construction permit | 30.00 \* |
\* The tax rate for construction sites not yet finalised is 30% of the corresponding tax rate for the entire construction area, for which the developer has been provided with a construction permit and has not managed to complete it according to the deadline defined in the act of approving the request for a construction permit.
### Real estate tax on agricultural land
Real estate tax on agricultural land is levied on each hectare and varies depending on the district where the agricultural land is located and on the land productivity categorisation.
### Real estate tax on land (non-agricultural)
Real estate tax on land (non-agricultural) is levied per square metre and varies depending on the district where the land is located.
## Stamp duties and notary taxes
There are no stamp duties on the sale contract of land or other properties. There are, however, notary taxes that are, in nature, similar to stamp duties. The notary tax on sales contracts that relate to change in ownership of immovable properties is ALL 1,000. The notary tax on sales contracts that relate to change in ownership of movable properties is ALL 700.
Depending on the agreement reached between the seller and the buyer, the notary tax can be paid either by the seller, or by the buyer, or shared between both of them.
## Registration taxes
The fee for the registration of a business entity is ALL 120; however, it can be reduced to ALL 0 if the registration is made online.
## Payroll-related taxes
Entities shall withhold personal income tax (PIT) from the gross salaries of their employees.
## Social and health contributions (SHC)
Employers shall pay SHC to the tax authorities at a rate of 15% and 1.7%, respectively. The social contributions are paid between the minimum and maximum gross salary for SHC purposes, which are ALL 40,000 from 1 April 2023 (previously ALL 34,000) and ALL 176,416 from 1 April 2023 (previously ALL 149,953), respectively. The health contributions are calculated on the total gross salary.

# Albania
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The final CIT return is due by 31 March of the year following the tax year.
## Payment of tax
Predetermined advance payments of CIT are due either by the 15th day of each month or by the end of each quarter.
According to the tax laws, CIT is paid during the year on a prepayment basis. The amount of monthly CIT prepayments is determined as follows:
The final due date for the payment of the final CIT for a fiscal year is 31 March of the following year. Note that this payment is calculated as the total amount of CIT self-assessed from the taxpayer for that particular fiscal year less total CIT instalments paid related to that year.
Penalties for non-compliance with CIT prepayment deadlines are 10% of the unpaid liability.
Companies have the obligation to pay the non-resident WHT on dividends to the tax authorities no later than 20 August of the year the financial results are approved, regardless of the fact of whether the dividend has been distributed or not to the shareholders.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the Albanian tax system is based on self-assessment, which is under continuous audit by the tax authorities. Such audits include all types of taxes that the business is subject to. If any discrepancies result from the tax audit, the tax authorities issue an assessment notice, which the taxpayer might appeal within 30 calendar days.
Taxpayers may submit a corrected declaration within 36 months from the submission of the initial declaration, provided that this declaration has not been previously inspected by the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
With regard to Albania's tax administration practices, the statute of limitations of a tax audit is five years. However, the statute of limitations can be extended by 30 calendar days in cases where:
The right of the taxpayer to submit a reimbursement request is limited to five years from the moment that the credit position is confirmed.
During a tax audit, the main focus of the tax authorities is on areas related to transfer pricing, which is becoming an increasing area of focus; WHT; and aspects affecting CIT, such as expense deductibility.
## Tax Certificates
If a taxpayer’s financial statements and tax declarations are certified as compliant with the tax legislation by certified auditing companies, the tax administration will include this as a parameter in the taxpayer risk analysis for tax inspection purposes.

# Albania
## Overview
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Albania is located in Southeast Europe, in the west of the Balkans, and shares common borders with Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south, and Kosovo and Montenegro to the north. It has access to the Adriatic and Ionian Seas in the west and southwest, being less than 72 kilometres away from Italy, across the Adriatic Sea.
Albania covers an area of 28,748 square kilometres and has a population of 2,862,000, with a density of 100.4 per square kilometre.
Albania is a parliamentary republic. The system of government is based on the separation and balancing of the legislative, executive, and judicial powers.
The official language of the Republic of Albania is Albanian, and the official currency is the lek (ALL). The capital of Albania is Tirana.
Albania’s economy has been improving in the last couple of years, with the gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at a steady rate. In 2019, the GDP real growth rate was 2.9%, after expanding 4.145% during 2018 according to the Word Bank. Growth is projected to accelerate slightly to 3.4% to 3.6% by 2020/21, as labour income gains fuel private consumption, based on World Bank projections.
Albania is currently pursuing a path of greater Euro-Atlantic integration. Its primary long-term goals are to gain European Union (EU) membership and to promote closer bilateral ties with its neighbours, the EU countries, and with the United States. Albania is a member of a number of international organisations, as well as multiple regional organisations and initiatives, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations (UN), the Stability Pact, the Adriatic Charter, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). In June 2006, Albania and the European Union signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step to EU membership, which focuses on implementing essential rule of law reforms and curbing corruption and organised crime.
Albania is a party to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). The 2006 Interim Agreement on Free Trade between Albania and the European Union ensures benefits for the Albanian economy by expanding the markets for Albanian products with preferential treatment.

# Albania
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the end of each tax period using the methods stipulated in the Accounting Law, which should be applied systematically. The methods stipulated in the National Accounting Standards for the valuation of inventory at year-end are the average cost and first in first out (FIFO) methods. The accounting method of inventory evaluation cannot be changed more than once in five years.
## Capital gains
Generally, capital gains tax (CGT) is not distinct from CIT, and any capital gain is taxed as CIT at the 15% CIT rate. The capital gain is derived from the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the asset (or the nominal value).
Capital gains, if any, are added to the taxable profit of the company and are taxed together with those profits at the 15% CIT rate. If the seller is a tax resident in a country other than Albania, based on applicable DTTs, the capital gain on sale of shares is generally taxed in the country in which the seller is resident, subject to certain provisions under domestic law and tax treaties.
Changes in the ownership of companies operating in the telecommunication sector, the hydrocarbon/mineral asset exploitation sector, and the financial sector in Albania are taxed in Albania as per the local legislation, and companies should inform the tax authorities within 45 days of the transaction.
Note that the above applies in cases when the Albanian entity has realised an average turnover of ALL 500 million for three consecutive previous years.
The Albanian entity subject to ownership changes is expected to notify the tax authorities regarding the details of the change within 45 days from the moment the ownership change occurred.
The obligation to notify does not apply if the sale of shares results in less than a 10% change in ownership of the Albanian company.
## Dividend income
Dividends and other profit distributions received by a resident entity from another resident entity or from a non-resident entity are not subject to CIT for the resident beneficiary of such income. This applies under two conditions: (i) the shareholding is greater than 10% and (ii) the shares have been held for a continuous period of at least 24 months.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed at the rate of 15%.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed as ordinary income, at the rate of 15%.
## Foreign income
Albanian resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. If a DTT is in force, double taxation is avoided either through an exemption or by granting a tax credit up to the amount of the applicable Albanian CIT rate.
Albanian legislation does not contain any provisions under which income earned abroad may be tax deferred.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
The gross amount of interest and royalties paid to non-resident companies is subject to a 15% tax rate, while dividends and distribution of profits are taxed at a rate of 8%, unless a DTT provides a different rate.
The 15% tax rate is levied on the gross amount of payments for technical, management, installation, assembly, or supervisory work, as well as payments to management and board members.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
Albania has signed 46 DTTs, of which 42 are in force.

Notes
These notes are not extensive. The full text of the DTT should be reviewed for a comprehensive check on the conditions of application of the reduced rates.
1. If the recipient company directly or indirectly owns 50% of the capital of the paying company, a 0% rate of the gross amount of the dividends applies.

# Albania
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Based on Albanian legislation, a legal entity is deemed to be resident in Albania if it has its head office or its place of effective management in Albania.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
PE in Albania means a fixed place of business where an entity carries out, wholly or partly, its business activities, including, but not limited to, an administration office, a branch, a factory, a workshop, a mine, and a construction or installation site, as well as the performing of services (including consulting services) through the employees or other individuals for a period of six months or more in the Republic of Albania.
An entity that operates in the insurance field of another country, excluding reinsurance activity, will be considered to have a PE in the Republic of Albania if through another person collects premiums in the Republic of Albania or insures risks located in the Republic of Albania.
The determination of a PE, where applicable, is based on the provisions of the double tax treaties (DTTs) that Albania has entered into with a number of countries. When dealing with DTT provisions, the Albanian tax authorities refer to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) commentaries.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Allowed tax depreciation and amortisation rates and methods for each category of fixed assets are shown below:
| Asset category | Method | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buildings and machinery and other fixed structures installed in the building | Straight-line basis | 5 |
| Computers, software products, and information systems | Straight-line basis | 25 |
| Other assets | Straight-line basis | 20 |
| Intangible assets (including goodwill and start-up expenses) | Straight-line basis | 15 |
Notes
Depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets at amounts higher than those allowed for tax purposes is considered a non-deductible expense.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid in excess of the average 12-month credit interest rate applied in the banking system, as determined by the Bank of Albania, is a non-deductible expense.
Additional to the above, any interest expenses that take at least 30% or more of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) are recognised as non-deductible for CIT purposes. Interest for which the deduction is denied is carried forward for the next five years.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are only deductible if the following conditions are met simultaneously:
This applies to all entities except those operating in the financial sector.
## Charitable contributions
There are no provisions in Albania regarding the tax treatment of charitable contributions. In general, contributions are considered as non-deductible expenses for CIT purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and other tax-related sanctions are non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Income taxes, VAT, and excise duties are non-deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
The Albanian legislation also defines the following specific costs as non-deductible:
The amounts allocated to special reserve accounts in banks and insurance companies that are calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are deductible.
In the case of banks, branches of foreign banks, and non-bank financial entities licensed by the Bank of Albania for the exercise of lending activity, the write-off of bad debt is recognised as a deductible expense if the following conditions are met:
Employers’ contributions towards the life and health insurance of employees are deductible.
## Net operating fiscal losses
Fiscal losses may be carried forward up to five consecutive years. However, losses may not be carried forward if more than 50% ownership of the share capital or voting rights of the company is transferred during the tax year, provided that this is accompanied by a change of business activity.
Albanian legislation does not allow losses to be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are subject to withholding tax (WHT) unless tax relief is requested in accordance with the local legislation or any DTT in place. These payments are tax deductible if they are properly documented and incurred for business purposes only.
Payments to foreign affiliates made for the purpose of profit transfer might be subject to price revaluation by the tax authorities. Any transactions/payments made to foreign affiliates shall be performed on an arm’s-length basis.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
There is no group taxation in Albania.
## Transfer pricing
The law on transfer pricing in Albania emphasises the following:
- one person participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of the other person, and
- the same person or persons participate(s), directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of both persons.
The taxpayer subject to transfer pricing rules must have in place the following information:
Taxpayers with a total value of related-party transactions of over 30 million euros (EUR) for the period of the agreement, can enter into an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) with the tax authority.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is a CFC rule in Albania, introduced with Law No. 29/2023 'On Income Tax', applicable to natural persons only. According to this law, when a natural person has an interest in a controlled foreign entity, the profits of which are not subject to tax or are exempt from tax in the Republic of Albania, any undistributed profits, which derive from passive income, must to be included in the taxable income from the investment of the natural person, provided that this passive income exceeds 30% of the total profit of the controlled foreign entity.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
Taxable income of the individual (subject to PIT) is composed of three categories:
Income is taxable regardless of whether it is paid in cash or in kind. Income in kind is assessed at the market value, as far as it is not defined otherwise in this law or in the by-laws issued in its implementation.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale of shares are taxable at rate of 15%. The taxable base is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the shares (or the nominal value).
The transfer of ownership of real estate, either land or buildings, is subject to 15% tax on the capital gain realised from the sale transaction.
## Partnership income
Partnerships are treated as separate taxable persons, which mean that an individual participating in more than one partnership should report separately for each of the partnerships they participate in.
## Exempt income
The following incomes are exempt when determining taxable income for PIT purposes:
