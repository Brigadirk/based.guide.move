## WHT on small-size businesses
A 2% WHT is applicable to the remunerations paid to business service providers registered under enterprising tax regime (*régime de l'entreprenant*) or micro-enterprise tax regime.
A 5% WHT is applicable to payments made by government bodies or public institutions for a contract for services (or goods) to a business subject to the enterprising tax regime or micro-enterprise tax regime.
A 2% WHT is applicable to payments made to service providers operating in the informal sector by persons subject to an effective tax regime.
## WHT on writers’ revenue
A 7.5% WHT applies to occasional revenue paid to individuals or companies as royalties on books, scientific studies, and artistic productions.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
The Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), which became independent in 1960, is located on the south coast of West Africa. It is divided into 14 districts (including two autonomous Districts) and 31 regions, with Yamoussoukro as the capital. The official language of Côte d'Ivoire is French, and the currency is the *Communauté financière d'Afrique* (Financial Community of Africa or CFA) franc (XOF).
Côte d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans and a significant producer and exporter of coffee, palm oil, and cashew nuts. Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for these commodities, and, to a lesser extent, to climatic conditions. Despite government attempts to diversify the economy, it is still dependent on agriculture and related activities that employ about 68% of the population.
Since 2006, oil and gas production have become more important engines of economic activity than cocoa. Offshore oil and gas production have resulted in substantial crude oil exports and provide sufficient natural gas to fuel electricity exports to Ghana, Togo, Benin, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Oil exploration by a number of consortiums of private companies continues offshore.
Oil production has been failing, and the government has launched an ambitious exploration program to end the slump and rapidly increase production to a target of 200,000 barrels per day. Several new blocs have been auctioned at the end of 2017 and in 2018.
In 2017, in a bid to catch up on demand and optimise regional opportunities, Côte d'Ivoire allocated 4 billion United States dollars (USD) for investment in the energy sector.
The government is encouraging the private sector to help ramp up electricity production in line with its ambition to increase capacity to 4,000 MW by 2020, up from around 1,600 MW in 2013.
Gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the last few years has also been driven by a significant increase in infrastructure investments (roads, bridges, public buildings, etc.) all over the country.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is generally stated at the lower of cost or market value. Last in first out (LIFO) and first in first out (FIFO) methods are permitted. Book and tax conformity is required.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are normally taxed at full corporate rates. However, the tax on capital gains, exclusive of recaptured depreciation, can be deferred if the gain is reinvested within three years.
Capital gains from direct sales of shares are subject to IRVM (i.e. securities income tax).
## Dividend income
Dividends are brought into taxable income at 50% of the net amount earned by the company (after 15% WHT).
The exemption is increased to 95% for dividends received from a subsidiary if a parent company domiciled in Côte d’Ivoire owns 10% of the subsidiary.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are unusual, but in the event they are declared, they are not taxable to the recipient.
## Interest income
Interest from loans is brought into taxable income at 50% of the net amount earned by the company (after 18% WHT).
## Royalty income
Royalty income received by a local taxpayer is included in its annual revenue and subject to corporate income tax (CIT).
Royalty income paid by a local taxpayer to a non-resident is subject to a 20% WHT, subject to the existence of a DTT between Côte d’Ivoire and the country of the effective recipient of the royalties.
Most DTTs will provide a reduced rate of 10% or 5% for WHT on royalties.
Royalties are defined by tax treaties.
In the absence of a DTT, the 20% WHT applies to all services payments to non-residents, including royalties.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income, except for profits derived from business conducted through a PE outside Côte d’Ivoire. Since income derived from business conducted outside Côte d’Ivoire is not taxable, no tax credit is allowed.
Interest and dividends from foreign sources are entitled to certain deductions to alleviate instances of double taxation. Subject to provisions of tax treaties, no deductions or tax credits are allowed for revenue from royalties and services.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a non-cumulative tax levied on the sale of goods and services at the rate of 18%. Subject to certain restrictions, VAT is recoverable.
The rate is reduced to 9% for milk (excepted yogurt and other dairy products), infants milk and homogenised and composite preparation foods for infants, luxury rice, meat imported outside the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and pasta products that contain 100% durum wheat semolina.
Equipment designed for the production of solar energy, previously subject to the reduced rate, is now exempt from VAT as part of the measures in favour of the preservation of environmental resources taken under article 18 of the 2024 Tax Annex (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](ivory-coast/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
## Customs duties
Customs duties rates range from 0% to 35%, depending on the classification of the imported goods according to the customs tariff.
Upon import, goods are also subject to the statistical duty (1%), to the community solidarity levy (0.8%), to African Union import tax (0.2%), to community levy (0.5%), and to VAT (18%).
Special taxes, depending on the nature of the imported goods, may apply, such as excise duties.
The economic partnership agreement between Côte d’Ivoire and the European Union (EU) for customs tariffs dismantling is effective since January 2019.
According to this economic agreement, the products from the European Union covered by the tariff lines concerned are duties free when imported in Côte d’Ivoire.
The exemption only concerns the customs duties, excepting the community levies, statistical duty, and domestic consumption taxes due on importations.
### Statistical duty
The statistical duty is levied together with the customs duties during the customs clearance procedures of imported goods.
The rate of the statistical duty is 1% on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the imported goods.
### Community levy
The community levy is due together with the customs duties during the customs clearance procedures of imported goods.
The rate of the ECOWAS community levy is 0.5% on the CIF value of the imported goods.
Products imported from outside the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) remain subject to the community levy at 0.8% for five years from January 2015.
The community levy does not apply to goods imported from member countries of the WAEMU, which includes Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali, Benin, Togo, Niger, and Bissau Guinea.
### African Union import duty
A duty called the African Union import tax applies on imports of items outside the African Union at the rate of 0.2%.
## Excise duties
Excise duties apply on cigarette imports, alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages, and oil products.
Excise duties on tobacco are extended by the FY22 Financial Law to electronic cigarettes, pipes and their parts, preparations for pipes, and products and materials for shisha and electronic cigarettes. Under the FY24 Financial Law, the rate was raised from 41% to 42%.
The FY19 Financial Law has extended excise duties (10%) to tourism vehicles with at least 13 horsepower.
Under the FY21 Financial Law, excise duties (10% or 50%) are applied to perfume and cosmetic products. The 50% rate has been reduced to 15% under the 2022 tax schedule.
## Real estate tax
A real estate tax is imposed at the following rates:
## Transfer taxes
In the case of the transfer of property through a direct sale, taxes are assessed at the following rates:
For mortgages, the rate is 5% for the financial lessor at the acquisition of the good and 1% for acquisition of the immovable property by the lessee from the exercise of the option.
## Stamp duty
A direct tax is paid for any document subject to a registration procedure, for an acknowledgement of a cash payment, and for bills of exchange.
Current account agreements are subject to a proportional stamp duty.
## Payroll taxes
Taxes are levied at the rates of 2.8% for local employees and 12% for expatriate employees on the total taxable remuneration, including salaries, benefits, and benefits in kind.
With the removal of the 20% reduction on gross remuneration paid, as part of the salary tax reform, the above-mentioned usage rates are directly applied to the gross base for the calculation of the employer contribution.
## Social security contributions
Employers must contribute to the social security system (CNPS) at the following rates:
| Contribution | Contribution rate (%) | Monthly ceiling (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Family allowance | 5.75 | 70,000 |
| Work injury | 2.0 to 5.0 | 70,000 |
| Retirement pension | 7.7 | 3,375,000 |
## Special tax for equipment
A special tax is paid by all taxpayers for the purpose of the equipment of the government. The tax is calculated on 0.1% of total turnover and is paid monthly. This tax, which was originally scheduled to end on 31 December 2019, is now a permanent tax since the FY20 Financial Law.
## Business franchise tax
The business franchise tax includes a turnover tax and a proportional tax. The turnover tax is calculated on turnover at the rate of 0.5%, with a minimum tax of XOF 300,000 and a maximum tax of XOF 3 million. The proportional tax rate is 18.5% and is based on the rental value of the professional office location (based on general office rents).
## Tax on banking operations
A cumulative tax of 10% is levied on bank services rendered. Tax on banking operations charged by banks to companies is fully deductible from output VAT.
## Registration taxes
Registration of capital contributions is taxed, whether the capital contribution or increase in capital is made in cash or in kind. The rate is 0.3% for contributions exceeding XOF 10 million to XOF 5 billion and 0.1% for contributions over XOF 5 billion, with a minimum tax of XOF 18,000. Increases in capital by incorporation of reserves are taxed at 6%.
In the event of a capital increase through a merger, the increase in the share capital of the acquiring company is taxed at half of the rates above.
The transfer of shares held in a company located in Côte d'Ivoire is liable to a 1% registration duty on the sale price or market value of the shares when the transfer does not trigger the disappearance of the company or the creation a new legal entity.
## Tax on insurance premiums
Insurance premiums are subject to tax as follows:
| Policy type | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Marine policies | 7.0 |
| Life policies | Exempted when contract’s duration is more than three years |
| Fire policies | 25.0 |
| Health policies | 8.0 |
| Export credit insurance | 0.1 |
| Other (e.g. personal liability, transportation) | 14.5 |
Premiums paid under commercial shipping insurance policies for maritime risks are exempt. The tax may be paid by the insurance company, its agent, or the subscriber in cases where the subscriber had to pay the premium to a foreign insurance company.
The insurance tax rates are reduced by half for insurance of religious buildings.
The above rates are also halved for microinsurance contracts under the FY22 Financial Law.
## Tax on telecommunication companies
A specific tax of 5% is applicable on the turnover of mobile telecommunication, information technology, and communication companies.
Companies renting passive infrastructures and telecom towers to telecom companies are not within the scope of this tax.
The FY19 Financial Law has extended the application of this tax to money transfer companies via mobile networks.
Companies operating in the telecommunication, information technology, and communication sector must also invest 20% of the amount of dividends transferred abroad in bonds of the public Treasury or any borrowing instrument issued by the government of Côte d'Ivoire.
## Tax on telecommunication services
A special tax of 3% is applicable on telecommunication services provided to the public. The tax is invoiced and collected by companies operating mobile or land telecommunication and Internet services in Côte d'Ivoire.
## Surtax on rent
A special tax of 300% is applicable to the amount of rent on accommodation or professional premises that exceeds the two-month guarantee and one-month upfront payment at the beginning of the lease. The special tax is borne by the lessor.
## Tax on audiovisual communication
The 2022 tax annex established a tax on audiovisual communication. The tax is due on advertising messages from non-resident companies that broadcast them.
The scope of the tax on audiovisual communication is reserved solely for advertisements broadcast by foreign channels belonging to the same group of companies as the operator installed in Côte d’Ivoire that distributes it. It is therefore irrelevant whether this link is direct or indirect.
The tax is payable by companies of the same group that broadcast in Côte d'Ivoire, whatever the means, advertising through television or radio channels of companies not resident in Côte d'Ivoire. The rate of the tax is set at XOF 20,000 per hour or fraction of an hour of advertising broadcast.
## Environmental tax and annual environmental fee
The 2024 Tax Annex established environmental tax and annual environmental fee on classified establishments, in accordance with the Water Charter and its annexes, adopted 2008 by the member states of the Niger Basin Authority, including Côte d'Ivoire.
Classified establishments are defined as any installation presenting dangers or disadvantages either for public safety or health, or for the environment or public health, as well as the conservation of sites and monuments.
### Environmental tax
The environmental tax is paid by any classified establishment during its opening. The tax rate, determined at the rate of the surface area occupied by the establishment classified, is established as follows:
### Annual environmental fee
The amount collected as the annual environmental fee amounts to XOF 3,000 per classified establishment.

Taxpayers with a turnover between XOF 5 million and XOF 50 million are taxed under the *taxe d'Etat de l'entreprenant* and are required to produce electronic, as well as paper, financial statements.
The micro-enterprise scheme is a tax scheme related to taxpayers with turnover between XOF 50 million and XOF 200 million. Micro-enterprises with turnover of at least XOF 100 million can opt for the simplified real taxation scheme or non-commercial income tax regime.
The simplified real taxation scheme (*Réel simplifié d'imposition*) applies to taxpayers with turnover ranging from XOF 200 million to XOF 500 million. Under the simplified real taxation scheme, annual financial statements have a lighter presentation.
The real taxation scheme applies to taxpayers with a turnover above XOF 500 million.
Financial statements are filed annually, according to local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
## Payment of tax
Payment of CIT is made in three instalments in April, June, and September following the end of the fiscal year, depending on the sector of activity and taxpayer's office, as follows:
## Tax audit process
Many types of tax audits are available to the tax administration, which may request any accounting-related document for the purpose of tax audit.
The most common is the general tax audit of the taxpayer’s situation, which covers the statute of limitation period. It is carried out with a notice at least five days before the beginning of the audit. The audit is carried out on the premises of the taxpayer for a maximum of six months (with a possibility to extend for a period of three additional months), and a primary tax assessment is issued.
The taxpayer then has 30 days to agree or challenge the assessment, and the definitive assessment is issued within a maximum of three months following the primary tax assessment notification date.
The definitive tax assessment has to be issued within a maximum of two months for taxpayers with annual turnover up to XOF 500 million.
The Tax Annex to the 2023 Finance Law instituted an obligation to digitise tax audits. This obligation to digitise tax audits only concerns the adversarial procedure in the context of in-depth verification of the overall tax situation (VASFE) or accounting checks. The exchange of documents by electronic means between the tax administration and the taxpayers is now mandatory.
Further challenge of the definitive assessment is possible before the head of the tax administration and the court.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations covers the current year and the three prior years.
The tax administration generally focuses on compliance with the CIT filing deadline and on the payment of the instalments.
For consistency of the tax returns, the tax administration focuses on the filing of the additional records (Annual Financial Statements, Etat 301: Annual Salary Statement, Etat 302: Annual Fees Statement), records of the provisions, tax losses, and amortisations carried forward.
During tax audits, the focus is on transactions with non-resident related parties.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
The Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) taxes residents on their worldwide income.
Individuals resident in Côte d’Ivoire are subject to specific direct income tax, depending on the kind of revenue earned.
## Personal income tax rates
### Tax on salaries and wages
Taxes on salaries and wages, pensions, and life annuities payable by employees have been reformed through Ordinance No. 2023-718 of 13 September 2023. The broad outlines of these reforms are as follows:
### Progressive tax scale by salary bracket
The tax on salaries and wages is now calculated on the gross amount of the salary and according to a monthly progressive scale per bracket to which a determined rate is applied. This scale allows the gross tax to be calculated as follows:
| Monthly income brackets (XOF\*) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 75,000 | 0 |
| 75,000 | 240,000 | 16 |
| 240,000 | 800,000 | 21 |
| 800,000 | 2,400,000 | 24 |
| 2,400,000 | 8,000,000 | 28 |
| 8,000,000 |  | 32 |
The formula to apply to directly obtain the amount of the monthly gross tax is as follows:
R = Taxable income
| Taxable monthly salary bracket (XOF) | Gross tax amount |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 75,000 | 0 |
| 75,001 to 240,000 | R x 16% - 12,000 |
| 240,001 to 800,000 | R x 21% - 24,000 |
| 800,001 to 2,400,000 | R x 24% - 48,000 |
| 2,400,001 to 8,000,000 | R x 28% - 144,000 |
| Above 8,000,000 | R x 32% - 464,000 |

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period in Côte d’Ivoire is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Employers must calculate and withhold taxes due by employees, and they must file monthly returns for both employee tax and the employer’s payroll tax. Adjustment declarations are filed annually by 30 June for companies subject to audit requirements and 30 May for the others.
Employees are not required to file and pay the payroll tax when their employer is not in the country.
A husband and wife are taxed separately. The husband’s salary is taxed with regard to the relevant tax reduction for dependants (marriage and children). Employed women are also taxed with regard to the same deductions for dependants (marriage and children) as their husbands'.
## Payment of tax
Taxes, including withholding taxes (WHTs), are remitted by the entities registered with the *’Direction des Grandes Entreprises*’ and '*Direction des Moyennes Entreprises'* of the Tax Administration by the 10th day of each month for the preceding month for industrial, mining, and oil companies, the 15th day of each month for sales companies, and the 20th day of each month for service providers. For entities registered with the other tax offices, the deadline is the 15th day of each month.
For very small size taxpayers (*taxe d'etat de l'entreprenant*), the filing and payment is due by the 10th day of each month.
The payment is due at the same date for small size taxpayers subject to the micro-enterprise tax regime (*régime de la microentreprise*).

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
Tax on industrial and commercial profits in Côte d’Ivoire is levied at 25%, subject to a minimum tax. The rate is 30% for companies in the telecommunication, information technology, and communication sectors.
Non-resident entities are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at 20%, subject to existing double tax treaties (DTTs), on their Côte d’Ivoire source income when they do not have a permanent establishment (PE). Non-residents with a PE are taxed in the same way as a resident.
## Minimum tax
The minimum tax is based on total turnover and is calculated at the rate of 0.5%, with a minimum tax of 3 million *Communauté financière d'Afrique* (Financial Community of Africa or CFA) francs (XOF) and a maximum tax of XOF 35 million.
The minimum tax will be due, even if tax on industrial and commercial profits owed is higher, if the cumulative amount of taxes due for the financial year, excluding third-party taxes, is lower than the maximum amount of micro-enterprise tax determined on the basis of the upper turnover threshold of the micro-enterprise tax regime.
## Local income taxes
The income tax is levied at the national level. There is no local income tax.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
In Côte d’Ivoire, companies are considered resident in tax jurisdictions where they have a registered fixed establishment (e.g. subsidiaries, branches, representative offices).
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A non-resident is considered as having a PE in Côte d’Ivoire when its activities involve a comprehensive commercial cycle in Côte d’Ivoire or when it operates through a dependent agent in Côte d’Ivoire.
According to DTTs, a non-resident is considered as having a PE in Côte d’Ivoire when it has a registered establishment, including a subsidiary, a branch, a representative office, a mine or an oil well, a building site, a manufacture plant, or a trading establishment. Sometimes, a time threshold of six months is considered.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset (e.g. 20 years for buildings, 3 years for automobiles). Accelerated depreciation is sometimes permitted for machinery. The following depreciation rates are generally accepted for tax purposes:
| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 5 |
| Machinery, equipment (rate depending on equipment) | 8/10/20 |
| Office furniture | 10 |
| Office equipment | 20 |
| Vehicles | 33.3 |
| Computing equipment | 20 to 50 |
A time coefficient is applied to the rate of depreciation to obtain the declining balance. Depreciation rates may be amended, but only after agreement with the tax authorities.
New plants and equipment may be depreciated at twice the normal rate in the first year of use, provided they are depreciated over at least six years. Under certain circumstances, buildings used for staff housing may be depreciated at 40% of cost in the first year. Annual depreciation must be booked to preserve tax deductibility. The whole or any part of the annual charge can then be deferred in annual accounts for fiscal years showing a tax loss. Recaptured depreciation is taxed at full rates. Tax and book conformity is obligatory.
Depletion allowances, as such, do not exist, but tax incentives are available for exploration to replace depleted natural reserves.
## Goodwill
Goodwill (capital gain) deriving from the transfer of assets is included in taxable profit. The gain may be exempt from the income tax basis if the taxpayer commits to reinvest the purchase price of the transferred assets plus the goodwill in the three following years.
If the reinvestment is not completed in the three years, the gain will be subject to income taxation.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses (e.g. legal fees, registration duties on share capital subscription, the costs of any registration procedure, advertisement expenses) have to be amortised over a period from two to five years.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to shareholders may be deducted. The deduction is limited to the interest on a loan where the amount of the loan does not exceed the company's share capital, even for local holding companies (FY19 Financial Law).
The maximum interest rate allowed is related to the *Banque Central des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest* (BCEAO) rate plus two points.
The reimbursement of the loan must take place in the five years following the loan.
Total interest must not exceed 30% of the company's pre-tax book income before interest, depreciation, and reserve.
The company's share capital must be paid out entirely.
## Bad debt
Provisions for bad debts are deductible, provided that a minimum set of collection procedures have been engaged.
Bad debts are deductible for income tax purposes unless the debt results from abnormal business decisions.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions to recognised sport and health associations are deductible.
Charitable contributions to individuals or non-recognised beneficiaries are not tax deductible.
Charitable contributions, in cash or in kind, to the state or local authorities for the purpose of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic are tax deductible.
Donations to the state and its branches as part of their actions in matters of public health and hygiene, as well as in the field of social actions, are tax deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines borne by corporations are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Regular taxes paid by corporations are deductible for income tax purposes.
Third party taxes (such as WHT on non-resident service providers) borne by corporations are not tax deductible.
## Other significant items
In respect to legal reserves, 10% of net profit must be transferred to a reserve for legal fees until the reserve equals 5% of the paid-up share capital.
To be tax deductible, provisions must relate to existing liability or loss. General reserves are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for five years.
Losses derived from depreciation can be carried forward indefinitely.
Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Reasonable royalties, interest, and management and service fees paid to foreign parent companies are tax deductible. However, the deductions should not exceed 5% of the turnover and 20% of the overhead. Otherwise, the portion exceeding the ceiling is not tax deductible. The onus is on the taxpayer to prove that expenses are justified and reflect real transactions.
Sums owed by the Ivorian company in return for an intra-group transaction that have remained unpaid for more than two years and without being subject to WHT on non-commercial profits and/or VAT on behalf of third parties are not deductible.
Where payments are made to a beneficiary located in a non-cooperative country or a tax-privileged country, deduction of sums paid is capped at 50% of their amounts. Non-cooperative and tax haven countries are those recorded on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) blacklist. Tax-privileged countries are defined as countries in which the due income tax amount is less than half of the income tax that would have been due on the same transaction in Côte d'Ivoire.
The excessive portion is added back to the CIT basis.
Deduction of expenses from group transactions is subject to the filing of a transfer pricing form. Failure to file the transfer pricing form results in the disallowing of the expenses. Filing of an incomplete or incorrect transfer pricing form results in a fine of XOF 2 million per error or omission.
CbC reporting is applicable when the group consolidated turnover threshold is met (i.e. XOF 250 billion).

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Côte d’Ivoire.
## Transfer pricing
Profits directly or indirectly transferred to related non-resident companies are disallowed from the income tax basis.
The tax administration may inquire on transfer pricing when local subsidiaries having most of their transactions with non-resident group companies record losses.
A transfer pricing report on group transactions must be filed together with annual financial statements, and the description of the method used by the taxpayer to determine its transfer prices must be expressly specified.
Since the 2023 Tax Annex law entered into force, the obligation to produce the master file and the local file is charged to Ivorian companies carrying out international intra-group transactions and coming under the management of large and medium-sized enterprises.
The master file-local file documentation must be produced and made available to the tax authorities on the date of the start of the verification of accounts, namely the date of the first intervention on place as shown on the tax notice.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
A CbC report must be filed when group consolidated turnover of XOF 250 billion is met.
## Thin capitalisation
When, because of losses, the equity of the company is less than 50% of the share capital, the company must be recapitalised in the two following years, unless the company is dissolved.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Côte d’Ivoire.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
The tax rate for branch income is the same as that for corporate income. After-tax branch earnings are subject to a 15% tax (*Impôt sur le revenu des valeurs mobilières* or IRVM) calculated on 50% of the taxable profit. This is analogous to the WHT on dividends.

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Since income derived from business conducted outside Côte d’Ivoire is not taxable, no tax credit is allowed.
## Investment Code
A new Investment Code was enforced in October 2018, the aim of which is to favour:
The Investment Code regimes involve the creation of three zones (A, B, and C), which will be defined by an Order issued by the government.
The duration for the granted tax benefit is:
The Investment Code includes two specific tax incentive regimes: the Investment Declaration Regime and the Investment Approval Regime. Both regimes apply to all economic activities, excluding finance and banking, non-industrial buildings builders, liberal activities (e.g. lawyer, notary), and commerce activities. However, investment related to the creation or the development of important shopping centres could qualify for the exemptions if certain conditions are met.
The new Code has also created priority economic sectors (Category 1), as opposed to non-priority economic sectors.
Category 1 includes:
Category 2 includes all other economic sectors (except those excluded from the benefit from the Investment Code) and hotel projects that do not reach the thresholds for Category 1.
A company eligible for Category 1 can take a definitive option for Category 2 when submitting one's demands for the investments approval regime in Category 1.
The Investment Declaration Regime has no minimum investment threshold, but has special requirements related to the activities of the company.
For the Investment Approval Regime, the minimum investment cost is:
The benefit from the Investment Code is granted by the Centre for the Promotion of Investments (named CEPICI), after an application is filed by the requestor.
During the investment period, the beneficiary enjoys the following:
After the completion of the investment, the beneficiary enjoys the following exemptions during a period that depends on the Category of activity and Zone the company is located in.
The investments companies approved for developing activities are not concerned by the below exemptions.
### Category 1
#### Zone A
#### Zone B
#### Zone C
### Category 2
Category 2 investments enjoy:
These incentives may not be combined with sector-specific investment programs, such as those for mining and hydrocarbons.
## Capital investment incentives
With prior approval of the tax authorities and varying with geographical location, 35% to 40% of the total investment in fixed assets related to commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity may be deducted from taxable income. The deduction is limited to 50% of taxable profits. The balance of deduction of the first year may be carried forward over the three following years.
The minimum investment threshold required to benefit from the tax reduction measure is XOF 100 million. This amount is reduced to XOF 25 million for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
## Tax credit for waste recycling business
A tax credit is granted to waste recycling business for the four years following the end of the investment.
This tax credit is equal to 10% of the investment amount but cannot exceed 50% of the taxable profits.
## Special incentive tax measures for investments in agro industry
Special incentive tax measures are granted for investments made in cashew and rubber processing under the approval investments regime of the Investment Code.
The specific incentive measures provide additional tax credits and exemptions regarding companies operating in Category 1.
## Tax credit for hiring and training
Tax credits are available for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large companies for hiring local individuals and interns for degree validation internships.
## Export incentives
No VAT is levied on export sales.
### Export incentives for the mining industry
In the exploration phase, mining subcontractors can benefit from the same import VAT and customs exemptions granted to mining title holders.
A tax on profit is levied as soon as investment funds are recovered. Mining enterprises may not combine these incentives with those of the Investment Code.
### Export incentives for petroleum service contractors
A special and optional tax treatment applies to petroleum service contractors that meet established criteria. The FY21 Financial Law provides for two rates as follows:
The above-mentioned rates are applicable on all tax-free turnover made in Côte d'Ivoire (FY22 Financial Law).
This optional simplified tax regime covers dividend tax and payroll tax.
CIT and the tax on insurance premiums are exempted.
Standard rates apply for business franchise tax and social security contributions for local personnel. The exemption from customs duties and VAT for oil companies is extended to petroleum service contractors.
## Favourable tax regime for investment companies with fixed capital
The 2022 tax schedule provides for a favourable tax regime for the benefit of fixed capital investment companies. This regime results in exemptions, particularly in terms of income tax and IRVM, for a period of 15 years from the date of creation of the company. They also benefit from exemptions on capital gains from the sale of securities as well as in terms of registration fees.
## Favourable tax measures for microinsurance companies
Microinsurance companies and operations have benefited from the following tax advantages since the entry into force of the 2022 tax schedule:
## Favourable tax measures for preserving environmental resources

# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Employment expenses
Deduction for employment expenses has been abolish by the reform of tax on salaries and wages and is replaced by the tax reduction measure for family expenses (*see below*).
## Personal deductions
Although the deduction of specific non-business expenses is permitted under tax law, the practice rarely is used since the results usually are less favourable than the result from taking the the tax reduction measure for family expenses (*see below*).
## Standard deductions
The standard deduction was removed under the reform of tax on salaries and wages.
## Personal allowances
### Tax reduction scale for dependants (RICF)
The reform of tax on salaries and wages provides for a tax reduction to take into account family responsibilities (RICF) to replace the family quotient system provided for by the previous device.
The tax reduction scale for dependants is as follows:
| Number of shares | Tax reduction scale for dependants (XOF monthly amount) |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 0 |
| 1.5 | 5,500 |
| 2.0 | 11,000 |
| 2.5 | 16,500 |
| 3.0 | 22,000 |
| 3.5 | 27,500 |
| 4.0 | 33,000 |
| 4.5 | 38,500 |
| 5.0 | 44,000 |
Retired people aged over 70 benefit from reduction of 75% of the calculated tax after application of the tax reduction for family responsibilities.
The number of shares to be taken into account for the determination of the tax reduction for family responsibilities is fixed as follows:
| Marital status | Number of shares |
| --- | --- |
| Single, divorced, or widower without dependent children | 1.0 |
| Married without dependent children | 2.0 |
| Single or divorced, having a dependent child | 2.0 |
| Married or widowed with a dependent child | 2.5 |
| Single or divorced, having two dependent children | 2.5 |
| Married or widowed with two dependent children | 3.0 |
| Single or divorced, having three dependent children | 3.0 |
| Married or widowed with three dependent children | 3.5 |
| Single or divorced, having four dependent children | 3.5 |
The number of shares is increased by one half point per dependent child. This increase is increased to one point per dependent minor or adult infirm.
However, the number of shares to take into consideration for the reduction of the tax may in no case exceed five.

Allowances for business expenses are not taxed up to an amount that equals 10% of taxable cash income plus reimbursements, provided their use is justified.
Food allowance up to XOF 30,000 per month per employee is not taxable.
Award allowances are not taxable up to the limit of six-months salary, excluding in-kind benefits.
There are no allowances for short-term residents.
