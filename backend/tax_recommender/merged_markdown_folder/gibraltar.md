## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Companies are subject to Gibraltar taxation on income accrued in and derived from Gibraltar.
The standard corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 15% (increasing from 12.5% with effect from 1 July 2024), with utility and energy providers and companies that abuse a dominant position paying a higher rate of 20%. For telecommunications companies, the 15% rate will apply to the gains and profits arising from their non-telecommunications business and activities.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Income tax is charged on income accruing in or derived from Gibraltar. The 'accrued in and derived from' principle is softened for individuals who carry out activities in Gibraltar for a period of less than 30 days in aggregate during the year of assessment, so that such individuals will be reimbursed for taxes paid on the income from their activities in Gibraltar.
Income tax is also charged on certain income accruing in, derived from, or received in any place other than Gibraltar by any person ordinarily resident in Gibraltar.
## Personal income tax rates
Individuals have the choice of being taxed under either an Allowances Based System or under a Gross Income Based System and will be assessed under the system that results in the lower tax.
### Allowances Based System
| Taxable income | Rate of tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| First GBP 4,000 | 14 |
| Next GBP 12,000 | 17 |
| Balance | 39 |
Persons whose taxable income does not exceed GBP 11,450 *per annum* are exempt from tax.
A tapering relief is available for individuals whose taxable income is between GBP 11,451 and GBP 19,500.
### Gross Income Based System
Under the Gross Income Based System, the applicable income bands and tax rates for the 2024/25 tax year are as follows for income up to GBP 25,000:
| Taxable income | Rate of tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| First GBP 10,000 | 6 |
| Next GBP 7,000 | 20 |
| Balance | 28 |
The income bands and tax rates for income above GBP 25,000 are:
| Taxable income | Rate of tax (%) (gross assessable income GBP 100,000 or less) |
| --- | --- |
| First GBP 17,000 | 16 |
| Next GBP 8,000 | 19 |
| Next GBP 15,000 | 25 |
| Next GBP 65,000 | 28 |
| Remainder of assessable income | 25 |
Persons under the Gross Income Based System may also benefit from a deduction from their assessable income (*see the [Deductions](gibraltar/individual/deductions.html) section*).

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period for individuals runs from 1 July, or the commencement of the source of income (if later), to 30 June in the year of assessment.
## Tax returns
Individuals are required to file returns and calculate their tax liability for the year. The return, together with the estimated liability, needs to be accompanied by payment of the tax due.
The due date for filing is 30 November. Individuals liable to tax or having assessable income for a year of assessment must make a full and complete return of their income for that year by 30 November immediately following the end of that year of assessment. Failure to submit a return by this date will result in a GBP 50 fine, which will increase by a further GBP 300 after three months.  If the failure continues beyond six months, an additional penalty of GBP 500 is payable.
## Payment of tax
For employees, the collection of tax is initially through a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. Every employer paying emoluments to an employee is required to deduct a specified amount of tax from the amount of emoluments.
At the end of the year of assessment, the employer is obligated to make a return of the employees' emoluments and tax deducted together with the payment of any outstanding tax.
Where the source of income is not collected under the PAYE system, individuals are required to make two payments on account, on 31 January and 30 June, in each year of assessment based on the previous year's assessment. Each payment should be equal to 50% of the previous year's tax payable. The balance of tax due (i.e. the actual liability less payments on account) is due on the date of filing of the return.
Late payment will result in a penalty of 10% of the amount of tax due. This will increase to 20% after a further 90 days.

# Gibraltar
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT in Gibraltar.
## Import duties
Goods imported into Gibraltar are subject to import duty at varying rates. The most noticeable exceptions are fuel, tobacco, and alcohol, which are subject to a fixed amount of duty regardless of the value, and motor vehicles, which attract duty at various rates of between 2% and 35% of the value, depending on the type and size of engine and whether it is a private or dealer importation.
## Excise taxes
There is no provision for excise taxes in Gibraltar.
## Property tax
A general business property rate is levied annually on all businesses in Gibraltar. The amount varies depending on the property and is subject to an annual review.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on the transfer or sale of any Gibraltar real estate or shares in a company owning Gibraltar real estate (on an amount based on the market value of said real estate) at the following rates:
The Chief Minister announced in his Budget Speech on 11 July 2023 that the stamp duty rate applicable to property sales over GBP 800,000 will increase from 3.5% to 4.5%. The effective date of this change is still to be confirmed.
Stamp duty is also payable on mortgages secured on Gibraltar real estate at the rate of 0.13% for mortgages less than GBP 200,000 and 0.20% for mortgages over GBP 200,000.
In July 2024, the government announced that new purchase agreements and assignments of off-plan purchases will be registrable instruments with a 0.5% special stamp duty payable on Assignment of Purchase Agreement (by the assignor). This will not include sales on subsidised estates.
## Payroll taxes
Collection of employee taxes is initially effected under a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. Employers are required to operate the system without exception, keep appropriate records, and complete the necessary filings.
The PAYE regulations require each employee to obtain from the Commissioner of Income Tax a PAYE allowances certificate, which allocates a code to the employee. The employer is required to use tax tables issued by the Income Tax Office to calculate and deduct tax from emoluments in accordance with the employee’s applicable code. The employer is then obligated to pay over to the Commissioner any tax so deducted by the 15th day of the following month.
An employer must also account for social insurance payments in a similar manner, deducting and paying over the employee tax as well as accounting for employer’s social insurance (*see below*).
## Social insurance contributions
Social insurance contributions are payable by every employer in respect of every employee.
Employer's contributions are calculated as 18% of gross earnings, subject to a minimum of GBP 30.45 per week (GBP 131.95 per month) and maximum of GBP 53.55 per week (GBP 232.05 per month).
## Exit tax
With effect from 1 January 2020, an exit tax of 15% is imposed on the difference between the market value of the transferred assets that would otherwise produce assessable income under the provisions of the Gibraltar Income Tax Act 2010 at the time of exit of the assets and their value for tax purposes. The exit tax may apply in the following circumstances where a taxpayer transfers:
## Gaming duty
Gaming duty is levied at 0.15% on the gross profits of holders of a bookmaker, a betting intermediary, and gaming operator’s licence. The first GBP 100,000 of gross profits is exempt from this duty.
## Capital duty
Capital duty of GBP 10 is payable on the initial authorisation of share capital or any subsequent increase thereto.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the accounting period of the company, which begins on the later of the beginning of the accounting period and the date when the company first receives a source of taxable income and ends on the earlier of the end of the accounting period, 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period, or the date on which trade ceased.
## Tax returns
Companies with income subject to tax in Gibraltar are required to file a return and calculate their tax liability for the year. The return, together with the estimated liability, needs to be accompanied by payment of the tax due nine months after the date of the company's financial year end.
Companies with assessable income of more than GBP 1.75 million are required to file audited accounts together with the tax return.
Where companies have assessable income of less than GBP 1.75 million, the accounts can be accompanied by an Independent Accountant's Report.
Companies with no assessable income are still required to file tax returns. The accounts to be filed depend on the size of the company as determined by the CA 2014. Full audited accounts are required except where the company qualifies as 'small', which would mean satisfying two of the following criteria for two consecutive years:
Where the company is 'small' and has no assessable income, only an abridged balance sheet needs to be filed.
## Payment of tax
Companies are required to make payments on account of future liabilities on 28 February and 30 September in each calendar year. Each payment should be equal to 50% of the tax payable for the relevant accounting period. The relevant accounting period is a prior accounting period whose tax payable date (i.e. nine months after the date of the company’s financial year end) precedes the first payment on account date for the accounting period in question. The relevant table in Schedule 10 of the Income Tax Act can be used to determine the correct relevant accounting period for the purposes of calculating the payments on account.
The balance of tax due (i.e. the actual liability less payments on account) is payable on the date of filing of the return.
### Penalties and fines
The following penalties and fines are applicable:
The following increased late filing penalties based on the size of companies as defined in the Companies Act 2014 will apply as of 1 July 2023 (subject to the relevant legislation being enacted):
| Company size | After due date | 3 months after due date | 6 months after due date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Micro / Small | GBP 100 | GBP 450 | GBP 750 |
| Medium | GBP 750 | GBP 1,250 | GBP 2,000 |
| Large | GBP 1,500 | GBP 3,500 | GBP 5,000 |
### Administrative fees
## Tax audit process
The Gibraltar tax system is based on self-assessment. However, the Income Tax Office has powers to make an enquiry into the tax return of a company within a period of 12 months from the date when the return is due to be filed or, if filed later than the deadline, 12 months from the date it was filed. If the Commissioner of Income Tax believes a return to be fraudulent, the above time limits will not apply.
A taxpayer may appeal against a disputed assessment by notice in writing addressed to the Commissioner within 28 days of the date of service of the notice of the assessment.
## Statute of limitations
The Commissioner has up to six years following the date of assessment to revise any incorrect assessments. There is no limit where the incorrect assessment is as a result of fraud, wilful default, or neglect.
Transfer pricing has become a priority area for the Gibraltar Tax Authorities. They have added to their resources and are undergoing a process of upskilling in this area.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Generally, companies are subject to Gibraltar taxation on income accrued in and derived from Gibraltar.
The ‘accrued in and derived from’ principle is defined by reference to the location of the activities that give rise to the profits.
Should the activity of a business be a licensable activity under Gibraltar law, the profits from this activity will be deemed to arise in Gibraltar. Furthermore, the profits of a business that can lawfully be transacted in Gibraltar, through a branch or any form of PE, by virtue of the fact that it is licensed in another jurisdiction that enjoys passporting rights into Gibraltar and which would otherwise require such licence and regulation in Gibraltar shall be deemed to arise in Gibraltar.
In the case of royalty income and inter-company interest income, both revenue streams are deemed to accrue in and derive from Gibraltar where the entity in receipt of the income is a Gibraltar-registered company.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. A first in first out (FIFO) basis of determining cost where items cannot be identified is acceptable, but not the base-stock or the last in first out (LIFO) method.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax in Gibraltar.
## Dividend income
There is no charge to tax on the receipt by a Gibraltar company of dividends from any other company.
## Interest income
Companies with a banking, money lending, DLT, or insurer licence and earning interest as a trading receipt will have that interest treated as income chargeable to tax.
Interest received or receivable by a Gibraltar company arising from an inter-company loan will be chargeable to tax at the standard CIT rate. Where the interest received or receivable is less than GBP 100,000 *per annum*, the interest is exempt from any charge to taxation.
All other interest received or receivable is not taxable in Gibraltar.
## Royalty income
Income from royalties received or receivable by a Gibraltar company is taxable at the standard CIT rate.
## Foreign income
Foreign income is not normally taxed in Gibraltar. Exceptions to this rule are interest income and royalty income (*see above*).

## Overview
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Gibraltar (the Rock) is a peninsula situated at the southern tip of Spain, facing the northern coast of Africa and dominating the western entrance to the Mediterranean. Gibraltar's strategic importance has given it a long and eventful history and an influence on world events.
The Rock now has approximately 30,000 inhabitants. English is the official language, but most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish. The currency is the Gibraltar pound (GIP), which is equal to the British pound (GBP).
On 31 January 2020, Gibraltar, together with the United Kingdom (UK), left the European Union (EU). The subsequent transition period ended on 31 December 2020. Negotiations about the United Kingdom's and Gibraltar’s future relationship with the European Union are currently ongoing.
The main sectors of the economy today are financial services, e-online gaming, tourism, a vibrant retail shopping district, and port services, including ship repair and ship conversion. Gibraltar has also positioned itself in recent years as a leading FinTech jurisdiction, being one of the first jurisdictions globally to introduce specific Distributed Ledger Technology Regulations.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Budget 2024
In July 2024, the Chief Minister and the Minister for Taxation delivered their budget speeches, which included the below announcements.
### Corporate income tax (CIT)
The rate of corporate taxation will increase from 12.5% to 15% with effect from 1 July 2024.
### Import duty
The following measures relating to import duty were announced:
### Stamp duty
New purchase agreements and assignments of off-plan purchases will be registrable instruments with a 0.5% special stamp duty payable on Assignment of Purchase Agreement (by the assignor). This will not include sales on subsidised estates.
### Restriction on brought-forward trading losses
The government will introduce legislation to restrict the use of accumulated tax losses for companies within the financial services and gaming sectors. The measure seeks to limit the brought-forward trading losses for each accounting period but will not seek to eliminate them. The measure will take effect as from 1 July 2024.
### Taxation on the profits or gains derived from property sales
The Minister for Taxation announced a new tax measure under which any entity or person who holds an interest in three or more residential properties over five consecutive years will be subject to tax on the gain upon disposal of any of the properties. Specified properties are exempt from this measure, including properties used as the primary residence of the beneficial owners and in an estate of a deceased person.
Anti-avoidance provisions will be implemented where any individuals undertaking professional conveyancing activities on behalf of another will have a reporting obligation to notify the Income Tax Office.
### Increase in audit threshold
Jointly with the Minister for Taxation, the Minister for Business announced that the audit threshold for companies will increase from GBP 1.5 million to GBP 1.75 million, applicable to accounting periods that end on or after 1 July 2024.
## Extension of taxation of interest as a trading receipt to insurers and distributed ledger technology (DLT) firms
In February 2024, the Minister of Taxation announced an extension of taxation on interest income as a trading receipt to include insurance companies and DLT firms.
The amendment to the Income Tax Act 2010 specifies interest or ’similar amounts‘ and lists these as to include financial instruments that pay a recurring amount of income, income from virtual assets, discounts, or any other arrangement that has a purpose, or one of the main purposes, to avoid tax under paragraph 15 of the Act.
Anti-avoidance provisions prevent an individual from purposely disposing of the interest-generating asset or instrument to a connected person where the interest income would be outside the scope of taxation under paragraph 15 of the Act. Where it is found that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is the avoidance of taxation, the individual disposing of the asset or instrument will be assessable to taxation as if the disposal had not occurred.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
A company will be considered resident in Gibraltar if the management and control of its business is exercised from Gibraltar or from outside Gibraltar by persons who are ordinarily tax resident in Gibraltar.
The location of central management and control will be established under legal principles laid down in the United Kingdom (UK) and is the place of the highest form of control and direction over a company's affairs, as opposed to decisions on the day-to-day running of the business.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Gibraltar Tax Commissioner accepts the definition of PE set out in Article 5 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Convention.
Under the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014 (CA 2014), foreign companies that establish a place of business in Gibraltar or have a branch in Gibraltar must register with the Registrar within one month of commencing business in Gibraltar. Under the CA 2014, the definition of a company includes a foreign company registered in Gibraltar. The profits or gains of a foreign company registered in Gibraltar shall be assessable on the accounting period beginning whenever that company is first registered in Gibraltar.

# Gibraltar
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
For the purpose of ascertaining assessable income, all expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of income shall be deducted.
## Capital allowances
The first GBP 30,000 of qualifying expenditure on plant and machinery (including fixtures and fittings) and the first GBP 50,000 of qualifying expenditure on computer equipment is fully deductible in the first year as a 'first year allowance'.
For accounting periods (or years of assessment as the case may be) ending in the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2023, the capital allowances deduction will be based on the higher of:
with the balance deductible at the rate of 25% *per annum* (30% for companies that are obligated to pay the higher CIT rate) on a reducing balance basis.
Capital allowances for industrial buildings are deductible at the rate of 4% *per annum* on a straight-line basis.
For accounting periods (or years of assessment as the case may be) ending in the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2023, a 1% general wear and tear allowance is available based on the cost of acquiring real property from where a business is conducted (excluding industrial buildings).
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not a deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
Expenditure incurred with a view to carrying on a trade is treated as incurred on the first day on which the trade is carried on for the purposes of computing the profits or gains of the trade.
## Interest expenses
Full deduction is available in respect of interest expenses, subject to anti-avoidance rules (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*).
## Bad debt
Only specific bad debts or specific bad debt provisions are deductible to the extent that they are respectively estimated to be bad during the said period, notwithstanding that such bad debts were payable prior to the commencement of the period. General doubtful debt provisions are not an allowable expense.
## Charitable contributions
A charitable donation is not considered as having been wholly and exclusively expended for the purposes of the production of the income of the trade and is therefore not allowable as a deduction for tax purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties, including those resulting from late payment of taxation or from failure to make the necessary tax submissions, are deemed to be a tax and are therefore not a deductible expense.
## Taxes
No deduction is allowed for any tax charges under the Income Tax Act.
## Other significant items
Additionally, no deduction is allowed in respect of the following:
In the case of a company that has income, some of which is chargeable to tax and some of which is not, the deductions allowed shall be apportioned on a pro-rata basis between the chargeable and non-chargeable income.
## Net operating losses
A trading loss incurred in an accounting period may be offset against trading income, if any, arising in the same period or subsequent periods.
If, however, within any period of three years there is both a change in ownership and a major change in the nature and conduct of a trade, trading losses may not be offset against trading income arising in the same or subsequent periods.
In July 2024, the government announced  a proposed restriction on accumulated trading losses for companies in the financial services and gaming sector. Legislation has yet to be published.
In 2018, the government also announced the introduction of legislation allowing the transfer of losses between group entities upon restructuring, provided that there is no change to the ultimate ownership or a change of business within a period of three years. The changes allow losses to be carried forward against a business even if the business is transferred to another company under the same ultimate ownership. A bill was published on 12 November 2020 to introduce this change and once passed it will be deemed to have come into operation on 1 July 2018. To date, this has not been passed, however, the Gibraltar tax authorities are applying the contents of the Bill administratively.
Anti-abuse provisions restrict the transfer of losses to instances of legitimate group restructuring. The transfer of accumulated losses from one type of business to another is specifically prohibited.
Any losses not connected with or arising from the trade, business, profession, or vocation are not allowable deductions.
There is no provision for the carrying back of losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
In the case of branches, the amount of general head office expenses incurred that is deductible is limited to 5% of its turnover.
The Income Tax Act includes anti-avoidance provisions. These provisions state that if the amount charged for goods or services by a connected person is not at arm's length, then the expenses that are allowed are subject to the lower of:

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Companies are assessed on an individual basis, and trading losses of group members may not be offset against profits of other members of the group.
However, a Bill was introduced in 2020 that, when enacted, will allow the transfer of losses between group entities upon restructuring, provided that there is no change to the ultimate ownership or a change of business within a period of three years. The changes allow losses to be carried forward against a business even if the business is transferred to another company under the same ultimate ownership. Anti-abuse provisions restrict the transfer of losses to instances of legitimate group restructuring. The transfer of accumulated losses from one type of business to another is specifically prohibited.
The Income Tax Act contains a generic anti-avoidance clause that allows the Commissioner to disregard an arrangement that the Commissioner believes is fictitious or artificial. In addition, it includes the following specific anti-avoidance measures.
Where a taxpayer seeks to reduce their liability to tax by creating an artificial split between activities in Gibraltar and outside of Gibraltar, the Commissioner shall use anti-avoidance provisions to defeat such an attempt.
## Transfer pricing
The general anti-avoidance rule in the Income Tax Act should be interpreted in such manner as best secures consistency with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations and other documents designated as comprising part of the transfer pricing guidelines.
There is also a specific rule in relation to interest payments. The amount of interest payments to connected persons that are in excess of that payable at arm’s length will be deemed to be a dividend. Where the amount charged for goods and services by connected persons is not at arm’s length, this will be disallowed as a taxable expense. Any expenses allowed will be subject to the lesser of (i) the expense, (ii) 5% of the gross turnover of the company, and (iii) 75% of the pre-expense profit of the company.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Under the CbC reporting regime, a Gibraltar tax resident company that is the ultimate parent entity or surrogate parent of a multinational enterprise group with consolidated revenue of at least 750 million euros (EUR) is required, for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2016, to file, within 12 months of the end of the fiscal year, a CbC report containing information on its group entities and jurisdictions in which the group operates.
A Gibraltar constituent entity of a multinational enterprise group with consolidated revenue of at least EUR 750 million is required in cases where it is not obligated to file a CbC report to notify the Gibraltar tax authorities of the identity and jurisdiction of tax residence of the entity in the group that is required to report.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest paid on a loan to related parties that are not companies (or loans where security is provided by related parties) where the ratio of the value of the loan capital to the equity of the company exceeds 5:1 will be considered as dividend payments and thus not deductible for tax purposes. This provision is not applicable to Gibraltar banks or money lenders.
## Interest limitation rule
The interest limitation rule provides that exceeding interest expenses are deductible up to the greater of (i) 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) and (ii) EUR 3 million.
## Back-to-back loans
Since interest income is not taxable on back-to-back loans, the interest expense is not deductible.
## Dual employment
Income from dual employment contracts is taxed in Gibraltar if both employers are connected persons.
## Transfer of assets abroad
Where assets are transferred abroad with the purpose of avoiding tax and the taxpayer has the power to enjoy these assets either now or in the future, then any income or benefits received from these assets will be deemed to be income chargeable to tax.
## Controlled foreign company (CFC) rule
The CFC rule attributes to a Gibraltar company the undistributed profits of a CFC (i.e. Gibraltar entity has at least 50% of either the voting rights or the capital or is entitled to receive 50% of the profits and the actual tax paid is less than 50% of the tax that would have been paid in Gibraltar on the same income) from non-genuine arrangements where the purposes is to gain a tax advantage.
## Hybrid mismatch
A hybrid mismatch that results in a double deduction for tax purposes:
A hybrid mismatch that results in a tax deduction without inclusion:
Except where one of the jurisdictions involved in the transaction(s) has made an equivalent adjustment in respect of the hybrid mismatch, a deduction for tax purposes shall be denied for payments that directly or indirectly fund expenditure that gives rise to a hybrid mismatch.
Where a hybrid mismatch results in disregarded PE income, the taxpayer must include the income that would otherwise be attributed to the disregarded PE. This does not apply to income exempted under a double taxation treaty (DTT).
Where a hybrid financial instrument results in withholding tax (WHT) relief to more than one party, the benefit of such relief is limited in proportion to the net taxable income of the payment.
A 'hybrid mismatch' includes any of the following:

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
The basis for taxation of branches of foreign enterprises is the same as for corporations.
Allowable head office charges or expenses incurred by a Gibraltar branch for the common purpose of the company and its branches, or for the purpose of the head office or another branch exclusively, are limited to 5% of turnover of the Gibraltar branch (*see Payments to foreign affiliates in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Mandatory disclosure regime (DAC6)
Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements was introduced into Gibraltar law on 30 January 2020 and imposes an obligation on tax consultants, banks, lawyers, and other intermediaries to disclose any cross-border arrangement that contains one or more features or 'hallmarks' if they are identified as intermediaries for the purposes of the Directive.
### Scope
On 21 January 2021, the Gibraltar Competent Authority for the exchange of information for tax purposes announced that Gibraltar is limiting the scope of reporting under DAC6. Following the approach adopted in the United Kingdom, reporting in Gibraltar will be limited to cross-border arrangements falling within Category D Hallmarks (CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures). The Income Tax Act 2010 has been amended to reflect this change. However, note that the International Agreements on Taxation Matters (Spain) Regulations 2021 have introduced equivalent reporting requirements to DAC6 in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements involving Gibraltar and Spain.
'Arrangements', which are defined broadly to include an agreement, scheme, plan, transaction, etc. or series thereof, can involve several parts or stages of implementation or execution.
There is no requirement to report on purely domestic arrangements, and VAT, customs, and excise duties are also outside the scope of the new reporting regime.
### Hallmarks
The DAC6 reporting obligations focus on cross-border tax planning arrangements that meet certain hallmarks intended to highlight potential risk of tax avoidance. The reporting obligation only arises if one or more of these hallmarks is triggered.
The hallmarks introduced by the Regulations follow those contained in the Directive. No additional hallmarks are introduced.
In line with the Directive, certain hallmarks trigger reporting obligations only where obtaining of a tax advantage is the main benefit or one of the main benefits of the arrangement. However, other hallmarks trigger reporting in all cases, regardless of whether obtaining a tax advantage is the main benefit or not.
As a result of the change in scope of DAC6 reporting requirements in Gibraltar, in practice:
### Reporting obligations
The reporting obligation falls on the intermediary or the taxpayer according to detailed rules regarding the parties and jurisdictions involved.
Where bound by professional (legal) privilege, an intermediary will be exempt from the reporting obligation. An intermediary exempt from reporting obligations will nevertheless have to notify other intermediaries or if there is no such intermediary the relevant taxpayer of their reporting obligations.
The reporting obligations started to apply from 1 January 2021.
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
Gibraltar has entered into Model 1 IGA reciprocal agreements with both the United States (US) and United Kingdom. The Gibraltar/UK agreement was signed 21 November 2013 and the Gibraltar/US agreement was signed 8 May 2014. Legislation in the form of regulations have been passed.
Information will be exchanged by the Competent Authorities nine months after the year-end. The first due date for exchange by the Competent Authorities was 30 September 2016 for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 for UK reportable accounts and was 30 September 2015 for the year ended 31 December 2014 for US reportable accounts. The reporting deadline for reportable accounts is 31 July.
The Gibraltar government was an early adopter of the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS). The legislation was enacted on 22 December 2016. The first date that information was exchanged by the Competent Authorities was 30 September 2017 for the period ended 31 December 2016. The reporting deadline for reportable accounts is 31 July.
The Country-by-Country Reporting Regime was introduced into Gibraltar in 2017 as part of Article 13 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan.
Under this regime, where a Gibraltar tax resident company is the ultimate parent entity of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with consolidated revenue of at least EUR 750 million, it will be obligated, for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2016, to file, within 12 months of the end of the fiscal year, a CbC report containing the following information with regards to each jurisdiction in which the group operates:
The report also requires identification of each constituent entity of the group, setting out for each entity the jurisdiction of tax residence (where different also the country of registration) as well as the nature of the main business activity.
The regulations also impose a requirement for a Gibraltar constituent entity to report in cases where it is not the ultimate parent entity, these are either where (i) the ultimate parent entity is not required to provide a report in its jurisdiction of residence, (ii) the jurisdiction of residence of the ultimate parent entity does not have a qualifying competent authority agreement with Gibraltar at the date the report is required, or (iii) there has been a systematic failure by the jurisdiction of tax residence of the ultimate parent entity and the Commissioner has notified the Gibraltar constituent entity that the failure has occurred. In these cases, the first reporting period is for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2017.
There are notification requirements in the regulations. A Gibraltar constituent entity must notify the Commissioner if it is an ultimate parent entity, a surrogate parent entity, or in cases where it will be filing a CbC report because there has been a systematic failure by the jurisdiction of tax residence of the ultimate parent entity and the Commissioner has notified the Gibraltar constituent entity of this. A notification must also be made by a Gibraltar constituent entity who does not fall into the above mentioned categories. This type of notification must provide the identity and the jurisdiction of tax residence of the constituent entity required to file the CbC report on behalf of its MNE group. These notifications must be made in writing no later than nine months after the year-end of the Gibraltar constituent entity.
Gibraltar has also signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) with a number of jurisdictions.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Double taxation relief
Any person ordinarily resident in Gibraltar who is liable to pay tax in Gibraltar in respect of income also taxed abroad is eligible to claim double taxation relief in respect of the tax paid abroad. On furnishing evidence of the payment made abroad, the claimant is entitled to a credit equivalent to the lesser of the:
If relief from the double taxation is given abroad, the relief then given in Gibraltar is reduced accordingly.
A claim for double taxation relief has to be made within the six years after the end of the year of assessment to which it relates. The time limit is extended where any adjustment or assessment made in Gibraltar or abroad renders any relief previously given excessive or insufficient. In those circumstances, a claim may be made within the six years after the adjustment or assessment.
## Spain Tax Agreement
On 4 March 2019, an International Tax Agreement between the United Kingdom (which retains constitutional responsibility for Gibraltar’s external relations) and the Kingdom of Spain was signed, which entered into force on 4 March 2021.
The Tax Agreement principally seeks to improve cooperation in the field of taxation and assist in the resolution of disputes as to the proper tax residence of companies and individuals where their place of residence between Gibraltar and Spain may be in issue.
The Agreement also provides for Gibraltar to keep legislation equivalent with EU law on matters related to transparency, administrative cooperation, harmful tax practises, and Anti-Money Laundering after Gibraltar has left the European Union.
## UK Tax Agreement
On 1 October 2019, the United Kingdom government and the government of Gibraltar signed a Double Taxation Agreement based on the OECD Model Tax Convention with the purpose of eliminating double taxation with respect to taxes on income and capital and preventing tax evasion and avoidance.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Budget summary
Below is a summary of the key taxation changes to existing legislation as a result of the Chief Minister’s and Minister for Taxation's budget speeches in July 2024.
### Personal tax rates
The tax rates on all bands under both the Allowance Based System and Gross Income Based System will reduce by 1% for individuals with gross assessable income not exceeding 100,000 British pounds (GBP) *per annum*.
Tax rates will reduce by 2% for individuals with gross assessable income exceeding GBP 100,000 *per annum*.
The reduction is a reversal of tax rate increases announced in the Chief Minister’s Budget in June 2022, where he announced the rates increased temporarily by 2%.
### Taxation on the profits or gains derived from property sales
The Minister for Taxation announced a new tax measure under which any entity or person who holds an interest in three or more residential properties will be subject to tax on the gain upon disposal of any of the properties. Specified properties are exempt from this measure, including properties used as the primary residence of the beneficial owner and in an estate of a deceased person.
Anti-avoidance measures will be implemented where any individuals undertaking professional conveyancing activities on behalf of another will have a reporting obligation to notify the Income Tax Office.
### Stamp duty
New purchase agreements and assignments of off-plan purchases will be registrable instruments with a 0.5% special stamp duty payable on Assignment of Purchase Agreement (by the assignor). This will not include sales on subsidised estates.
### Import duty
The following measures relating to import duty were announced:
### Statutory minimum wage
The statutory hourly minimum wage increased from GBP 8.60 to GBP 8.90 (a 3.5% increase) from 1 July 2024.
### Green procurement
A tax deduction of an additional 50% in respect of any cost or expense of achieving net zero is available. This is subject to the Commissioner of Income Tax considering the deduction reasonable and directly associated with achieving the net zero objective. The deduction will be capped at a maximum of GBP 10,000 *per annum*.
### Living accommodation exemption
The Minister for Taxation announced a review of the accommodation exemption per Schedule 7 of the Income Tax Act 2010. The review will include changing the seven-year exemption period, the Minister noting that the average stay of employees relocating to Gibraltar is not beyond three to four years. In addition, the review will seek to implement flexibility in allowing an employee to continue using the exemption when changing the address or employment during the applicable period.
### Student exemption
A clarification was announced regarding the tax status of full-time students in part-time employment. Income received by full-time students in part-time employment will continue to be tax-exempt, albeit the Income Tax Office will apply a tax-exempt threshold of GBP 11,450. As such, employment income above the threshold will be subject to income tax.
Notwithstanding, this does not change the other criteria by which students are tax-exempt.

4. Interest payable on a loan to acquire a Gibraltar property to be used as a taxpayer’s principle residence is allowable on loans up to a value of GBP 350,000. Loan arrangements entered into before 1 July 2008 are eligible for relief on 100% of the loan as long as the loan continues to be secured on the current property and is in the name of the current borrower. The interest on these loans are subject to ‘tapered grandfathering’, whereby the relief on the amount of the loan in excess of GBP 350,000 will be reduced by 1/10 *per annum*.
### Allowance Based System deductions

Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Employment income
All remuneration paid in cash or in kind is taxable without regard to length of residence or source of income. Benefits in kind are taxed as if they were income from employment.
Specific legislation has been introduced on how to tax benefits and the allowances available, particularly on the following:
The notable exceptions are contributions paid to an approved pension scheme, medical insurance premiums up to GBP 3,000, and the cost of providing accommodation to a relocated employee for the first seven years, which are all exempt from tax.
The Commissioner may also tax benefits not specifically covered in legislation. The value of the benefit is the cost to the employer less any amount made good by the employee.
There is a non-taxable allowance in respect of benefits, where the total annual value of the benefit is less than GBP 250 in respect of any employee.
The employer may opt to pay the tax on the benefits on behalf of an employee. When the annual value of these benefits is between GBP 250 and GBP 15,000, tax shall be paid at the rate of 20%. When the annual value of the benefit is more than GBP 15,000, tax shall be paid at the rate of 29%.
## Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains in Gibraltar.
## Dividend income
Dividends are taxable to the extent that the underlying income of the company comprises income that is taxable in Gibraltar.
## Interest income
There is no tax on interest income in Gibraltar.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Tax credits and allowances for ordinarily residents
Persons will be able to claim a tax credit on the following items:
A separate application for the gym/personal trainer and private school tuition tax credit will need to be made to the Income Tax Office along with proof of payment. The tax credit is not an allowance and will not be reflected in a person's tax code. It will only be reflected in a person's assessment.
Regarding the tax credit for LSRA fees, details of the application process are yet to be published.
## Category 2 tax incentives
A Category 2 individual shall only be liable to income tax on the first GBP 118,000 of income *per annum* under the Allowances Based System (on income of GBP 105,000, this equates to a total tax charge of GBP 42,380). The minimum amount of tax payable in any tax year is GBP 37,000.
In order to be issued with a Category 2 certificate, an individual must:
## High executive possessing specialist skills (HEPSS) tax incentives
A HEPSS individual shall only be liable to income tax on the first GBP 160,000 of income *per annum* under the Gross Income Based System (on income of GBP 160,000, this equates to a total tax charge of GBP 39,940).
In order to be issued with a HEPSS certificate, an individual must:
## Green incentives
A one-off tax deduction is introduced against assessable income (with the percentage to be verified and subject to the discretion of the Commissioner of Income Tax) on the investment made by an individual, company, or business that makes a significant improvement to the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of the premises.
## Property investment incentive
A tax-free property investment incentive is available for owners of property constructed in Gibraltar in the next 30 months from 1 July 2016 and rented for residential purposes. These owners will receive a tax credit equal to the tax payable on the profits earned on the first 24 months of rent occurring in the first five years after the completion of construction of that property. This tax credit is non-refundable and can be offset against the tax payable to extinguish any liability to tax.
