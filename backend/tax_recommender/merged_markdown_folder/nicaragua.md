# Nicaragua
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
Taxable income is determined by the sum of all income derived from Nicaraguan sources, less allowable deductions, which generally include all expenses necessary to generate taxable income. Taxable income is computed according to Nicaraguan income tax law.
## Inventory valuation
Last in first out (LIFO), first in first out (FIFO), and the average cost methods are accepted for inventory valuation purposes. The tax authorities must authorise the change of a valuation method.
## Capital gains and losses
Capital income and capital gains and losses are subject to definitive WHT and are not treated as ordinary taxable corporate income. The general rule is that capital income and capital gains are subject to 15% WHT; however, the following exceptions apply:
| Good value (USD\*) | | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | Through |
| 0.01 | 50,000.00 | 1 |
| 50,000.01 | 100,000.00 | 2 |
| 100,000.01 | 200,000.00 | 3 |
| 200,000.01 | 300,000.00 | 4 |
| 300,000.01 | 400,000.00 | 5 |
| 400,000.01 | 500,000.00 | 6 |
| 500,000.01 | To more | 7 |
\* United States dollars
## Dividend income
Stock dividends paid by Nicaraguan entities to resident shareholders are subject to a 15% definitive WHT.
## Interest income
Interest received from a Nicaraguan source, as well as the interest gained from deposits placed in the national financial system, is subject to a 15% WHT.
Investment grade interest paid to international banks is subject to a 10% WHT.
The WHT will not apply if the beneficiary of the interest payment is included in the list of exempt International Credit Institutions and Agencies or Foreign Governments Development Institutions, provided in the Ministerial Agreement 24-2014 (reformed by the Ministerial Agreement 3-2022), which requires that the beneficiary should request the Finance and Public Credit Ministry for the corresponding exemption recognition.
## Royalty income
Royalties are treated as capital income subject to a 15% WHT.
## Foreign income
Business enterprises are subject to CIT only on Nicaraguan-source income.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The following transactions are subject to VAT when performed within Nicaragua:
VAT is imposed at a 15% rate on the sale of goods, rendering of services, grant of use of assets, and import of goods. Export of goods and services are subject to a 0% rate.
VAT exemptions are available for certain items, including medicine, real estate transfer, sale of used goods, basic food products, credit instruments, tuition, and textbooks and educational supplies.
Taxpayers may recover VAT paid for the purchase of goods and services used to generate other goods and services subject to VAT. This is known as VAT liquidation, which is determined by subtracting VAT credits paid on transactions needed to generate taxable income for VAT purposes from VAT collected on the sales of goods or the rendering of services. Note that VAT paid on transactions to generate non-taxable income for VAT purposes are not allowed as VAT credits.
The exemption with right to deduct input VAT applies when:
VAT returns must be filed monthly, with payment due in full on the same day for those classified as high and principal taxpayers. Taxpayers registered as high taxpayers (with annual income greater than 160 million Nicaraguan córdobas [NIO]) must present an advanced bi-weekly VAT payment in the first five business days after the 15th day of each month and a definite return in the first five calendar days of the following month.
## Selective consumption tax
A selective consumption tax is applied to goods considered to be non-essential. The tax base is the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price for imported items, and the tax is levied and paid only at that stage (based on the list of products published as an appendix to Law 822).
As of 1 January 2023, the following additional charges to the excise tax entered into force:
## Customs duties
### Temporary Admission for Active Processing (TAP) regime
Exporters can apply for the TAP regime, which is designed to allow the importation of goods without payment of duties, import taxes, or other taxes, on condition of being transformed (i.e. subject to any subsequent operation) to be re-exported or exonerated.
## Transfer taxes
Nicaragua's tax system does not impose transfer taxes.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp duty is levied on certain types of documents issued in Nicaragua.
## Payroll taxes
The employer is responsible to withhold and pay employee income tax monthly through withholding income tax return Form IR-122, according to progressive tax rates.
## Social security contributions
In principle, social charges apply monthly to nationals and legal residents from the first day of employment. Social security contributions are calculated upon the gross salary of the employee, as follows:
|  | Social security rates (%) | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pension | Family health | Labour healthcare | War victims | Total |
| Employer | 12.50/13.50 \* | 6.00 | 1.50 | 1.50 | 21.50/22.50 |
| Employee | 4.75 | 2.25 | 0 | 0 | 7.00 |
\* Employers with 50 employees or less will contribute 12.50%. Employers with greater than 50 employees will contribute 13.50%.
The employer must also pay 2% of its payroll, monthly, for Training Tax (INATEC).
## Municipal sales and services tax
A monthly 1% tax is levied on all sales of goods and rendering of services performed within each of the municipalities of the country.
## Municipal registration tax
An annual 2% tax is levied by each municipality where the taxpayer has an office or establishment, on the average of income received in the months of October, November, and December of the previous year. In the case of the incorporation of a new establishment or enterprise, the municipal registration tax is 1% of the capital invested.
## Real estate municipal tax
The real estate municipal tax is an annual tax that is levied at a rate of 1% on 80% of cadastral value, as recorded by the government. If the cadastral value is not available, the cost or fiscal appraisal value may be used.

# Nicaragua
## Overview
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America, bordered by Honduras to the north, Costa Rica to the south, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. It became an independent republic in 1838, and Managua is the capital city. The official language of Nicaragua is Spanish, and its currency is the Nicaraguan córdoba oro (NIO).
Currently, 70.9% of the population is younger than 40, and elementary, high school, and university education are mandatory, the first two being free. There is one Nicaraguan branch of a United States university that has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The Nicaraguan government is increasing funding to improve educational opportunities in the country and has promoted increased enrolment in universities.
All schools, including elementary and high school, are under the general supervision and regulation of the National Ministry of Education.
In early 2004, Nicaragua secured 4.5 billion United States dollars (USD) in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and, in October 2007, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a new poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) program.
Nicaraguan expects an increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) of between 3.5% and 4.5% in 2024, after having experienced a 4.6 % increase in 2023. The above contrasts with the decrease of -1.8% in 2020, and the increase of 10.3% in 2021, but is in line with the 2022 growth of 3.8%. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports.

# Nicaragua
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Taxable period
The standard tax year in Nicaragua is the calendar year (from 1 January to 31 December); however, companies can obtain authorisation from the tax authorities in order to change or have a different year-end: 31 March, 30 June, or 30 September.
## Tax returns
Without exception, all corporations are required to file CIT returns for a fiscal year within the following two months after the fiscal year-end.
## Payment of tax
Corporations shall pay fiscal-year income tax in monthly advance payments. The monthly payable amount is calculated between 1% and 3% of gross income.
Final CIT payment is due with the final CIT return (i.e. within the following two months after the fiscal year-end).
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities are entitled to conduct a tax audit of the taxpayer when considered necessary. The taxpayer has the obligation to submit before the tax auditor the corporate information and documents related to the generation of income.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation in Nicaragua is up to the last four fiscal-ended periods. Nonetheless, an extraordinary extension to the last six fiscal-ended periods could be enforced in case of misreporting or tax fraud.
In Nicaragua, tax audits are determined randomly; however, high taxpayers or taxpayers who request reimbursement of tax credit are more likely to be audited. For corporate tax compliance, the tax authorities normally seek information regarding taxpayer operations through the advance income tax returns.

Nicaragua taxes its citizens and all residents and non-residents on their income originating in Nicaragua. Taxable income that originates in Nicaragua obtained by non-residents or non-domiciled persons is determined as a percentage of gross income, depending on the nature of the income.
## Personal income tax rates
Residents are subject to income tax according to the progressive tax rates shown below:
| Taxable income (NIO\*) | | Minimum tax charge (NIO) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 100,000 | 0 | 0 |
| 100,000 | 200,000 | 0 | 15 |
| 200,000 | 350,000 | 15,000 | 20 |
| 350,000 | 500,000 | 45,000 | 25 |
| 500,000 | and above | 82,500 | 30 |
\* Nicaraguan córdobas
Non-residents, whether domiciled or not, who receive Nicaraguan-source income are subject to a 20% definitive WHT.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Taxable period
## Tax returns
Individuals who obtain income only from employment (i.e. an employer) and do not benefit from the deduction for expenses on education, health, and professional services are not obligated to submit an annual income tax return.
The annual individual income tax return (Form IR-106) is applicable for taxpayers who obtain income from two or more employers that, in the aggregate, exceed an annual income of NIO 100,000. The taxpayer should submit the annual income tax return within 90 days after year-end.
## Payment of tax
The employer, through the payroll, is responsible to withhold and pay the income tax on a monthly basis through withholding income tax return Form IR-122.
For those individuals filing the annual individual income tax return (Form IR-106), the final tax payment is due within 90 days after year-end.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
Nicaragua has a territorial income tax system under which only income generated in, or that causes effects in, Nicaragua is generally subject to income tax. Corporate income tax (CIT) is imposed on a corporation's profits, which consist of business/trading income, and passive income. Capital incomes and capital gains are subject to definitive withholding tax (WHT). General business expenses are allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income.
## Corporate income tax (CIT) rate
CIT is levied only on domestic-sourced income at a flat rate of the higher of:
The income tax will be the greater amount that results from comparing the 30% applicable to net taxable income and the definite minimum tax described above.
The law establishes the following exceptions to the 1% to 3% definitive minimum tax:

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
Legal entities considered as a tax resident must comply with one of the following criteria:
The legal forms permitted in Nicaragua to constitute a corporation are stock corporations or limited liability companies, either as subsidiaries or branches.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Law 822 has incorporated a definition of ‘permanent establishment’ into the Nicaraguan income tax regime. This term means a place through which a non-resident taxpayer wholly or partially carries on business, including, *inter alia*, the following: a place of management; a branch; an office or agent; a factory; a workshop; and a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.
Such definition also includes a building site or construction or installation project or connected supervision activities, but only if its duration exceeds six months; and the performance of consultancy services if they exceed six months within an annual period.
A PE may also be created where a person other than an agent of independent status acts on behalf of a non-resident taxpayer if:
These PE rules will not apply to a branch or PE of non-resident taxpayers operating business activities of marine and air transportation of cargo and passengers, as well as land cargo transportation.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation must be computed using the straight-line method. Depending on the type of construction and the estimated life of fixed assets, annual rates for depreciation are as follows:
| Asset | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings (rental/commercial/industrial) | 3.33/5/10 |
| Vehicles (other/commercial/rental) | 12/20/33.33 |
| Plant and equipment (fixed/non-fixed/agricultural) | 10/14/20 |
| Other assets (office/other/computer) | 10/20/50 |
### Alternative method of depreciation
## Goodwill
Goodwill, meaning the excess paid over book value in the acquisition of an entire business, may be part of the deductible cost for capital gain tax purposes in a future sale, provided the said price would also have been subject to the respective capital gain tax.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are amortised over a three-year period after the beginning of business operations.
## Interest expenses
As a general rule, deduction of interest is allowed when derived from loans of financial institutions; however, the interest paid derived from loans of non-financial institutions will be deductible up to the amount resulting from applying the average lending rate of the national bank at the date of obtaining the loan, if fixed, or at the date of each payment, if variable.
In order for interest paid to a non-resident to be deductible, the corresponding 15% WHT must be withheld and paid.
## Bad debt
## Charitable contributions
A deduction is allowed, at up to 10% of the corporation's net taxable income, for charitable contributions made to the government and its institutions, the White Cross, and other organisations.
## Compensation
A deduction of up to 10% of the net profit before this expense is allowed for payments made to employees as bonuses or in addition to their salaries or wages.
## Life insurance
A deduction of up to 10% of the wages paid is allowed for collective employee insurance payments made.
## Fines and penalties
Penalties or charges made by tax, customs, social security, or municipal authorities are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
In principle, income tax expense is not deductible for CIT purposes. Nonetheless, municipal or local taxes (i.e. real estate tax, monthly sales and services tax, annual registration tax) are deductible from CIT.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward and deducted from future profits, for up to three years. The carry back of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments made from affiliates to foreign related parties are deductible for CIT purposes, provided the following requirements are met:

# Nicaragua
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
The Nicaragua tax system does not recognise any form of foreign tax credit.
## Tourism incentives
Under present law, and on a case-by-case basis, new companies with tourist activities may request and the government may grant, during the facilities’ construction phase, total exemption of customs duties and partial or total CIT exemption for a maximum period of ten years.
## Renewable energy incentives
The renewable energy sector is covered by a special law with tax benefits or exemptions in CIT, VAT, customs duties, and municipal tax.
## Free trade zones (FTZs)
The Nicaraguan government abrogated Decree No. 46-91, and enacted Law 917/2015 - Export Free Trade Zone Law, which provides for several types of export free zones (e.g. for processing, industrial production, logistics and outsourcing services).
Although the law does not bring major changes with respect to Decree No. 46-91, it has modified the tax exemption period to FTZ users, and, as of the publication of this law (i.e. 16 October 2015), they will qualify for a ten-year income tax holiday, which can be extended for an additional ten years. Once the full tax exemption expires, qualifying companies will be entitled to a 60% exemption. These incentives are subject to the approval of the National Free Zone Commission.
Qualifying companies are entitled to exemptions from capital tax and stamp duties, indirect and excise taxes, export taxes on locally made products, municipal taxes, and the immovable property transfer tax and capital gains tax on the alienation of immovable property if they are closing their operations in the FTZ and the immovable property will remain there.
Raw materials, machinery, equipment, spare parts, samples, molds, and accessories required for the operation of companies in the FTZs are exempt from import duties.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
The Nicaragua tax system does not recognise any form of foreign tax credit.
## Tax treaties
Although Nicaragua has not signed any agreement or treaty with any country to avoid double taxation on a general basis; in December 2022, an Air Transport Agreement signed between Mexico and Nicaragua contained rules to avoid double taxation on such matter.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Employment deductions
An employee's social security contribution (7.00%) is considered as a deductible expense for income tax purposes.
## Personal deductions
25% of the gross labour income related to education, health, and professional services expenses is deductible, up the amount of NIO 20,000. These deductions require the authorisation of the tax authorities.
## Business deductions
Personal business-related expenses are deductible if properly documented and accounted for and if accepted by the fiscal authorities as proportional to income originated by the business activities. Total business expenses can be determined *ex officio* by the fiscal authorities as a percentage of gross income.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
## Employment income
Income from work includes every kind of compensation and remuneration, whatever their denomination or nature, money or in kind, that is derived from the personal work rendered on behalf of others, such as salaries, variable salaries, seniority bonds, bonuses, allowances, performance recognition, and any other remuneration derived from work. There are no concessions of any kind to foreigners. Total personal gross income can be estimated *ex officio* by the fiscal establishment.
