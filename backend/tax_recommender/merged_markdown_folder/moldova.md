## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Social security contributions (SSC)
Contributions to the Social Security Budget are mandatory; however, unlike taxes, they have an exact destination and are available for refund to the beneficiary individuals in the form of pensions, allowances, etc.
Employers must pay SSC of 24% (with some exceptions) of their employees' gross salary, meal tickets, and other remunerations to the Social Security Fund. The legislation provides annual fixed SSC for other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 20,518 applicable in 2025).
The table below summarises information about the type of employers and SSC rates applicable for them.
| Type of employer | Employer SSC rate |
| --- | --- |
| Employers in the private sector, higher education, and medical institutions | 24% |
| Employers for employees working in special conditions | 32% |
| Employers in agriculture | 24%, with 18% paid by the employer and 6% by the state budget |
Employers have to report SSC on a monthly basis (with certain exceptions) through the unique payroll tax return. The SSC due must be transferred by the employer to the budget no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
For foreign citizens and stateless people employed under labour agreements in Moldova, SSC are computed similarly as for Moldovan citizens (with some exceptions).
Moldova currently has social security agreements concluded with Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Spain, Lavia. Moldova also has pension agreements concluded with Azerbaijan, Italy, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
## Health insurance contributions
The mandatory health insurance contribution, computed as a percentage of wages and other remuneration, is established at 9% and is fully borne by the employees. The legislation also provides for an annual fixed amount of health insurance contribution paid by other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 12,636 applicable in 2025).
For foreign citizens and stateless people employed under labour agreements in Moldova, health insurance contributions are computed similarly as for Moldovan citizens. In the absence of a local labour agreement, foreign citizens can opt for optional health insurance from a private provider.
Moldovan citizens who are unemployed and not insured by the government have the liability to pay fixed health insurance contributions if their presence in Moldova exceeds 183 calendar days.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Moldova is currently 20%. It is generally applied to local supplies of goods and services as well as to goods subject to import and services subject to the reverse charge mechanism.
## Wealth tax
Starting with 2016, a wealth tax has been introduced in Moldova for individuals who own real estate (except for land).
The object of taxation is considered the real estate of residential destination that meets simultaneously the following conditions:
The taxable base of real estate is represented by its estimated value determined by territorial cadastral bodies (with some exceptions).
The wealth tax rate is 0.8% of the taxable base.
The wealth tax is payable by 25 December of the reporting year, based on the notification of payment presented by the territorial tax offices for the situation existing as at 1 November of the reporting year.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Patrimony received by Moldovan citizens by inheritance is not taxable. Moldovan tax law does not provide for separate gift taxes, such income being subject to general rules.
## Tax on immovable property
Property tax is imposed on property located in Moldova and owned both by Moldovan and foreign citizens. The tax applies to the estimated value of buildings, houses, apartments, and land and the rate depends on the location. The minimum rate is 0.05%, but the effective rate is determined by the representative local authorities annually.
The land tax rate for individuals depends on the land's destination (e.g. land for agriculture usage) and location, its cadastral index and surface, but cannot exceed MDL 30 for 100 square metres.
There are also separate rates for agricultural land with construction buildings on it (minimum rate of 0.1%, but the effective rate is determined by the representative local authorities annually).
Starting 1 January 2021, individuals may no longer benefit from a 15% discount at the full payment of the tax on immovable property by 30 June.
For certain categories of real estate, the local council can increase the real estate tax by up to 300%.
## Customs duties
Individuals are exempt from the payment of customs duties on goods whose customs value does not exceed 150 euros (EUR) per parcel of goods.
Individuals should pay import duties on goods imported by mail deliveries in business-to-consumer (B2C) commercial transactions. The provisions apply to goods of a commercial nature exceeding the quantitative limits established by the law or that have an intrinsic value exceeding EUR 150 per parcel of goods.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Resident legal entities are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-resident entities are taxed on their Moldovan-sourced income. Taxable income is computed as accounting profit adjusted in accordance with tax legislation.
## Inventory valuation
Under the National Accounting Standards, the following inventory valuation methods are mandatory: specific identification, first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), and weighted average cost.
Assets are generally valued at their acquisition cost, production cost, or market value.
## Capital gains
Transactions with capital assets performed by the companies are subject to general taxation rules.
## Dividend income
Starting 1 January 2021, dividends paid by Moldovan legal entities to other Moldovan legal entities from profit earned since 2012 do not represent taxable income.
Dividends are generally subject to a 6% WHT, except for those distributed from profits earned between 2008 and 2011, which are subject to a final WHT of 15%.
Dividends received by Moldovan legal entities from foreign legal entities are included in taxable income and taxed according to general established rules. According to Moldovan legislation, the beneficiary of such dividends is entitled to a credit for the tax paid in the foreign country, within certain limits.
## Interest income
In general, the interest income derived by legal entities is included in the total taxable amount and taxed at the applicable 12% CIT rate.
## Royalty income
Royalties are defined as payments of any kind received in consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright and/or ancillary right of a literary, artistic, or scientific work, including moving pictures, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, software, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific expertise.

In general, royalties derived by legal entities are included in the total taxable amount and taxed at the applicable 12% CIT rate.
## Exchange gains and losses

From 17 June 2024, the allowance for increasing access to quality education, provided by the Education Code, in the amount and manner established by the government, will also be considered non-taxable.
## Foreign income
Resident legal entities are taxed on their worldwide income. The legal entities, under certain conditions, can benefit from tax credits provided under a double tax treaty (DTT) or can apply for unilateral tax credits against income tax paid in any foreign country if this income is subject to taxation in Moldova. Such tax credit shall not exceed the amount that would have been estimated at the CIT rate applicable in the given tax period. Otherwise, there is no specific tax deferral regime.

# Moldova
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The Republic of Moldova is a small and densely populated landlocked country in Eastern Europe, located between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south, which gained its independence in 1991. Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, is situated in the centre of the country, has a population of around 891,725 people, and represents the cultural, political, and economic hub of the country. The currency of Moldova is the leu (MDL), and the main spoken language is Romanian.
Moldova is a democratic republic, based on the rule of law. Its legal framework is based mainly on statutory law. Under the Constitution, Moldova undertakes to respect the treaties and conventions to which it is party.
As of 27 June 2014, the Republic of Moldova ratified the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) that fully entered into force as of 1 July 2016. Consequently, Moldova should gradually harmonise local legislation with the provisions of EU law. As of 23 June 2022, Moldova has been granted EU candidate status. Moldova set a target date of 2030 for EU accession.
On 14 December 2023, the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Moldova. It is one of nine current EU candidate countries, together with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.
From January to September 2024, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Moldova totalled MDL 233.1 billion, which represents an increase of 0.6 % in real terms compared to the same period of 2023.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Residents
Resident legal entities making payments to individuals (other than salary payments) must withhold and pay WHT to the MTA at the following rates:
## Non-residents
The following WHT rates apply upon payments to non-residents:
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
The DTTs in force between Moldova and other countries may provide for more favourable tax rates than those provided by the local provisions. For their application, the foreign beneficiary of such income should provide the paying entity with its fiscal residency certificate before the payments are actually made. The Moldovan tax law expressly provides that the DTTs prevail over the national provisions. The only exception refers to the case where the domestic norms provide for more favourable tax rates (i.e. in such circumstances, the domestic ones shall apply).
Currently, Moldova has 50 operational DTTs, as outlined below:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Moldovan residents (both Moldovan citizens and foreigners) are subject to taxation for their income received during the fiscal period from any sources within the Republic of Moldova, as well as from sources outside the country for their work activity effectively performed in the Republic of Moldova (except income that is expressly tax exempt under the Moldovan law).
Moldovan citizens receiving investment and financial income from sources outside Moldova are also subject to tax on this income in Moldova.
At the same time, individuals qualifying as non-residents for Moldovan personal income tax (PIT) purposes are subject to Moldovan tax for the income derived from Moldovan sources (e.g. income received from property located in Moldova, remuneration for activity performed in Moldova, interest and royalties received from Moldovan legal entities).
## Personal income tax rates
The Tax Code provides the following PIT rates for 2025:
| Type of income | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| For residents (standard taxation): |  |
| Income from employment, including benefits in kind and from professional or entrepreneurial activity | 12% from the total taxable income |
| Capital gains | 12% from the total taxable income |
| Other taxable income | 12% from the total taxable income |
| Individual entrepreneurs | 12% from the total taxable income |
| Income for farming enterprises | 7% |
| For residents (final taxation): |  |
| Dividends, except for 2008 to 2011 profit distribution | 6% |
| Dividends related to 2008 to 2011 profit distribution | 15% |
| Income from the withdrawn amount from the share equity related to previously increased share equity upon distribution of the net profit and/or other sources recorded in the owners’ equity between shareholders (associates) according the participation share in the equity for the fiscal period 2010/11. | 15% |

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Social security contributions (SSC)
Contributions to the Social Security Budget are mandatory; however, unlike taxes, they have an exact destination and are available for refund to the beneficiary individuals in the form of pensions, allowances, etc.
Employers must pay SSC of 24% (with some exceptions) of their employees' gross salary, meal tickets, and other remunerations to the Social Security Fund. The legislation provides annual fixed SSC for other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 20,518 applicable in 2025).
The table below summarises information about the type of employers and SSC rates applicable for them.
| Type of employer | Employer SSC rate |
| --- | --- |
| Employers in the private sector, higher education, and medical institutions | 24% |
| Employers for employees working in special conditions | 32% |
| Employers in agriculture | 24%, with 18% paid by the employer and 6% by the state budget |
Employers have to report SSC on a monthly basis (with certain exceptions) through the unique payroll tax return. The SSC due must be transferred by the employer to the budget no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
For foreign citizens and stateless people employed under labour agreements in Moldova, SSC are computed similarly as for Moldovan citizens (with some exceptions).
Moldova currently has social security agreements concluded with Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Spain, Lavia. Moldova also has pension agreements concluded with Azerbaijan, Italy, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
## Health insurance contributions
The mandatory health insurance contribution, computed as a percentage of wages and other remuneration, is established at 9% and is fully borne by the employees. The legislation also provides for an annual fixed amount of health insurance contribution paid by other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 12,636 applicable in 2025).
For foreign citizens and stateless people employed under labour agreements in Moldova, health insurance contributions are computed similarly as for Moldovan citizens. In the absence of a local labour agreement, foreign citizens can opt for optional health insurance from a private provider.
Moldovan citizens who are unemployed and not insured by the government have the liability to pay fixed health insurance contributions if their presence in Moldova exceeds 183 calendar days.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Moldova is currently 20%. It is generally applied to local supplies of goods and services as well as to goods subject to import and services subject to the reverse charge mechanism.
## Wealth tax
Starting with 2016, a wealth tax has been introduced in Moldova for individuals who own real estate (except for land).
The object of taxation is considered the real estate of residential destination that meets simultaneously the following conditions:
The taxable base of real estate is represented by its estimated value determined by territorial cadastral bodies (with some exceptions).
The wealth tax rate is 0.8% of the taxable base.
The wealth tax is payable by 25 December of the reporting year, based on the notification of payment presented by the territorial tax offices for the situation existing as at 1 November of the reporting year.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Patrimony received by Moldovan citizens by inheritance is not taxable. Moldovan tax law does not provide for separate gift taxes, such income being subject to general rules.
## Tax on immovable property
Property tax is imposed on property located in Moldova and owned both by Moldovan and foreign citizens. The tax applies to the estimated value of buildings, houses, apartments, and land and the rate depends on the location. The minimum rate is 0.05%, but the effective rate is determined by the representative local authorities annually.
The land tax rate for individuals depends on the land's destination (e.g. land for agriculture usage) and location, its cadastral index and surface, but cannot exceed MDL 30 for 100 square metres.
There are also separate rates for agricultural land with construction buildings on it (minimum rate of 0.1%, but the effective rate is determined by the representative local authorities annually).
Starting 1 January 2021, individuals may no longer benefit from a 15% discount at the full payment of the tax on immovable property by 30 June.
For certain categories of real estate, the local council can increase the real estate tax by up to 300%.
## Customs duties
Individuals are exempt from the payment of customs duties on goods whose customs value does not exceed 150 euros (EUR) per parcel of goods.
Individuals should pay import duties on goods imported by mail deliveries in business-to-consumer (B2C) commercial transactions. The provisions apply to goods of a commercial nature exceeding the quantitative limits established by the law or that have an intrinsic value exceeding EUR 150 per parcel of goods.

# Moldova
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year for CIT purposes is the calendar year. For new business entities, the fiscal year is considered the period beginning with the registration date until the end of the calendar year. Taxpayers have the right to choose a tax period different from the calendar one, subject to specific conditions.
For WHT and VAT purposes, the fiscal period is the calendar month starting the first day of the month. The VAT period for non-residents providing services through electronic networks to Moldovan resident individuals (B2C transactions) is the calendar quarter.
## Tax returns
An annual CIT return must be submitted to the MTA by the 25th day of the third month following the end of the tax period.
WHT and payroll liabilities must be declared and settled monthly, no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
Farming enterprises and individual entrepreneurs with an annual average number of employees not exceeding three and not registered as VAT payers must submit a unified annual tax return, provided certain conditions are met.
As of 1 January 2023, all taxpayers (except individuals) will be required to submit tax reports using automated electronic reporting methods.
### Adjusted tax returns
Taxpayers who discover that the tax return previously submitted contains an error are able to submit an adjusted tax return, provided that no written decision was issued by the tax authority in order to initiate a tax audit and the related tax period is not covered by a tax control.
As of 01 January 2025, taxpayers have the right to present the corrected tax return related to social security contributions no later than six years after the deadline for presenting the corrected tax return.
Late interest payments will not be applicable in amounts higher than the tax liability resulting from the adjusted tax return submitted, and no fines will be applicable if the tax duties are paid before the announcement of a tax audit.
Companies that have miscalculated the taxes, and this was not detected in the previous tax audit, are absolved from fines and late interest payments for violations identified within the repeated tax audit.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers must declare and pay the applicable CIT by the 25th day of the third month following the end of tax period. Taxpayers are also required to pay interim CIT, no later than the 25th day of each three months of the current tax period, amounts equal to 25% of either the total estimated value of the CIT due for the current fiscal period or the total value of the calculated CIT for the previous fiscal period.
Enterprises classified as micro, small, or medium, according to the criteria determined on the last day of the tax period according to the provisions of Law no. 179/2016, can pay the calculated CIT until the 25th day of the month following that in which dividends were paid, including in the form of stocks or shares, from the profit obtained in the tax periods 2023-2025 inclusive. The amount of CIT to be paid is determined by applying the pro rata ratio between the amount of CIT calculated for the tax period and the taxable income for the respective tax period.
### Fines and penalties
Among the most important fines and sanctions for non-compliance with applicable tax law, the following are worth mentioning:
Taxpayers who settle amounts as assessed by the MTA within three business days and have no other outstanding liabilities may benefit from a 50% reduction of the fines applied by the tax authorities.
In addition, certain special provisions regarding tax evasion apply. The term 'tax evasion' is defined under Moldovan criminal law as diminishing the tax liabilities by more than 50 medium forecasted salaries (MDL 805,000 in 2025) by means of including in accounting, tax, or financial documents deliberately distorted data on income or expenses or by hiding other objects of taxation. According to the Moldovan Criminal Code, legal entities can be punished for tax evasion with a fine up to MDL 400,000 and preclusion from performing certain activities. In case the amount of diminished tax liabilities exceeds 100 medium forecasted salaries (MDL 1,610,000 in 2025), legal entities can be punished for tax evasion with a fine up to MDL 800,000 and preclusion from performing certain activities or winding-up.
As of 15 April 2022, the amount of infringement considered insignificant and not triggering fines and penalties has been increased from MDL 100 to MDL 500 for individuals and from MDL 1,000 to MDL 5,000 for legal entities.
## Tax audit process
The rules governing the tax audit process are stated in the Tax Code. Generally, the tax audit duration and frequency depend on its type. For instance, a tax audit performed at the taxpayer premises should not exceed two months (with some exceptions) and should be performed no more than once per year for the same taxes and duties, except for specific circumstances provided by law.
Also, a tax audit can be performed on a more frequent basis within certain specific circumstances (e.g. refund of VAT and other taxes, reorganisation).
A repeated tax audit for already audited periods can be performed in a number of cases, for instance:
The anti-abuse rule comes into force on 1 January 2024. In this regard, for determining the taxpayer's fiscal obligations, the state tax service will not take into account or reclassify a transaction, action, or series of transactions or actions that, when considering all the relevant facts and circumstances, reflect a different situation or economic content than the one claimed by the taxpayer and is being undertaken with the aim of obtaining a fiscal advantage.
## Statute of limitations
Under the general tax rule, as of 01 January 2025, the limitation period can be extended for a period of more than six years following the last date set for the presentation of the tax return if the taxpayer has not submitted the tax return or requests the return of overpaid amounts or of the amounts which, according to the tax legislation, are to be returned.
In addition, tax authorities are currently focused on promoting voluntary compliance of the taxpayers.
## Rulings
Starting with 2017, the concept of advanced binding ruling has been introduced in the Moldovan tax law.
The binding ruling under the Moldova tax law represents an administrative act issued by the state tax service college in order to solve claims submitted by individuals and legal entities that perform entrepreneurial activity, regarding the applicability of the tax legislation on the future specific situations and/or transactions. The anticipated individual tax ruling is mandatory for MTA and other entities with tax administration attributions, provided certain conditions are met. The procedure of issuing and rejecting of advanced binding rulings is determined by the government.
The law also provides for the possibility of obtaining comfort letters. Taxpayers that inadequately computed tax liabilities due to incorrect written explanations issued by the MTA may not be subject to sanctions (i.e. fines and late-payment penalties). Tax liabilities may still be recomputed by the MTA. Written explanations are issued by the MTA free of charge and may remain valid for an indefinite period of time, unless cancelled by new legislation or other rulings. Such explanations are generally issued by the Moldovan competent authorities during a period of up to one month.

# Moldova
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Moldova is currently 20%. It is generally applied to local supplies of goods and services, as well as to import of goods and services through a reverse-charge mechanism.
Apart from the above, certain types of supplies are subject to reduced VAT rates. For instance, local supplies of bread and bakery products; milk and dairy products; transport and distribution of natural gases services; biofuels used for electricity, heating, and hot water production; and specific phytotechnical, horticultural, and zootechnical products are subject to the reduced 8% VAT rate.
The VAT rate for hotels, restaurants, and cafes decreased from 12% to 8% as of 10 August 2023.
As of 1 October 2021, during the national state of emergency, as declared by Parliament in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 212/2004 on the state of emergency, siege and war regime, and during the national public health state of emergency, as declared by the extraordinary national commission of public health, the VAT rate for above-mentioned activities was set at 6%.
Starting 15 April 2022, the e-book production and/or audio and electronic periodicals publications and/or audio, as well as editing services, services regarding copyright, and related rights, are VAT-exempted supply without deduction right.
The reverse-charge mechanism applies for supply of goods by insolvent economic operators. Thus, buyers are required to calculate and pay to the state budget the related VAT amounts on purchased goods.
The reverse-charge mechanism for VAT on imports of services has been implemented, so VAT payers are not required to pay VAT on such imports. The VAT amounts related to these transactions will be reflected as output VAT, and input VAT will be allowed for deduction. Non-VAT payers will be required to declare and pay VAT on the import of services.
Foreign supplies of digital services to Moldova-based individuals (B2C transactions) are taxed with a 20% VAT in Moldova. Subject to VAT are the non-resident companies performing business activity without having legal presence in Moldova:
A number of supplies are VAT-exempt with deduction right, including international transportation and exports of goods or services. Certain supplies are VAT-exempt without deduction right.
Starting from 1 March 2024, providers of crowdfunding services are VAT-exempted without the right of deduction.
As of 15 August 2024, the settlement of additional costs or revenues from balancing the system, according to point 707 of the Electricity Market Rules, approved by the National Agency for Energy Regulation, will not constitute objects of taxation with VAT.
### Input VAT
Input VAT incurred on acquisitions of goods and/or services may be deducted, provided it is incurred by a VAT-registered payer to perform VATable supplies within its business activity.
If input VAT relates to acquisitions destined to perform mixed supplies (i.e. both VATable and VAT-exempt ones), the input VAT deduction right is allowed on a pro-rata basis.
For cases where the monthly ratio determined between the exempted supplies without deduction right and total supplies is lower than 0.05, the VAT amount paid or to be paid related to mixed procurements is fully allowed for deduction. VAT amounts previously reflected as costs or expenses in the previous tax periods for mixed procurements are deducted in the last tax period if the annual pro rata ratio is lower than 0.05.
Starting 22 November 2023, taxpayers have the right to deduct the amount of VAT paid or to be paid on acquisitions, provided that they have available the tax receipt issued by the cash register and control equipment connected to the Automated Informational System ’Electronic Sales Monitoring‘ for purchases whose value on each receipt does not exceed MDL 2,000, including VAT, but not more than MDL 10,000 for a tax period, provided that they are paid by business payment card.
As of 01 January 2025:
### VAT refunds
Should a company register a deductible input VAT exceeding its output VAT, this balance can be partially refunded only if the company carries out a specific range of business activities (e.g. export supplies, international transportation services, production of bakery and dairy products, leasing activity). Otherwise, such VAT amount may be carried forward to the following months, offset against the company's future output VAT liabilities.
Additionally, VAT payers performing capital investments in Moldova may be entitled to refund the recoverable VAT related to these kinds of capital investments, provided such assets are used for product manufacturing, service supply, and execution of works.
Companies registered as VAT payers that register the transactions via the Automated Informational System (AIS) and/or issue tax receipts via cash machines with Electronic Sales Monitoring (ESM) have the right to refund VAT on purchased goods and services. The refund will be made for the excess amount of VAT on purchases (including VAT on imports) over the amount of VAT on supplies for transactions registered as of 1 January 2023.
The possibility to offset the VAT amounts allowed for refund against future obligations to the national public budget is also available, at the request of taxpayers not having debts to the national public budget.
### VAT administration
A company is required to register for VAT purposes if the total turnover within the last 12 consecutive months reached the threshold of MDL 1.2 million. Also, companies can follow voluntary registration for VAT purposes if they only intend to perform taxable supplies.
If the subject was previously registered as a VAT payer, the period of holding the status of VAT payer is not considered when assessing the registration threshold.
All VAT payers registered for VAT purposes must submit electronic tax returns. VAT liabilities must be declared and settled monthly no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
Non-resident legal entities providing services through electronic networks to Moldovan resident individuals or through which payment for services is made are required to follow a simplified registration procedure within the electronic system of the State Tax Service. Subsequently, they are required to calculate, report, and pay the related VAT amounts by the 25th day of the month following each quarter.
Generally, taxpayers are required to issue VAT invoices for the performed supplies, as well as to keep detailed records of their acquisitions and supplies in the correspondent VAT ledgers, according to a set of specific rules.
Starting 1 January 2021, the taxpayers performing supplies within public acquisitions are required to issue electronic tax invoices (except for the supplies of electricity, heat, natural gas, electronic communications services, and utilities).
In the case of deliveries of goods paid for using business payment cards, when using e-invoices, the deadline for the supplier to issue a tax invoice is the tenth calendar day of the month following that in which the delivery took place.
## Customs duties
Moldova’s current customs framework is regulated by the Customs Code, Law on Customs Tariff, international agreements concluded by Moldova to date, and by other legal acts.
The new Custom Code entered into force 1 January 2024.
Customs duties include customs procedural taxes, customs taxes, VAT, and excise duties.
### Customs regimes
The new Customs Code outlines the following regimes for placing goods:
### Customs valuation
Under Moldovan customs legislation, the customs valuation is conducted in accordance with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The customs value is determined based on one of the six provided valuation methods: transaction value, transaction value of identical goods or similar goods, unit price method, the calculated value of goods. If the first method is not applicable, then the second method should be applied and so forth.
### Preferential tariff treatment
Moldova has free trade arrangements (FTAs) with the most of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and is also a contracting state of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and is party to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), as well as party to EU-Moldova Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). Under these agreements, preferential tariff treatment is granted for specific categories of goods, depending on their origin and in accordance with the FTAs to which Moldova is a party.
Also, further to the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), the customs duties on goods originating in the other party are eliminated. The origin of goods can be certified by an EUR.1 movement certificate or an origin declaration.
Customs duties applicable on imports performed in the Republic of Moldova are eliminated, except for products free of customs duties within the limits of the tariff quotas. In case these limits are exceeded, the most-favoured-nation customs duty rate shall apply.
Customs duties applicable on imports performed from the EU are eliminated, except for the following products:
Elimination of the customs duties on some specific categories of goods will be gradually made.
### Favourable tariff treatment
A favourable tariff treatment presumes a reduction or an exemption from customs duty upon import of specific goods into Moldova, depending on their type or final destination. This is governed by domestic customs law or international agreements to which Moldova is a party.
### Customs administration
Moldovan customs legislation provides for:
The Customs Service of Moldova uses procedures for issuing binding tariff and binding origin information. Additionally, companies may use the electronic procedure of customs clearance for the export of goods, as well as specific simplified customs procedures.
## Excise duties
Excise duties apply to the production and import of cars, tobacco, alcohol, petrol and lubricants, and other goods. Special excise rates for each type of excisable goods are established in the Tax Code. The rates are widely variable and are based on multiple factors. The excise duty rates are generally established as a percentage applied to the value of goods or as a fixed amount for a certain quantity of excisable goods. However, for specific types of excisable duties, mixed excise duty rates are applicable.
The following are subject to excise duties, unless there is a specific exemption provided:
Under certain circumstances, excise duty exemptions may apply. Some excise-liable goods are subject to mandatory excise stamp marking and labelling.
The deadline for payment of excise duties for excisable goods placed in tax warehouse is the 25th day of the month following the dispatch of excisable goods from the tax warehouse.
As of 2025, excise duties will not be levied on fur clothing.
## Tax on immovable property
The maximum and specific tax rate for determining the real estate tax and land tax have been abolished.
The local council can increase the real estate tax by up to 300% for the following categories of real estate:
The specific tax rates for real estate / land tax are determined annually by the representative and deliberative authorities of the local government.
For legal entities and individuals registered as entrepreneurs, 25 September is the deadline for submitting the calculation and payment of the tax on real estate acquired before 31 August. For real estate acquired after that date, the deadline is 25 March of the tax period following the reporting one.
In the event of an owner change during the fiscal year, the previous owner may request recalculation of the real estate tax in proportion to the period in which they were subject to taxation.
## Transfer duties
Transfer duties may be applied for notary acts performed by authorised notaries and other persons empowered by law. Transfer duties are applicable to notary-authenticated acts such as sale-purchase agreements for  land; transfers of houses into private property; alienation agreements of houses, apartments, garages, and other constructions; authentication of mortgage agreements; and other evaluative contracts.
## Stamp duties
According to the law on state duty, stamp duty (state duty) is the amount charged by specifically authorised state bodies from individuals and legal entities for the exercise of certain actions or issuance of legal documents of interest to them.
Stamp duties may be applied for, but not limited to, the following:
## Payroll taxes
Salaries and other remunerations provided by an employer to its employees are subject to 12% personal income tax (PIT).
Also, there are available deductions, each resident taxpayer being allowed to claim annual allowances. In 2025, allowances are set at:
| Type of allowance | Amount of the allowance (MDL) |
| --- | --- |
| Personal allowance (1) | 29,700 |
| Major personal allowance (2) | 34,620 |
| Spouse’s major allowance (3) | 21,780 |
| Allowances for dependant | 9,900 |
| Major allowances for dependant | 21,780 |
Notes
1. This allowance is granted only to Moldovan resident taxpayers whose annual taxable income (with some exceptions) does not exceed MDL 360,000.
2. Individuals can opt for this allowance only provided certain conditions are fulfilled.
3. Individuals may opt for this allowance provided the spouse is eligible for the major personal allowance and does not use it in the period concerned.
All payroll taxes are reported through a unified payroll tax return by the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
## Social security contributions (SSC)
Starting 1 January 2021, new provisions regarding SSC are in force. Thus, mandatory SSC due by the employer and employee are combined into a single 24% rate (with some exceptions) and is fully borne by the employer. The rate of SSC is applied on employees' gross salary, meal tickets, and other recompense. For some specific sectors (public, aviation, agriculture), other rates are applicable.
As of 1 January 2023, the following changes became effective regarding the calculation of the SSC:
The legislation provides an annual fixed SSC for other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 20,518 applicable for 2025).
Companies report their SSC liabilities on a monthly basis (with certain exceptions) through the unique payroll tax return. The SSC due must be transferred by the employer to the budget no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
## Health insurance contributions
The mandatory health insurance contribution is computed as a percentage of wages and other remuneration and is established at 9% fully borne by the employee. The legislation also provides for an annual fixed amount of health insurance contribution paid by other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 12,636 applicable in 2025).
The mandatory health insurance contribution is declared on a monthly basis by the employer through the unique payroll tax return.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Resident companies generally must calculate their taxable base for CIT purposes on their worldwide income. Permanent establishments (PEs), unlike resident companies, are only required to calculate their taxable base for CIT purposes on income sourced in Moldova.
The CIT rate is 12%.
Individual entrepreneurs are subject to a 12% CIT rate on their total income.
Farming enterprises are subject to a 7% CIT rate.
Small and medium companies that are not registered as VAT payers and correspond to specific criteria may opt for a special CIT regime of 4% on their aggregated income determined for accounting purposes, except for sources of income considered as non-taxable under the general tax regime.
Shareholders of companies classified as small or medium-sized enterprises that hold more than 25% of the value or number of shares or voting rights in more than three small and medium-sized enterprises must determine for which company the general tax regime (i.e. 12%) should be applied.
## Local income taxes
There is no separate CIT at the local level. CIT is distributed between the national state budget and local budgets depending on the establishment of the entity and its subdivisions in accordance with the existing rules.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
According to Moldovan tax law, a tax resident is a legal entity organised or managed in Moldova or that has its main place of business in Moldova. In practice, tax residency is determined by the place of incorporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Due to the regulatory environment in Moldova, as well as certain difficulties in operating a PE in Moldova, foreign enterprises operating through a PE in Moldova are not common.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
The threshold value of fixed assets recognised for tax purposes is established to MDL 12,000.
For entities that apply the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the calculation and deduction of depreciation related to the right to use fixed assets that are the subject of an operational leasing contract is performed by the lessee.
As of 2025, all legal entities, except for legal entities that carry out financial insurance/reinsurance activities provided for in section К of the Activities classifier in the Moldovan economy have the right to apply the accelerated depreciation method for the first year of putting the fixed asset into operation.
The amount of amortisation of the fixed asset to be deducted is determined as follows:
Intangible assets are subject to CIT amortisation according to the straight-line method.
## Goodwill
According to the National Accounting Standards, goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset. However, the Moldovan Tax Code does not expressly provide for specific rules regarding CIT deduction.
## Start-up expenses
According to the National Accounting Standards, start-up expenses incurred by companies (e.g. stamp taxes paid upon company registration, drawing up of registration documents, manufacture of stamp) are not recognised as an intangible asset. Therefore, such expenses are to be treated as current expenses.
## Interest expenses
Different CIT deductibility rules apply for interest on loans used for carrying out operational activities and for loans used for investment activities performed on an occasional basis.
As a general rule, deductions for interest expenses are allowed for CIT purposes, provided such expenses are deemed as ordinary and necessary for carrying out the activities of the business. Expenses should also be incurred for the purposes of obtaining taxable income and justified by adequate backup documentation.
If the interest paid by a Moldovan company relates to its operational or day-to-day activities, the related expenses are deductible for CIT purposes, taking into account the following:
If interest relates to an investment activity, the interest expense is deductible for CIT purposes within the limit of the income derived from the investment.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible for CIT purposes, provided certain conditions are fulfilled and justifying documents are made available.
Starting 01 January 2025,  the threshold of bad debt with an expired statute of limitations has been increased from MDL 1,000 to MDL 2,000.
The deduction of bad debts up to MDL 2,000, for which the statute of limitation has exceeded three years, is allowed.
## Charitable contributions
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties related to CIT, related to other taxes and due payments to the state budget, or for violations of legal acts are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
CIT is not deductible for CIT purposes.
Other taxes are generally deductible for CIT purposes, except those paid on behalf of another person.
## Other significant items
Among others, the following expenses are also generally deductible for CIT purposes:
Starting with 1 January 2024, the following additional deductions are allowed:
### Non-deductible expenses
Among others, the following expenses are generally not deductible for CIT purposes:
## Fiscal losses
Fiscal losses may only be carried forward for five consecutive years following the year the losses were incurred, provided the company records taxable income. If the company recorded fiscal losses for more than one year, such losses are carried forward in the order in which they arose. Fiscal losses are recorded on off-balance-sheet accounts.
Losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Moldovan legal entity generally may deduct expenses related to payments to foreign affiliates to the extent that these amounts were actually paid and are not in excess of what it would have paid to an unrelated entity (i.e. arm’s length). However, the payer is required to hold documentary evidence for the actually performed transactions. Certain types of expenses may follow general rules of deductibility that would limit their amount (e.g. interest expenses on loan agreements).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
### General rules on transactions with related parties
With reference to the transactions carried out by Moldovan companies with related parties, Moldovan tax law provides the following specific provisions:
In accordance with Moldovan tax law, a company is considered the taxpayer’s related party if one of the following conditions exists:
From a tax perspective, control is the ownership (either directly or through one or more related parties) of 50% or more in value of the capital or voting power of one of the companies. For this purpose, an individual will be treated as owning all equity interest that is directly or indirectly owned by members of their family.
### Transfer pricing rules
The Republic of Moldova recently formally introduced its first transfer pricing regulations, which follow the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
Law no. 356, dated 29 December 2022, introduced the transfer pricing concept into the Moldovan Tax Code along with general rules related to transfer pricing reporting and documentation requirements.
The legislation enters into force on 1 January 2024. Further, on 09 February 2024, the Moldovan Authorities  approved the secondary legislation, containing guidance on the contents of the transfer pricing documentation and details regarding the application of the law.
Multinational enterprises operating in Moldova and Moldova-headquartered groups (limited only to transactions between resident taxpayers, where one or both taxpayers are residents of free economic zones / information technology parks or they apply different rates and/or have different taxable bases for corporate income tax) should review their related-party transactions and documentation in view of compliance with the arm’s-length principle and further transfer pricing documentation requirements. Where appropriate, such groups should consider adjusting their operational and pricing models in seeking to avoid potential transfer pricing disputes with the Moldovan tax authorities and related sanctions due to non-compliance with the new regulations.
### Materiality thresholds and other legal requirements
The Moldovan government has set two materiality thresholds to be considered with regard to taxpayers that fall under transfer pricing requirements:
### Documentation requirements
A Moldovan taxpayer must prepare two types of documents for transfer pricing purposes:
### Penalties
According to the new legislation, the following penalties will apply:
As of 1 January 2025, the concept of ‘advance price agreement’ will come into force. A decision issued by the Moldovan Tax Authorities will establish and justify the conditions and the methods of formation of transfer prices during a determined period related to a controlled transaction or transactions carried out between related parties.
## Thin capitalisation
Moldovan tax law does not provide for a specific thin capitalisation regime.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Moldovan tax law does not contain CFC provisions.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Branches
Foreign legal entities are able to register branches in Moldova that do not have legal personality and may carry out commercial activity.
A branch is a separate subdivision of the legal entity, located outside its premises, having the appearance of permanence, its own management, and the material endowment necessary to carry out, wholly or partially, the activities of the parent entity.
Moldovan law states that foreign entities may carry out activity through branches in the Republic of Moldova, subject to their registration in the public registers and obtaining the permissive documents, where the case. The foreign parent entity is responsible for the liabilities arising from the activities of its branch in the Republic of Moldova.
The modernised Civil Code modifies the concept of 'subsidiary', which, in contrast to the branch, is an entity with legal personality. The law provides that references in the legislation in force to the subsidiary or representative office of a legal entity are considered references to the branch of the legal entity until the legislation is aligned with the corporate provisions of the modernised Civil Code.
## Representative offices
Starting with 1 March 2019, the concept of 'representative office' has been excluded from Moldovan legislation. The transitory legal provisions state that all representative offices registered before 1 March 2019 will be considered as branches of the parent companies. In addition, all references in the national legislation to representative offices will be considered as references to branches of legal entities.
By 1 January 2024, legal entities that registered in the Republic of Moldova branches and representative offices are required to bring their articles of incorporation/regulations of the branches and representative offices in accordance with the provisions of the modernised Civil Code and operate the necessary modifications in the state Register of legal entities.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax paid in any foreign country, if this income is subject to taxation in Moldova, is allowed for tax credit, provided that the taxpayer submits a document that justifies payment (withholding) of the income tax outside of Moldova, certified by the competent body of the respective foreign country, with its translation into the state language.
The amount of tax credit for any taxable year should not exceed the amount that would have been estimated at the rate applicable in Moldova with regard to this income.
A tax paid in a foreign country should be creditable for the year in which the income is taxable in Moldova.
## Free entrepreneurial zones (FEZs)
FEZs are territories where domestic and foreign investors can carry out entrepreneurial activities on preferential terms (i.e. favourable tax, customs, visa, and other regimes). There are currently seven FEZs in Moldova.
The following types of activities may be carried out in an FEZ:
There is also an international free port (Giurgiulesti International Free Port) and airport (Marculesti International Free Airport) with status similar to FEZs that can benefit from specific tax and customs incentives.
### FEZ incentives
The following CIT incentives for FEZ investors are in place:
CIT incentives will be available until 01 July 2034, or until the free economic zone ceases to operate, whichever comes first. These benefits apply to individuals or legal entities registered as residents of the free economic zone by 31 December 31 2023, and are contingent upon the size of investments made by 01 July 2024. The government will determine how these tax benefits are granted through the regional state aid scheme for enterprises in free economic zones, in accordance with the regulations set by the Competition Council and subject to certain conditions.
According to the customs provisions, goods are introduced into the FEZ with no VAT or customs duty and are not subject to economic policy measures, according to specific criteria. However, certain taxes in specific situations might be incurred by residents of the FEZ.
Individuals or legal entities registered as residents of the free zone by 31 December 2023, are permitted to engage in activities under the customs regime regulated by Free Economic Zones until 01 January 2034, or until the specific free zone ceases operations, whichever comes first.
## Law on information technology (IT) parks
Starting 2017, the law on IT parks entered into force. The law provides for certain tax incentives for the IT parks’ residents.
Under this law, residents of the parks could be legal persons or individuals registered in the Republic of Moldova as conducting entrepreneurial activity that carry out as their principal activity one or more of the following activities:
Starting 12 February 2024, the following new types of activity eligible for IT park were introduced:
The residents of the IT parks are subject to a single tax that includes:
For the rest of the taxes, standard applicable tax treatment shall be applied.
In this context, the principal activity is that which generates 70% of a park resident’s sales revenue.
The single tax of 7% of sales revenue, but not less than the minimum amount due per employee, is to be calculated and paid monthly by each park resident. The minimum amount of single tax per employee is set at 30% of the national average forecasted salary for that year (e.g. MDL 16,100 for 2025).

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The legislation and the approach of the state authorities in Moldova related to corporate taxation have been and are expected to be subject to changes.
Taxpayers should seek professional advice on specific issues, given that only limited interpretations have been issued by the MTA.
## US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Moldova applies FACTA requirements under an intergovernmental agreement (IGA Model 2), signed with the United States on 26th of November 2014.
FACTA compliance has been in force since 21st of January 2016.
## Association Agreement with the European Union
Moldova ratified the Association Agreement with the EU on 27 June 2014, which fully entered into force on 1 July 2016. As of 23 June 2022, Moldova holds EU candidate status, aiming for EU accession by 2030.
On 14 December 2023, the European Council approved the commencement of accession negotiations.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Individuals are allowed to credit their foreign income tax paid against their Moldovan tax liabilities (an official confirmation issued by the relevant foreign tax authority is required), but only within the limits of the tax rate that would be applicable in Moldova on tax due for the year concerned.
## Tax treaties
The Moldovan tax law expressly provides that the DTTs prevail over national provisions. The only exception refers to cases where the domestic norms provide for more favourable tax rates (i.e. in such circumstances, the domestic rates apply). Thus, WHT might be reduced.
For DTT purposes, the non-resident has to present its certificate of fiscal residency prior to the payment of income. The certificate should meet certain criteria.
Moldovan tax authorities and taxpayers have to use Commentaries to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention to clarify tax issues related to the applicability of DTTs.

## Temporary visas
Foreign nationals generally require entry visas to enter Moldova, with exceptions for certain countries, including EU member states.
Moldova issues long-stay ‘D’ visas for extended stays, which are renewable. Citizens of some countries may also need an invitation from Moldova immigration authorities.
## Work permits
Foreign employees working in Moldova have to obtain the residence permit for work purposes. This permit is obtained based on decisions granting the right to stay for work purposes in Moldova issued by relevant Moldovan state authorities.
The law provides for simplified immigration compliance procedures in case of:
## Residence permits
Foreign nationals staying in Moldova for more than 90 days within a six-month period must obtain a residence permit. Non-compliance can result in entry bans and penalties.
Specific exemptions apply to professional sellers, providers of contractual services, and independent professionals from a European Union member state.
## Exemptions for non-resident employees in Moldovan companies
As of 2023, certain categories of non-resident workers are allowed to work without obtaining a visa, the right to stay, or a provisional residence permit. This applies to those who have been initially registered and assigned a state identification number for individuals (IDNP) and an electronic identity, and meet cumulatively the following conditions:
Failure to meet at least one of these conditions results in the need to comply with the general conditions for work as outlined in this chapter.
Since 2022, Moldova has recognised EU issued electronic signatures. Implementation of these mechanisms is ongoing.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment income
Employee gross income includes basic pay, overtime pay, supplementary pay, awards and bonuses, compensation from unused holiday or vacation time, compensation for dismissal, as well as benefits in kind (e.g. housing allowances, compensation for school fees, food, and personal travel expenses).
Mandate relationships between the legal entity and the administrator will be recognised for tax purposes as employment relationships and taxed similarly to salary.

Moldovan tax law provides for special rules (i.e. tax exemption) regarding the income obtained by members of diplomatic missions, and other missions accredited as such, and their personnel.
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax (CGT). Capital gains in the case of private individuals are equal to 50% of the difference between the sale price and the purchase price (i.e. including all costs related to the acquisition of capital assets) and have to be included in the gross income of the individual for the year when the income is obtained.
In addition, under certain conditions, capital gains derived from the sale of a permanent abode are non-taxable.
New provisions on capital gains entered into force on 1 January 2023.
Starting with January 2024, capital gain or loss will not be recognised in the case of:
As of 01 January 2025, in case of transactions involving shares acquired at a preferential price or for free under a stock option plan, the capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales price (the amount received or income obtained) and the shares' basis value.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The assessment of tax residency is important for PIT purposes. According to Moldovan tax law, a person is considered a Moldovan resident if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:
As such, foreign citizens become Moldovan tax residents if they stay in Moldova for at least 183 days during the fiscal year (which corresponds to the calendar year).
Double tax treaties (DTTs) concluded by Moldova with other countries may affect the determination of tax residence in specific cases.
