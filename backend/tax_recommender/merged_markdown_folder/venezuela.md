## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories may be valued at cost or the lower of cost or market value. Any method generally accepted for accounting purposes can be accepted for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxable as ordinary income, and capital losses are deductible from ordinary income. Note that capital losses resulting from the sale of stock, capital reduction, or liquidation of a company are only deductible if they meet one of the following conditions:
At present, the tax law contains two different rulings relevant to the deductibility of losses incurred through operations on the Venezuelan Stock Market, one of which has been described above. The second ruling pertains to income obtained from operations on the local market. This income is subject to a final 1% tax that is withheld at the source. Losses in this kind of operation are not deductible against other income. Corporate shareholders not domiciled in Venezuela may not deduct such losses from other taxable income other than dividends arising from Venezuelan sources.
Gains upon liquidation or reduction of capital are taxable to the liquidating entity.
## Dividend income
A dividend tax is levied at a flat rate of 34% on the positive difference between book income and tax income generated after 2000. Book income is understood to be that approved at a shareholders’ meeting and based on the financial statements prepared pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To determine the applicable difference, a last in first out (LIFO) method applies. The tax is triggered when a dividend is paid and shall be remitted via withholding. Withholding is to be made at the moment a dividend is declared or credited to the account of a recipient. The 34% (domestic) rate can be mitigated under tax treaties.
Dividends obtained from companies incorporated or resident abroad or incorporated abroad and resident in Venezuela are taxed at a flat 34% rate.
### Stock dividends
Dividends of stock are subject to payment of the aforementioned dividend tax. Moreover, stock dividends are subject to an advanced payment of dividend tax equivalent to 1% of the dividend distributed. Stock dividends have no cost for tax purposes.
## Interest income
Unless the debtor can prove otherwise, any sum paid by a debtor in excess of the principal is deemed to be interest. As a general rule, interest is sourced in Venezuela if it is derived from activities carried out in Venezuela or from property located in Venezuela. Specifically, interest is deemed to be derived from activities carried out in Venezuela if the loan principal is used or enjoyed in the country. Interest received by non-resident corporations is therefore subject to Venezuelan income tax if the loan is granted or invested in Venezuela.
Interest paid on loans granted by non-resident financial institutions is subject to a final withholding tax (WHT) at source at a rate of 4.95% on gross income. Interest paid to other non-resident legal entities is subject to tax at a rate of 34% applied to 95% of the gross income.
## Royalty income
Royalties derived by non-residents are subject to income tax on 90% of gross receipts in the case of royalties and similar payments, other than those derived from mining activities, resulting in an effective WHT rate of 30.6%.
## Foreign income
Extraterritorial income is subject to Venezuelan CIT based on the concept of worldwide income taxation, according to which:
### Foreign technical assistance and services
### International fiscal transparency regime
A regime of international fiscal transparency is created for the purpose of establishing special standards of fiscal control, governing capital investments in countries classified as a JLFT, or tax havens. Under certain conditions, a Venezuelan taxpayer may be required to recognise income generated in its JLFT subsidiary on an accrual basis in its tax return.
## Inflation adjustment
A system for the adjustment of non-monetary assets, non-monetary liabilities, and shareholder’s equity has been established. ‘Non-monetary assets’ include land, construction, machinery, vehicles, installations, inventories, and investments other than in securities (e.g. bonds and stocks).
There are two phases to the adjustments: (i) initial adjustments and (ii) annual adjustments. Both phases are mandatory adjustments for taxpayers engaged in commercial and industrial operations, and in the exploitation of mines and hydrocarbons. The annual adjustment is optional for taxpayers performing non-business activities.
The following taxpayers are excluded from the inflation adjustment: (i) taxpayers engaged in banking, financial, insurance, and reinsurance activities and (ii) taxpayers designated by the tax authorities as ‘special taxpayers’.
For those taxpayers subject to inflation accounting for tax purposes, the inflation adjustment is based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).
### Initial adjustment
The initial adjustment on depreciable fixed assets requires a registration tax of 3% on the amount of the adjustment.
The initial adjustment must be filed at the closing date of any fiscal year ending after 1 January 1993. This adjustment is applicable to all non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities.
The initial adjustment is calculated by applying the variations between the NCPI prevailing in the month in which the non-monetary assets were acquired and the month corresponding to the initial adjustment. Assets acquired before 1950 are deemed to have been acquired in January 1950.
A registry tax of 3% is applied exclusively to the initial revaluation adjustment of depreciable fixed assets. For payment, taxpayers must be registered with the Asset Revaluation Registry, maintained by the tax administration. The resulting tax may be paid in three consecutive annual instalments, beginning on the date of registration.
Companies in the pre-operating stage, deemed to end with the first invoice, must determine and pay a 3% tax once the pre-operating period has ended.
Depreciation or amortisation on the revaluation adjustment is allowed, based on the original estimated life of the asset.
### Annual adjustment
The annual adjustment is applied each year in determining taxable income. The adjustment factor must be applied to the following balance sheet items at the closing date of the fiscal year. The resulting adjustment will increase or decrease taxable income.
| Balance sheet items | Adjustment factor | Tax effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-monetary assets: |  |  |
| Inventories (including inventories in transit) (2) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Increase taxable income |
| Fixed assets (3) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Increase taxable income |
| Other assets, trademarks, patents, production licences, other rights, and investments in stock not registered in the *Superintendencia Nacional de Valores* (SNV) and deferred charges (except interest). | Annual variation of the NCPI | Increase taxable income |
| Investments in shares registered in the SNV | Adjusted to the share market value at the end of the year | Increase taxable income |
| Non-monetary liabilities: |  |  |
| Deferred credits (except interest) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Decrease taxable income |
| Equity: |  |  |
| Tax initial equity (1) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Decrease taxable income |
Notes
1. Tax initial equity is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities at the beginning of the tax year, less accounts receivable from administrators, affiliated companies, and related companies. In order to determine the initial tax equity, assets not located in the country, as well as goods, debts, and liabilities entirely applied to the production of deemed, exempt, or exonerated income, are excluded.
2. Inventories are to be valued at historical cost for purposes of applying the NCPI. The provisions of the VITL detail the procedures for applying the NCPI. The revaluation of inventories in the tax year is included as part of the initial inventories of the following year.
3. The annual revaluation adjustment of fixed assets is considered part of the cost when the assets are sold.
More recently, there has been a delay in publishing the NCPI. To date, the last NCPI published is that corresponding to May 2022.
Net losses arising from the annual adjustment that have not been offset cannot be carried forward.
Gains or losses originating from the adjustment of accounts receivable or investments, as well as debts and liabilities in foreign currency or with a re-adjustability clause, are deemed to be carried out during the fiscal year in which they become demandable, collected, or paid, whichever comes first.

| Payments to non-domiciled international transportation companies (4) | N/A | N/A | T2 on 5 | N/A |
Notes
1. WHTs constitute prepayments against final tax liabilities as determined by the income tax return when filed.
2. Includes commissions earned in instances other than through a dependent relationship (e.g. employer/employee). Commissions are subject to withholdings in the same manner as salaries and wages.
3. The rates for non-residents are similar to those rates applicable for payments to a non-domiciled corporation not resident in a treaty country and rendering services from abroad with no PE in Venezuela.
4. Excludes payments exempted under international shipping agreements.
6. Domestic income tax withholding rules do not provide for withholding rates in case of resident beneficiaries. Although, in general, no withholding should be applied, a case-by-case review may be necessary.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Social security contributions
Below is a chart containing the main contributions established to finance social security.
| Contributions | Employee Contribution Basis | Contribution basis (cap) | Employer´s contributions (%) | Employee´s contributions (%) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mandatory Social Security Regime Contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to five minimum salaries for urban workers | 9, 10, or 11 | 4 | (1, 2, 5) |
| Employment Benefit Regime Contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to ten minimum salaries for urban workers | 2 | 0.5 | (1) |
| Housing Regime Contribution | Total monthly (or integral) salary | No cap | 2 | 1 | (4, 5) |
| Employee Training Contribution (INCES) | Annual profit sharing bonus | No cap | 2 | 0.5 | (3) |
| Workplace Prevention, Conditions and Environment Contribution (LOPCYMAT) | Total salaries paid to employees | No cap is established. | 0.75 to 10 | N/A | (6, 7) |
Notes
1. Minimum monthly salary increased to VES 130 as of 15 March 2022.
2. According to the current system, the employer's contribution to social security will depend on the company's risk qualification (minimum risk, middle risk, or maximum risk).
3. Regarding *Instituto Nacional de Capacitación y Educación Socialista* (INCES) contribution, the employer must contribute 2% of the total wages and salaries paid to employees.
4. According to the *Ley Orgánica del Sistema de Seguridad Social* (LOSSS), the general rule for contribution basis for the new systems cannot exceed ten minimum salaries. The transition rules establish a contribution basis of five metropolitan minimum salaries for urban workers for social security purposes. No cap is expressly established in the transition rules for the housing system and work, security, and health regime.
5. The basis of calculation of the housing contributions is the ‘integral salary’. The integral salary is a concept established in the Organic Labour Law, and it comprises the following payments: commissions, gratifications, profit sharing, bonuses, vacation bonus as well as surcharges for holidays, overtime, night shifts, among others, all of which are made to the employee and correspond to the services rendered by the individual.
6. Contributions to be made to this regime are exclusively for the employer and vary depending on the risk associated to the company. A company's risk is to be determined by the *Instituto Nacional de Prevención,* *Salud y Seguridad Laborales* (INPSASEL).
7. *Ley Orgánica de Prevención, Condiciones y Medio Ambiente de Trabajo* (LOPCYMAT) regulations do not establish a cap for the contribution. However, as mentioned, the LOSSS establishes a maximum of ten minimum urban salaries. For this reason, there are several contrary interpretations on whether a cap should be applied in this case.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Federal VAT (*Impuesto al Valor Agregado* or IVA), is a one-time tax payable by the ultimate consumer of all types of products and services.
In general, VAT is payable on all sales, rental, and importation of goods, and rendering of services executed or used in the country, although a number of significant exceptions are provided by law.
The rate may change every year, within the range of 8% to 16.5%. The current general rate is 16%.
A 15% VAT applies to the sale and imports of luxury products (e.g. vehicles valued at 40,000 United States dollars [USD] or more, motorcycles valued at USD 20,000 or more, nickel or token game machines, aircraft used for recreational or sport purposes, jewellery valued at USD 300 or more).
An additional tax rate, subject to modification by the National Executive and ranging from 5% to 25%, is applicable to goods and supply of services paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. To date, the applicable rate has not been published.
The newly introduced additional tax rate will be effective as of 30 continuous days following the publication of the Official Gazette by which the National Executive is to establish the applicable rate.
An 8% VAT applies to the following transactions:
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Individual and corporate special taxpayers are subject to tax when their worth is equal to or higher than TU 150 million. Resident individuals and entities in the terms of the Constitutional Law are subject to tax on their total net worth, regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced, whereas non-resident taxpayers or nationals non-resident in the country are subject to tax on assets located and rights enforceable in the country. Foreign persons with a permanent establishment (PE) in the country are subject to tax on the total net worth attributable to the PE regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced.
Under the Constitutional Law that enacted the high net wealth tax for special taxpayers, the circumstances determining individual tax residence have been enhanced with respect to those provided in the Venezuelan Income Tax Law and the Master Tax Code
The annual tax period end has been provided to end on 30 September of each year. The first taxable period was that ending 30 September 2019. The applicable rate is 0.25%. The taxable basis is comprised by the sum of the total assets’ value less liabilities and excluding the value of burdens and encumbrances, as well as tax-exempt assets and rights.
The return filing and payment of the tax shall be executed from 1 October and 30 November of each year. The tax shall be reported pursuant to the standards provided for such purposes in the tax authorities’ website.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
The estate and gift tax (*Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones* [EGT]) is imposed on all persons that are beneficiaries of an estate, inheritance, or gift of immovable property, rights, or shares located within Venezuela. The EGT is territorial in the sense that it is levied on Venezuelan estates and gifts, irrespective of the residence, domicile, or nationality of the beneficiary. EGT is imposed on the value of all property inherited or received from the descendant or donor (less certain liabilities and expenses), which must be appraised based on current market values at the time of the death of the descendant or at the time of the gift. The tax rate varies depending on the degree of kinship between the descendant of the donor and the beneficiary.
## Property taxes
The Urban Property Tax is a local or municipal tax payable by any person who owns property rights or any other real rights on urban real estates. The taxable basis is the value of the urban real estate. For these purposes, the fair market value of the real estate is provided as a point of reference. The applicable rate varies according to each municipality.
## Tax on Large Financial Transactions
The partial amendment of the Law included new categories of taxpayers subject to tax a different tax rate as follows:
The Administrative Ruling SNAT/2022/000013, published in the Official Gazette N° 42,339 dated 17 March 2022, provides for the designation of special taxpayers as collection agents of the tax for payments received in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela without mediation of the financial system.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Venezuela) has a privileged location on the Northern Coast of South America, which facilitates access to the East Coast of the United States, to the Panama Canal, to Central America, and to the Caribbean. The country has a surface of 916,445 square kilometres and is the seventh largest country in Latin America. The official language of Venezuela is Spanish, and the currency is the bolívar (VES).
Venezuela is defined as a federal and democratic state, with Caracas as the capital. There are three levels of government: the national, the state, and the municipal governments. The legal system is based on the Roman law and the Napoleonic Code. The main tenets of the legal system are embodied in the Constitution of 1999, congressional laws, executive decrees, and the legal standards of the Republic.
Venezuela is highly dependent on oil revenues. Due to the country’s current economic environment, a decrease of 26.8% in the gross domestic product (GDP) was experienced for the first quarter of 2019.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Corporations resident in Venezuela are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) on their Venezuelan and foreign-source income, whereas corporations resident abroad with a permanent establishment (PE) in Venezuela are levied CIT on only their Venezuelan and foreign-source income attributable to said PE. Corporations are able to claim any similar taxes paid abroad on foreign-source income as a tax credit. Non-resident corporations without a PE are subject to CIT only on Venezuela-source income.
Corporate income is taxed at the following progressive rates based on tax units (TU) (*see below*) (i.e. Tariff 2):
| Taxable income (TU) | | Rate (%) | Subtract (TU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 2,000 | 15 | 0 |
| 2,000 | 3,000 | 22 | 140 |
| 3,000 | - | 34 | 500 |
## Tax units (TU)
The 1994 Income Tax Law reform established the concept of a taxable unit as an element that reduces the negative effects created by inflation on the determination of the tax rates. The tax code established the initial TU at 1 bolívar fuerte (VEF), with annual basis adjustments according to the variation on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the previous year. This parameter for adjustment has been abrogated in the 2020 Master Tax Code. For 2022, the TU value, under the new currency expression enacted in October 2021, is 0.40 bolívar soberano (VES). For 2023, the TU published value is VES 9.
## Additional rates and considerations
Income for oil exploitation and certain related activities is taxed at a flat rate of 50%. Related activities are comprised of those such as refinery, transportation, and purchases for the exports of hydrocarbons and by-products for exploitation. Joint venture corporations are also subject to a 50% CIT rate.
The above-indicated regime does not apply to corporations engaged in the exploration and exploitation of non-associated gas (and the processing, refining, transportation, distribution, commercialisation, and exportation of the gas and its components) or companies exclusively engaged in the refining of hydrocarbons or improvement of extra heavy oil, which are subject to Tariff 2.
Net income from banking, financial, insurance, and re-insurance activities carried out by entities domiciled in Venezuela is subject to a 40% flat rate.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Resident individuals are subject to tax on their worldwide income.
Foreign resident individuals with a fixed base in Venezuela must pay taxes on their income of national or foreign source attributable to said base.
Non-resident individuals pay taxes on their income whenever the cause or origin of such income lies within Venezuela.
## Personal income tax rates
Resident individuals are subject to tax using graduated rates. The annual income tax, before credits, is calculated using the following tax rate table (i.e. Tariff No. 1).
| Range of taxable income in tax units (TU) | | Tax rate (%) | Deduction (TU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 1,000 | 6 | 0 |
| 1,000 | 1,500 | 9 | 30 |
| 1,500 | 2,000 | 12 | 75 |
| 2,000 | 2,500 | 16 | 155 |
| 2,500 | 3,000 | 20 | 255 |
| 3,000 | 4,000 | 24 | 375 |
| 4,000 | 6,000 | 29 | 575 |
| 6,000 |  | 34 | 875 |
Income for non-resident individuals arising from non-business professional activities is subject to tax at 34% on 90% of the gross payments. Salary and other income received by non-residents for services performed in Venezuela are subject to a flat 34% tax, withheld at source.
### Tax units (TU)
The 1994 Income Tax Law reform established the concept of a taxable unit as an element that reduces the negative effects created by inflation on the determination of the tax rates. The tax code established the initial TU at 1 bolívar fuerte (VEF), formerly with annual basis adjustments according to the variation on the consumer price index (CPI) from the previous year. This parameter for adjustment was abrogated in the 2020 Master Tax Code. For 2022, the TU value, under the new currency expression enacted in October 2021, is 0.40 bolívar soberano (VES). For 2023, the TU published value is VES 9.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in Venezuela.

# Venezuela
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Taxable period
Individual taxpayers earning wages and salaries must file their tax returns on a calendar-year basis, whereas taxpayers engaged in commercial activities, industry activities, or services are allowed to choose a period with duration other than that of the calendar year (12-month period). Exceptions are permitted (e.g. when an individual ceases all business).
## Tax returns
The Venezuelan income tax return should be filed by 31 March, or at the date established in the corresponding calendar in case of individuals notified by the tax authorities as major or special taxpayers. This period cannot be extended. Late filing of the return will attract fines and interests.
Spouses must, in principle, file joint returns even if they have personal income arising from their own activities. They will be considered as a single taxpayer. Husbands and wives can file separate tax returns only when the following conditions apply:
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries, professional fees, royalties paid to non-residents, and certain other payments received by non-residents.
Individuals other than employees must file estimated returns only if, during the year immediately preceding fiscal year, they received income exceeding TU 1,500 from: (i) commercial or credit activities, (ii) independent professional activities, (iii) leasing or subleasing activities involving movable or real property, and (iv) participation in net profits of partnerships or communities not subject to tax payment as provided for in domestic regulations.
The estimated tax is based on 75% of the tax that would result from applying full rates to the estimated income declared (80%). The prepaid tax resulting from the estimated returns must be paid in either a single instalment or in six equal instalments.
BI-weekly income tax advanced payments apply to individuals qualified as special taxpayers not earning wages and salaries instead of the estimated tax return.
## Tax audit process
According to the Master Tax Code, the tax administration is entitled to review the existence of a taxpayer’s liability, whether it has been reported or not. In exercising this power, the tax administration is entitled to obtain and verify information in connection with a determined tax liability. Verifications may be carried out on the basis of available information or on a presumptive basis if concrete information is not available
## Statute of limitations
The actions to verify, inspect, determine the tax obligation, and impose the legal fines are limited to a six-year period since the action was committed. However, the statute of limitation can be extended to ten years if there was no filing or payment of the tax obligation, the taxpayer did not register before the tax authority, the goods subject to the tax obligation were taken or are out of the country, the taxpayer has duplicated or no accounting, or the fine to be imposed is a freedom-limited restriction.
The right to acquire the return of taxes has a statute of limitation of six years.
In general terms, tax audits are mainly focused on corporate taxpayers. However, those individuals qualified by the tax authorities as special taxpayers have been subject to tax audits.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Federal VAT (*Impuesto al Valor Agregado* or IVA) is a one-time tax payable by the ultimate consumer of all types of products and services. However, each business entity involved in the process, from the sale of raw materials to the production and distribution of finished products to the ultimate consumer, is required to include the tax on its products to customers (output tax) and to pay the tax on its purchases or imports of goods and services (input tax), crediting the amounts paid against the amounts due on its own activities. The net amount payable by each entity is considered to represent a tax on the value added.
In general, VAT does not represent an additional cost to business enterprises because even though all types of business enterprises, including government departments and agencies (with some exceptions), are required to accept charges of the tax by suppliers on their purchases of goods and services, such amounts are normally deductible from the liability of the business enterprises for the tax on their bills to customers.
There are exceptions, principally when the sales of an enterprise are exempt from VAT, in which case the enterprise is treated as the final consumer and must absorb any VAT charges on its purchases except insofar as its activities are subject to the zero rate (*see below*). However, input tax paid on goods or services used to produce items that are exempt from VAT may be deducted for CIT purposes.
### Taxable transactions
In general, VAT is payable on all sales, rental, and importation of goods, and rendering of services executed or used in the country, although a number of significant exceptions are provided by law.
### Sales of goods
The law defines a sale as any transmission of tangible goods, including those made on a conditional basis or through an irrevocable trust. The taxable amount of a sale includes the sale price as well as other amounts charged to the purchaser for other taxes, duties, interest, or surcharges of whatever nature. VAT becomes payable when the goods are invoiced or shipped to the customers or when the price is paid in full or in part.
Exempt sales include the following:
### Services
Taxable services are those rendered within Venezuela by one person to another on an independent basis, transportation of passengers or goods, agency activities, technical assistance, and transfer of technology. VAT is payable to service providers at the time the invoice is issued, the service is rendered, or the fee becomes demandable, whichever comes first. The taxable amount includes not only the price of services, but also charges to the customers for other taxes, interest, etc.
Exempt services include the following:
### Exports
Exports are zero-rated. Consequently, VAT is not payable on exports, including exports of in-bond processing companies, technical fees to foreign residents, and sales to in-bond processing companies and companies that export their entire production. Sale of natural hydrocarbon by joint ventures regulated by the Hydrocarbon Law to the National Oil Company (PDVSA) and affiliated companies are also taxable at 0%. Though exporters do not collect VAT on export sales, they may recover VAT charges on their purchases of goods and services by means of a refund certificate. This certificate may be used to pay other tax obligations. If such exporters carry out sales in the country, they will be entitled to recover only input VAT related to foreign sales.
Additionally, a zero rate applies to independent personal services provided by residents in Venezuela that are used solely by and for the benefit of persons abroad without a PE or fixed base in Venezuela.
### Tax rates
The rate may change every year, within the range of 8% to 16.5%. The current general VAT rate is 16%.
A 15% VAT applies to the sale and imports of luxury products (e.g. vehicles valued at 40,000 United States dollars [USD] or more, motorcycles valued at USD 20,000 or more, nickel or token game machines, aircraft used for recreational or sport purposes, jewellery valued at USD 300 or more).
An additional tax rate, subject to modification by the National Executive and ranging from 5% to 25%, is applicable to goods and supply of services paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
The newly introduced additional tax rate will be effective as of 30 continuous days following the publication of the Official Gazette by which the National Executive is to establish the applicable rate.
An 8% VAT applies to the following transactions:
### Payment and collection
According to the general rule, excess VAT charged or chargeable to customers over VAT paid to vendors or customs authorities (*Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administración*, *Aduanera y Tributaria* or SENIAT), including the correspondent payment, must be remitted to SENIAT within the first 15 days of the following month.
As of 1 September 2018, the VAT monthly taxable period has been temporarily modified to a weekly basis for purposes of filing the final return and calculating the tax due for special taxpayers engaged in activities other than the exploitation of mines, hydrocarbons, and connected activities and do not derive royalty income from such exploitations. The advance VAT payment is based on the tax declared the prior week divided by the working days of the week. As of September 2020, the calendar was modified from a weekly to a bi-weekly basis.
## Customs duties
As a general rule, the importation of goods into Venezuela is subject to customs duties. These duties are generally levied on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the product being imported, excluding VAT.
Customs duty rates generally range from 5% to 35%. The duty rates vary depending on the product involved. In general, import tariffs are 5% for capital goods, 10% to 15% for raw materials and intermediate goods, and 15% to 35% for finished products. In addition, all imports are subject to customs handling charge, a duty import, and VAT.
With regard to procedural aspects, the Master Customs Law establishes two modes of customs declaration: (i) the anticipated informative declaration, only applicable to imports, and (ii) the definitive declaration for customs regime, also known as the single customs declaration. In this regard, it establishes that entities with competence for the issuance of permits and licences are to issue the corresponding documents, at least 25 business days in advance to the arrival of the merchandise, in order for importers to register the advanced informative customs declaration.
As part of the import process, the custom authorities may designate an Authorised Economic Operator, which will be the company domiciled in the country, involved in the international logistic chain, to serve as the substitute of simplified control procedures and customs clearance.
As result of the 2020 amendment in the Master Customs Law, reference for the determination of minimum and maximum amounts for custom services fees, previously provided in terms of tax units, is replaced by the official exchange rate of the currency of highest value as published by the Venezuelan Central Bank. In the same way, fines previously provided in tax units have been amended and are now provided on the basis of the official exchange rate of the currency of highest value as published by the Venezuelan Central Bank. For these purposes, the exchange rate in force at the date of payment will apply.
## Excise taxes
### Tax on alcohol and alcoholic beverages
In general terms, the manufacture, commercialisation, and importation of alcohol and alcoholic beverages are subject to excise taxes. The Law of Tax on Alcohol and Alcoholic Beverages provides for three main types of excise taxes:
The Alcohol and Alcoholic Species Tax Law specifies the time of payment of the tax as follows: (i) for importers, at the moment the merchandise is nationalised and (ii) for producers, upon withdrawal of the products from the establishment.
### Tax on cigarettes and manufacturing of tobacco
The importation and national production of cigarettes and tobacco, fine cuts, and other tobacco derivatives to be consumed in Venezuela is subject to an excise tax. This proportional tax is levied at a rate of 70% on the retail price of cigarettes, tobacco, and its derivatives. As per the Cigarette and Tobacco Manufacturing Tax Law, produced and imported taxable products for zones under the Territorial Customs Regime, duty free shops, and special development regions shall also be subject to tax.
The time of payment of tax on cigarettes and manufacturing of tobacco is as follows: (i) for national production, before the products are removed from the manufacturing establishments and (ii) for imports, at the time of customs declaration.
## Urban Property Tax
The Urban Property Tax is a local or municipal tax payable by any person who owns property rights or any other real rights on urban real estates. The taxable basis is the value of the urban real estate. For these purposes, the fair market value of the real estate is provided as a point of reference. The applicable rate varies according to each municipality.
## Public registry tax
Commercial companies are registered with the Mercantile Registry Office and are subject to a tax levied upon incorporation of a company and registration of capital increases. The tax is 1% of the amounts of subscribed or increased capital.
The sale of a going concern is also registered in the Mercantile Registry Office and is subject to a tax levied upon the total amount of the sell. The tax is 2% of the amount.
## Stamp duties
The Stamp Duties Law establishes a number of stamp duties on the issuance of official documents (e.g. certificates, permits, authorisations, registrations). Stamp duties may be levied at fixed amounts or at a rate based on the value of the transaction or work in question and vary depending on the jurisdiction.
According to the Law of Registries and Notaries enacted on 16 December 2021, the tax unit was replaced by the Petro (the Venezuela state cryptocurrency) as reference value to set forth the maximum amounts of payments for some services, such as: (i) authorisation, (ii) fees for the provision of services by the Autonomous Service of Registries and Notaries (SAREN) and the offices of Principal Registries and Public Registries, and (iii) processing rights.
## District Capital stamp tax
The District Capital stamp tax on subscribed or increased capital of companies is 2%.
## Tax on Large Financial Transactions
Taxpayers for the purposes of the Tax on Large Financial Transactions comprise:
Special taxpayers are comprised of individuals and entities with specific characteristics with regard to income level or type of activity and have been designated as such by the tax authorities by notification.
As of 19 November 2018, the applicable rate is 2% on the total bank debit or taxable transaction. As of 15 July 2024, the tax rate for the above indicated cases was changed to 0%.
The 2022 partial amendment of the Law included new categories of taxpayers subject to tax at a different tax rate as follows:
The tax applies, among others, to the following transactions:
Certain transactions involving state-issued securities, payments of taxes, and transfer of funds among same-holder accounts are exempted from this tax.
The tax is not deductible for Venezuelan income tax purposes.
The Administrative Ruling SNAT/2022/000013, published in the Official Gazette N° 42,339 dated 17 March 2022, provides for the designation of special taxpayers as collection agents of the tax for payments received in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela without mediation of the financial system.
## High net wealth tax
The high net wealth tax applies to the net worth of taxpayers qualified as special taxpayers and shall be determined on an annual basis on the value of the net worth at the end of the tax year.
Individual and corporate special taxpayers are subject to tax when their worth is equal to or higher than TU 150 million. Resident individuals and entities in the terms of the Constitutional Law are subject to tax on their total net-worth, regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced, whereas non-resident taxpayers or nationals non-resident in the country are subject to tax on assets located and rights enforceable in the country. Foreign persons with a PE in the country are subject to tax on the total net worth attributable to the PE, regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced.
Legal persons are resident when any of the following circumstances take place:
The annual tax period end has been provided to end on 30 September of each year. The first taxable period was that ending 30 September 2019. The applicable rate is 0.25%. The taxable basis is comprised by the sum of the total assets’ value less liabilities and excluding the value of burdens and encumbrances, as well as tax-exempt assets and rights.
The return filing and payment of the tax shall be executed from 1 October and 30 November of each year. The tax shall be reported pursuant to the standards provided for such purposes on the tax authorities’ website.
## Gift tax
Overall, the Inheritance and Donations Tax Law, published on 1999, stipulates the taxes attributable to inheritances left by individuals. Nonetheless, this Law provides regulation about donations, which are significant to corporations. Subject to payment of the gift tax are the beneficiaries of gifts in the form of movable or real property, rights, or shares located in the country.
For tax calculation purposes, the progressive tax rate (up to 55%) set forth in the Law will be applied to the donated good. Both donors and donees are jointly liable for the tax generated from the gift.
The gift tax is applicable from the time in which the donors manifest before the National Treasury their will to donate and must be paid before the registration of any document formalising or evidencing the authenticity of the gift. Should the donation not be perfected due to express will of the donor or rejection on the part of the donee, the obligation to pay the tax will be eliminated and reimbursement may be requested of the amounts paid in this connection.
Under the transfer pricing rules contained in the VITL, the tax authorities are empowered to impute income in inter-company transactions at a price reflecting the fair market value of the property being transferred.
Before the introduction of transfer pricing rules, under the Inheritance and Donations Tax Law, the tax authorities could and still can presume in transactions involving a sale, assignment, barter, or transfer, the existence of a donation if, for instance, the price stipulated in such transaction does not reflect the real value of the property being transacted. In such a case, a gift tax may be imposed on the difference between the fair market value of the property being transacted and the consideration received in return.
Also, a cancellation of a debt gives rise to gift tax issues. In this regard, the Inheritance and Donations Tax Law provides that the total or partial forgiveness or cancellation of a loan must be viewed as a gift and, as such, is subject to gift tax.
## Windfall tax on oil production
The windfall tax on oil companies is provided in the following terms:
The tax is payable by oil companies exporting with sale purposes. Also, the mixed companies (*empresas mixtas*) created in accordance with the Master Hydrocarbons Law that sell oil and by-products to PDVSA, or any of its affiliates, are also obligated to pay the above-described tax.
On the other hand, tax exemption is provided for the following cases:
The tax is payable on a monthly basis in foreign currency. Other terms of payments are to be regulated by Resolution.
Additionally, USD 80 per barrel is the maximum price to be used as the calculation basis for the payment of royalties, extraction tax, and export registration tax provided for in the Master Hydrocarbons Law.
## Hydrocarbons Organic Law
The state is entitled to 30% of the volume of hydrocarbons extracted from any deposit, by way of royalties. The National Executive can reduce this within certain limits, when it is shown that certain types of deposits are not economically exploitable. On 19 December 2019, changes to the calculation basis of the royalties were announced.
Persons conducting activities related to hydrocarbons must pay the following taxes:
### Surface tax
For the portion of the surface area granted that is not under development, the equivalent of TU 100 for each square kilometre or portion of a square kilometre for every elapsed year is due as a surface tax. This tax will increase annually by 2% during the first five years and 5% during the following years.
### Tax on own consumption
10% of the value of each cubic metre of hydrocarbon by-products produced and consumed as fuel in wholly-owned operations, based on the price of the end consumer, is due as a tax. In the case that said product fails to be sold in a domestic market, the Ministry of Energy and Mines shall provide the price.
## Gaseous Hydrocarbons Organic Law
The Gaseous Hydrocarbons Organic Law establishes a system of royalties, determinable by the volumes of gaseous hydrocarbons extracted from any deposit and not re-injected. The state is also entitled to a 20% share for this item.
The Law also provides that additional legislation may obligate these entities to pay taxes on hydrocarbons consumed, such as fuel. However, no additional regulations have been enacted for enforcement of this obligation.
Additional taxes are provided for in the licence agreements, which vary for each particular case.
## Taxes and contributions on telecommunication activities
### Taxes on telecommunication activities
Telecommunication services providers are subject to tax on the provision of sound and television broadcasting as well as other telecommunication services. The tax is levied on gross income from the telecommunication activity. The applicable rate in case of sound and television broadcasting is 1% where as other telecommunication services are subject to tax at 2.3%.
The exploitation of orbital resources and associated portions of the radio spectrum, as well as the supply of satellite capacity to authorised operators for the provision of telecommunication services, are subject to a 0.5% tax on the amount billed or collected for supply of satellite capacity.
### Contribution to the National Telecommunications Commission
Telecommunication services providers are subject to a 0.5% special contribution on gross income generated from telecommunication activities. The contribution must be paid to the National Telecommunications Commission.
Users of the radio electrical spectrum are subject to an annual contribution for administration and control that may not exceed 0.5% of the user’s gross revenues. In case of users engaged in rendering sound and television broadcasting services, the contribution shall not exceed 0.2% of the gross revenues.
### Contribution to the Universal Service Fund
Telecommunication services providers, except sound and television broadcasters, are subject to the payment of a 1% contribution on gross revenues to the Universal Services Fund.
Telecommunication services providers, except sound and television broadcasters, are subject to the payment of a 0.50% contribution on gross revenues to FIDETEL.
### Contribution according to Law of Social Responsibility in radio, television and electronic means
## Science, technology, and innovation contribution
According to Amendment enacted in April 2022, the Law on Science, Technology, and Innovation (LOCTI) establishes a mandatory contribution to be paid by companies that obtained, in the previous taxable month, over 150,000 times the foreign currency of highest value as published by the Venezuela Central Bank.
Contributions established in the LOCTI are as follows:
The National Fund for Science, Technology, and Innovation (FONACIT) is the entity responsible for the administration, collection, control, verification, and qualitative and quantitative determination of the contributions.
The contribution will be payable on a monthly basis.
The purpose of the Organic Law on Sports, Physical Activity, and Physical Education (Sports Law) is to establish the public service nature of physical education and the promotion, organisation, and administration of sports and physical activity, as well as their organisation as an economic activity with social aims.
The provision of the Sports Law are of a public nature and are applicable to the public national, state, and municipal administration and organisations, and also to individuals and legal entities that conduct any activity related to the practice, promotion, organisation, sponsorship, administration, or any economic activity associated with sports or physical activities and education.
The Sports Law creates the National Fund for the Development of Sports, Physical Activity, and Physical Education, which will be constituted with the contributions made by companies or other public or private organisations that perform economic activities for profit in the country; by donations, gifts, or any other special contribution made by the Republic, the states, the municipalities, or any other public or private entity; and by the revenue produced by such funds.
The contribution is 1% of the annual net of accounting profit and is payable by all companies or other public or private organisations that perform economic activities within the country and obtain an annual net or accounting profit of more than TU 20,000. Up to 50% of the contribution can be for the implementation of the taxpayer's own projects, provided the respective project follows the guidelines to be issued by the National Sports Institute, which will be updated every two years.
## Anti-drugs contribution
The Organic Drug Law stipulates that any company employing 50 or more employees must make an annual contribution from their operating profit equivalent to 1%. On the other hand, corporations with the specifications mentioned before but that are dedicated to the manufacture or import of alcohol beverages, tobacco, or their mixtures are required to make a contribution equivalent of 2% from their operating profit. Under the definitions established by this Law, operating profit can be understood as the result from subtracting the operating expenses from the income profit in accordance with the accepted Venezuelan general accounting principles.
This contribution will be collected by the National Anti-Drug Fund (FONA) within 60 continuous days counted from the end of the fiscal year.
Note that this contribution can be retrieved if the company performs:
## Payroll taxes and other contributions
Contributions applicable to resident companies in Venezuela:
| Contributions | Basis | Contribution basis (cap) | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mandatory social security regime contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to five minimum salaries for urban workers | 9/10/11 | 4 | (1, 2, 5) |
| Employment benefit regime contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to ten minimum salaries for urban workers | 2 | 0.5 | (1) |
| Housing regime contribution | Total monthly (or integral) salary | No cap (5, 6) | 2 | 1 | (5, 6) |
| Employee training contribution (INCES) | Total salaries paid by the employer for purposes of the employer's contribution. | No cap | 2 | 0.5 (4) | (3, 4) |
| Workplace prevention, conditions, and environment contribution (LOPCYMAT) | Total salaries paid to employees | No cap is established | From 0.75 to 10 | N/A | (7, 8) |
Notes
1. Minimum salary was increased to VES 130 as of 15 March 2022.
2. The employer's contribution to social security depends on the company's risk qualification (minimum risk, middle risk, or maximum risk).
3. Regarding *Instituto Nacional de Capacitación y Educación Socialista* (INCES) contribution, the employer must contribute 2% of the total wages and salaries paid to employees.
4. Employers are also required to withhold 0.5% of the annual profit-sharing bonus paid to employees.
5. According to the *Ley Orgánica del Sistema de Seguridad Social* (LOSSS), the general rule for contribution basis for the new systems may not exceed ten minimum salaries. The transition rules establish a contribution basis of five metropolitan minimum salaries for urban workers for social security purposes. No cap is expressly established in the transition rules for the housing system and work, security, and health regime.
6. The basis of calculation of the housing contributions is the ‘Integral Salary’. The Integral Salary is a concept established in the Organic Labour Law, and it comprises the following payments: commissions, gratifications, profit sharing bonuses, vacation bonus as well as surcharges for holidays, overtime, night shifts, among others, all of which are made to the employee and correspond to the services rendered by the individual.
7. Contributions to be made to this regime are exclusively for the employer and vary depending on the risk associated to the company. A company's risk is to be determined by the *Instituto Nacional de Prevención,* *Salud y Seguridad Laborales* (INPSASEL).
8. *Ley Orgánica de Prevención, Condiciones y Medio Ambiente de Trabajo* (LOPCYMAT) regulations do not establish a cap for the contribution. However, as mentioned, the LOSSS establishes a maximum of the minimum urban salaries. For this reason, there are several contrary interpretations on whether a cap should be applied in this case.
| Other contributions (*see above*) | Basis | Contribution basis (cap) | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Science, technology, and innovation contribution (LOCTI) (1) | Total annual income | N/A | 0.50/1/2 | N/A |
| Anti-drug contribution (LOD) (2) | Operating profit | N/A | 1/2 (3) | N/A |
Notes
1. *Ley Orgánica de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación* (LOCTI).
2. *Ley Orgánica de Drogas* (LOD).
3. 2% in the case of companies that manufacture or import alcohol beverages or tobacco. 1% for companies that employ 50 or more employees.
## Municipal business licence tax
Companies and business entities, as well as individuals and unincorporated companies, are subject to municipal tax on gross income from industrial or trade activities carried on in the municipality during the fiscal year. The applicable rates vary depending on the activity and the municipality.
Under the Master Law for the Coordination and Harmonisation of the Taxing Powers of States and Municipalities, some procedures and parameters have been simplified or unified, including, among others, the following matters:
## Other municipal taxes
Municipalities also tax vehicles, public entertainment, legal bets, and commercial advertisements. There are also various municipal tariffs and fees.

## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Federal VAT (*Impuesto al Valor Agregado* or IVA), is a one-time tax payable by the ultimate consumer of all types of products and services.
In general, VAT is payable on all sales, rental, and importation of goods, and rendering of services executed or used in the country, although a number of significant exceptions are provided by law.
The rate may change every year, within the range of 8% to 16.5%. The current general rate is 16%.
A 15% VAT applies to the sale and imports of luxury products (e.g. vehicles valued at 40,000 United States dollars [USD] or more, motorcycles valued at USD 20,000 or more, nickel or token game machines, aircraft used for recreational or sport purposes, jewellery valued at USD 300 or more).
An additional tax rate, subject to modification by the National Executive and ranging from 5% to 25%, is applicable to goods and supply of services paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. To date, the applicable rate has not been published.
The newly introduced additional tax rate will be effective as of 30 continuous days following the publication of the Official Gazette by which the National Executive is to establish the applicable rate.
An 8% VAT applies to the following transactions:
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Individual and corporate special taxpayers are subject to tax when their worth is equal to or higher than TU 150 million. Resident individuals and entities in the terms of the Constitutional Law are subject to tax on their total net worth, regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced, whereas non-resident taxpayers or nationals non-resident in the country are subject to tax on assets located and rights enforceable in the country. Foreign persons with a permanent establishment (PE) in the country are subject to tax on the total net worth attributable to the PE regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced.
Under the Constitutional Law that enacted the high net wealth tax for special taxpayers, the circumstances determining individual tax residence have been enhanced with respect to those provided in the Venezuelan Income Tax Law and the Master Tax Code
The annual tax period end has been provided to end on 30 September of each year. The first taxable period was that ending 30 September 2019. The applicable rate is 0.25%. The taxable basis is comprised by the sum of the total assets’ value less liabilities and excluding the value of burdens and encumbrances, as well as tax-exempt assets and rights.
The return filing and payment of the tax shall be executed from 1 October and 30 November of each year. The tax shall be reported pursuant to the standards provided for such purposes in the tax authorities’ website.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
The estate and gift tax (*Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones* [EGT]) is imposed on all persons that are beneficiaries of an estate, inheritance, or gift of immovable property, rights, or shares located within Venezuela. The EGT is territorial in the sense that it is levied on Venezuelan estates and gifts, irrespective of the residence, domicile, or nationality of the beneficiary. EGT is imposed on the value of all property inherited or received from the descendant or donor (less certain liabilities and expenses), which must be appraised based on current market values at the time of the death of the descendant or at the time of the gift. The tax rate varies depending on the degree of kinship between the descendant of the donor and the beneficiary.
## Property taxes
The Urban Property Tax is a local or municipal tax payable by any person who owns property rights or any other real rights on urban real estates. The taxable basis is the value of the urban real estate. For these purposes, the fair market value of the real estate is provided as a point of reference. The applicable rate varies according to each municipality.
## Tax on Large Financial Transactions
The partial amendment of the Law included new categories of taxpayers subject to tax a different tax rate as follows:
The Administrative Ruling SNAT/2022/000013, published in the Official Gazette N° 42,339 dated 17 March 2022, provides for the designation of special taxpayers as collection agents of the tax for payments received in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela without mediation of the financial system.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Taxable period
Taxable years may not exceed 12 months, but the first year may be less than 12 months. Taxpayers engaged in commercial, industrial, or service activities may choose a taxable year that does not coincide with the calendar year. A taxpayer that makes such an election may only change it after obtaining prior authorisation from the tax authorities. All other taxpayers are require to conform their taxable year to the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Final tax returns must be filed within three months following the end of the tax year or at the date indicated on the corresponding calendar for those designated as a ‘special taxpayer’ by the tax authorities. The system is one of self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
The total amount of tax due must be paid at the time of filing the annual return. Estimated tax payments must be paid consecutively in six monthly instalments. Companies engaged in mining, hydrocarbon exploitation, and related activities must make 12 equal monthly estimated tax payments.
As of September 2018, weekly income tax advance payments have been set forth for 'special taxpayers'. The applicable rates have been established as follows: (i) 2% for financial institutions, banking, insurance, and reinsurance sectors, and (ii) 1% for other 'special taxpayers'. The aforesaid will temporarily replace the filing and payment obligations in connection with the estimated income tax return. As of September 2020, the advance must be remitted on a bi-weekly basis.
### Penalties
Fines for omitted taxes when assessed as a result of tax audits range from 100% to 300% of the omitted tax. The tax authorities generally assess the average fine (200%) unless aggravating or mitigating circumstances apply.
Fines are reduced to 30% if assessment is accepted within a specific timeframe.
Fines are adjusted according to the official exchange rate of the currency of highest value as published by the Venezuelan Central Bank at the time of the infringement and will be assessed on the value in place at the moment of payment.
Late payment interest is 1.2 times the average banking lending rate considering the six major banks.
## Tax audit process
According to the Master Tax Code, the tax administration is entitled to review the existence of a taxpayer’s liability, whether it has been reported or not. In exercising this power, the tax administration is entitled to obtain and verify information in connection with a determined tax liability. Verifications may be carried out on the basis of available information or on a presumptive basis if concrete information is not available.
## Statute of limitations
According to the Master Tax Code, the statute of limitations for tax liabilities is six years starting to run on 1 January of the year following the tax period involved. Regarding taxes that are assessed by periods (e.g. income tax and VAT), it is understood that the taxable event occurs at the end of such period. Exceptionally, the statute of limitations is extended to ten years in any of the following circumstances: (i) the taxpayer fails to declare the taxable event or submit the relevant returns; (ii) the taxpayer does not comply with its obligation to register with the tax administration; (iii) the tax administration was not able to become aware of the taxable event; (iv) the taxpayer has extracted from the country property that is subject to the payment of the tax liability or if the tax liability is related to taxable events occurring abroad; or (v) the taxpayer does not keep its accounting in accordance with the relevant standards.
Tax audits are generally focused on ‘special taxpayers’. The main subjects of focus of tax audits on corporate taxpayers are related to compliance of formal obligations for direct and indirect taxes and transfer pricing.

# Venezuela
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
## Goodwill
Deduction of the amortisation of goodwill is allowed for income tax purposes. Deduction of the cost basis for purposes of calculating the capital gain on the sale is also allowed for income tax purposes.
## Organisational and pre-operating expenses
Domestic income tax regulations do not provide for specific guidance as to the treatment of organisational and pre-operating expenses. The accepted practice is to follow GAAP.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on a loan, the principal of which is invested to generate income, is deductible.
## Bad debt
Losses arising from bad debts are deductible, provided:
## Charitable contributions
Deductions for allowable charitable contributions are limited to 10% of taxable income (before deducting contributions) when taxable income does not exceed TU 10,000. When taxable income exceeds TU 10,000, charitable contributions are limited to 8% of taxable income. For oil extraction companies, the deduction is limited to 1% of the pre-contribution tax amount.
## Fines and penalties
Income tax regulations do not expressly provide for the treatment of fines and penalties; however, such expenses are not deductible as they do not meet the normality and necessity requirements.
## Taxes
Municipal, state, and local taxes are deductible in determining taxable income. Corporate taxes are not deductible.
## Other significant items
Payments required by the labour law, such as profit sharing (generally between 15 days and four months' salary) and severance indemnity accruals, are also deductible. In cases of unjustified dismissals, double severance indemnities must be paid. However, accruals for such additional indemnities are generally not deductible until paid.
Corporate tax deduction of employees' compensation and professional fees is subject to compliance with the taxpayer's obligations as employer as provided for in the Law, which entail, among others, withholding obligations.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for three years. During the three-year term, the amount of losses available to carry forward cannot exceed 25% of the tax period’s taxable income. Carryforward losses derived from the inflation adjustment have been eliminated. Losses may not be carried back. Foreign losses may be offset only against foreign profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Venezuelan corporation may claim a deduction for royalties and technical assistance and for technical service fees paid to foreign affiliates, subject to the following conditions:

# Venezuela
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Group taxation is not possible in Venezuela.
## Transfer pricing
Taxpayers that carry out operations with related parties abroad must calculate their income, costs, and deductions by applying a defined methodology of transfer pricing. This regime is applicable to imports, exports, and interest paid to recipients abroad as well as technical assistance, technological services, and royalty fees.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules limit the deduction of interest from debt with related parties in excess of a 1:1 debt-to-equity ratio. Under these rules, if the average of a taxpayer’s debt (with related and unrelated parties) exceeds the average amount of its equity for the respective fiscal year, the excess debt is treated as equity for income tax purposes. Consequently, the ability to deduct interest on related-party loans may be affected.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
A Venezuelan taxpayer has to recognise, annually on an accrual basis, income generated in a company or other legal entity it controls that is located in a jurisdiction with low fiscal taxation (JLFT). Further, investments in a JLFT must be declared to the SENIAT.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign income tax paid on taxable foreign income may be offset by the payable Venezuelan tax, up to the proportion of Venezuelan payable tax related to foreign-source income. Taxpayers must keep documentation of foreign tax. No carryforward rules are provided for in domestic regulations.
## Other incentives
Customs duty incentives are also available, such as drawbacks on the import of materials used for exporting products. This may take the form of a tax refund certificate issued by the Ministry of Finance. The certificate is a negotiable bond and will be accepted by the Treasury Funds Office for payment of national taxes. Determination of the amount of the refund will take into account the import duties effectively paid at the time the materials used in the manufacture of the exported product were received in Venezuela. Note that this incentive is not currently being applied in practice.

## Exchange control
In January 2003, the Venezuelan government and the Venezuelan Central Bank (VCB) restricted the free trade of foreign currency and established an Exchange Control Regime.
The Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly enacted new Exchange Agreement N° 1 on 7 September 2018. The Exchange Agreement provides for new mechanisms for the settlement of transaction of acquisition and sale of foreign currency for the public and private sectors and abrogates the Exchange Agreements issued under the previous regime.
The VCB and the Popular Power Finance Ministry are authorised to determine the actions for development of the foreign exchange policy in accordance with Exchange Agreement N° 1:
The following three mechanisms of operations are provided for the private sector:
In addition, special considerations are provided for export activities and tourism.
To date, regulations for implementation of the above-mentioned mechanisms, which are to be issued mainly by the VCB, have not been published. A new means of currency exchange was created by Resolution N°19-05-01 published in the official Gazette N°41.624 on 2 May 2019 whereby national banks sell to natural and legal persons through exchange tables.

## Partial Amendment of the Law on Large Financial Transactions Tax
The partial amendment of the Decree with Rank, Value, and Force of Law on the Major Financial Transactions Tax was published in the Extraordinary Official Gazette No. 6,687 dated 25 February 2022. The amendment basically expands the categories of persons subject to tax and provides for a new rate of 3% on certain transactions carried out in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The amendment entered into force on 27 March 2022.
In addition, Decree N° 4,467 providing for a tax exoneration on charges in connection with transactions involving securities issued or guaranteed by the Republic of Venezuela or the Venezuelan Central Bank and securities traded through Stock Exchange Houses was published in the Extraordinary Official Gazette N° 6,689 dated 25 February 2022. The Decree also provides for other transactions not subject to tax and is in force for one year as of the date of publication.
On the basis of the above-indicated regulatory changes, Administrative Ruling SNAT/2022/000013, published in the Official Gazette N° 42,339 dated 17 March 2022, provides for the designation of special taxpayer as collection agents of the tax for payments received in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela without mediation of the financial system. The Ruling entered into force on 28 March 2022.

## Visas and permits
Visas must be obtained prior to entering Venezuela. In order to gain access to Venezuela, international assignees must have a valid visa issued by the Venezuelan Consulate. Obtaining a visa can take several months, so applications should be submitted well in advance. Please also note that visa applicants must have a valid passport that should not expire for at least six months from the application date.
The Venezuelan government issues various types of visas (in total 13 various types of visas); the most important are Transient Business Visa (TR-N), Transient Work Permit Visas (TR-L), Transient Family Visas (TR-F), and Resident Visas.
Do note that all of the documents to be submitted in Venezuela shall be filed in Spanish or translated by a certified translator, notarised and apostilled/legalised whenever it may apply.
### Transient Business Visa (TR-N)
Business leaders, executives, representatives of companies or industries, and micro-entrepreneurs who are not willing to migrate but need to enter the country to carry out legal and lucrative matters related to their businesses, such as commercial, mercantile, and/or financial activities, must apply for a business visa (TR-N). This kind of visa is valid for one year, with multiple arrivals and departures, and will allow permanence of 180 days continuous or not, non-extendable. This visa does not allow the holder to work in Venezuela as a dependant.
### Transient Work Permit Visas (TR-L)
Companies wishing to hire a non-resident foreigner for work in a dependent relationship within the country must apply for a work visa (TR-L). This kind of visa may be granted for one year if a work permit is granted and can be locally extended for the same period. It may be also granted for three months without the need of a work permit, non-extendable. Both allows the applicant for multiple arrivals and departures and permanence for the same period. Further details are to be considered as drafted below.
To obtain the one-year TR-L visa, the hiring company shall start the visa request process, which comprehends:
1. Filing for a work permit, locally, before the Ministry of Labour, where several documents will be requested to prove the local company qualification, tax solvencies, foreigners quota (maximum 10% of total foreigners in local payroll), and foreigners payments total amount (no more than 20% paid to Venezuelans), applicant high qualification for the job being applied for, and any other situation they may deem necessary to check. These scenarios are usually proved by submitting:
2. Filing for the work visa issuance authorisation, locally, before the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice. The request should be filled with:
To obtain the three-months TR-L visa, the hiring company shall start the visa request directly before the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice with the very same requirements as stated in (2) above, except for the work permit, which is not necessary, and a specific employment offer, which shall state the three months threshold work timeframe.
Once the visa issuance authorisation is granted, the company should hand it over along with the work permit to the applicant for him/her to be able to formally request the visa before the Venezuelan consulate. Do notice that the consulate officials are authorised by law to request any other document they may deem necessary to grant the visa. If approved, the visa will be stamped in the applicant passport. If denied, a reasoned letter shall be sent by the consulate officials to the Venezuelan authorities.
Upon arrival, the one-year TR-L holder must request one's foreigner ID (not available for the three months visa holder). The law also requests foreigners to register before the 'Foreigners Registry' system of the Ministry of Interior and Justice, but, as of January 2023, said registry has not been enforced.
If the company aims the applicant to remain within the country for more than one year, the work permit should be renewed by formal request before the Ministry of Labour, as well as the visa before SAIME.
### Transient Family Visas (TR-F)
The foreign employee with a TR-L visa can apply for a transient family visa (TR-F) for one’s spouse, non-emancipated children under 18 years of age, parents, and in-laws upon certified proof of the family tie and economic dependency. One then must present the following documents:
The TR-F visa is valid for one year, with multiple entries, and will allow permanence in the country for the same period. It can be extended in the country by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice, for the same period, upon ratification of the work permit by the Ministry of Labour.
### Resident visas
The foreigner who has remained in Venezuela for at least one uninterrupted year with a TR-L or TR-F visa may apply for residency with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Justice. Resident visas are valid for five years and can be renewed every five years.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Employment income
Resident and non-resident individuals are taxed on salaries and wages and on any other remuneration for personal services, such as meal allowances, pensions, profit sharing, and other similar remunerations, regardless of the place of payment or currency used.
Employees are not taxed on pensions and termination benefits as set forth in the labour law or collective contracts (employer/union) and interest thereon, or income from trusts established to administer employer contributions to the related funds.
Foreign-source income will be taxable for tax-resident individuals unless an exemption or tax treaty applies.
## Equity compensation
There are no specifications regarding the tax treatment of equity-based compensation.  In this regard, general rules on taxation of employment income apply.
## Business income
All income earned by individuals from business activities carried out as a sole proprietor is to be reported in the annual tax return and is subject to the same tax rate applicable to individuals obtaining other income.
## Capital gains
Residents are taxed on their capital gains as ordinary income.
Capital gains obtained on the sale of Venezuelan stock, registered with the Venezuelan National Securities and Exchange Commission, through a Venezuelan stock exchange are not taxable as ordinary income; however, a 1% flat withholding tax (WHT) on the sale price is payable. In this case, the losses on the sale of Venezuelan stock are not tax deductible.
Capital losses resulting from the sale of stock by other means, capital reduction, or liquidation of a company are only deductible if they meet one of the following conditions:
A capital gain from the sale of a main residence is tax exempt if reinvested in another residence within one year prior to, or two years after, the sale.
## Dividend income
Dividend tax is levied at a flat rate of 34% on the positive difference between book income and fiscal income generated after 2001. To determine this difference, the last in first out (LIFO) method applies. The 34% (domestic) rate can be mitigated under tax treaties to 10%, 5%, or even 0%. The withholdings are to be made at the moment a dividend is declared or credited (to an account of the recipient).
Dividends obtained from companies incorporated or domiciled abroad or incorporated abroad and domiciled in Venezuela are excluded from the dividend tax system. However, these dividends will be taxed at a 34% flat income tax rate. Foreign tax credits on dividends can be offset with the proportional tax.
## Interest income
Income received in the form of interest is taxable when paid. Interest earned from Venezuelan saving deposits or saving funds is tax exempt.
## Rental income
Residents must report the amount of their worldwide rental income received from real estate. They may deduct administrative expenses incurred in connection with the rented property of up to 10% of the rental income for the fiscal year. Additionally, the following expenses are deductible: maintenance, interest on loans for the purchase or construction of rented property, and property taxes.
## Exempt income
Items exempt from taxable income include the following:

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Individuals are considered to be residents in Venezuela for tax purposes when they spend more than 183 days in Venezuela in aggregate during a fiscal year or if they have spent more than 183 days in Venezuela in the preceding year. Thus, an individual who spends 184 days in Venezuela will be deemed to be a resident for tax purposes.
Venezuelan citizens are presumed domiciled in Venezuela unless they can prove otherwise.
