## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Taxable period
For tax purposes, a company’s year-end is 31 December. A different year-end for corporate/accounting purposes is irrelevant.
## Tax returns
With few exceptions, corporate entities, including those that are foreign-controlled, must file an annual tax return consolidating the monthly results of the previous calendar year. This tax return must normally be filed by the last working day of July following the tax year ending on 31 December.
Please note that there are a number of other declarations/returns imposed by the RFB, for different taxes, at federal, municipal, and state levels, which make the tax administration in Brazil notably bureaucratic.
## Payment of tax
In the case of income tax, it is generally calculated monthly, and payments should generally be collected and paid by the last working day of the subsequent month. Any amounts of income tax due for the year (exceeding the payments performed) must be paid by the last working day of March of the subsequent year.
There is an option to pay the tax due at the end of each quarter in three instalments, the first one starting from the subsequent month to the end of the quarter. When income tax is calculated quarterly, the taxpayer must perform the applicable payment by the last working day of the month subsequent to the end of the quarter.
There are many other taxes applied in Brazil with different due dates established by the domestic legislation.
## Tax audit process
As all tax returns are digital (*please refer to public digital bookkeeping system [SPED] below*) , they may be selected for audit by computer, according to various criteria, including type of business, unusually large or small amounts of income or deductions, and random sampling.
No corporate entity, whether a taxpayer or not, is excused from furnishing information or explanations required by the tax authorities.
When audits are conducted on the premises of taxpayers, tax inspectors have broad powers to inspect books and documents and to request information and any data deemed necessary. This is generally disrupting and, in practice, every effort is made to expedite the conclusion of these audits.
Whenever a violation is determined during a tax audit, the inspectors must draw up an infringement notification, which starts the administrative procedure for additional tax assessments.
## Statute of limitations
The tax authorities may generally audit taxpayers up to five years after the close of the tax year. There is some debate about the moment this five-year period begins, depending on the type of tax considered and certain situations. Certain specific taxes and labour obligations have a longer statute of limitation period.
It should be noted that, over the years, Brazil has applied a 'form-over-substance' approach. Nonetheless, as of 10 January 2001, Supplementary Law 104/2001 introduced a substantial modification in the Brazilian Tax Code (the so-called anti-avoidance rule). This law establishes a substance-over-form approach that, once regulated, may allow the RFB to disregard tax-driven transactions.
Although Supplementary Law 104/2001 has not yet been regulated, in our local practice we have seen that tax authorities are keen on ensuring taxpayers have economic substance in their operations (e.g. the use of special purpose entities to enable the amortisation of goodwill for tax purposes in Brazil).
## Public digital bookkeeping system (SPED)
Brazil has implemented a public system of digital bookkeeping known as SPED, which aims at gradually replacing paper copies of invoices and tax records for electronic files. SPED can be defined as an instrument that unifies the activities of reception, validation, storage, and legalisation of records and documents that are part of the commercial and tax bookkeeping of companies, through a single, computerised flow of data.
Comprised of three pillars (electronic invoice, digital fiscal bookkeeping, and digital accounting bookkeeping), the implementation of SPED requires adjustments to the relationship with tax authorities, clients, suppliers and, mainly, on the internal operational processes, which will demand an integrated action from different areas (tax, labour [eSocial], indirect tax [bloco K], accounting, information technology, supplies, production, commercial, and others). On the other hand, occasional inconsistencies from databases, as well as operational errors related to tax and accounting information to be generated, usually unknown to the companies’ administration, are subject to increased visibility and monitoring by the RFB.
It is important to bear in mind that there are many more Brazilian ancillary obligations to fulfil, based on electronic frameworks established by the relevant federal, state, and municipal authorities, which may not be comprised within the SPED environment.
The RFB provide for so-called ‘accounting tax bookkeeping’ (ECF), which replaced the Brazilian corporate income tax return (DIPJ), where Brazilian taxpayers need to inform all transactions that impact the computation bases for IRPJ and CSLL purposes. The ECF shall be transmitted on an annual basis to the SPED system up to the last working day of July of the subsequent year to the calendar year it refers.
In addition, there are also two ancillary obligations for reporting payroll taxes, contributions, and certain withholding taxes, referred to as 'eSocial' and 'EFD-Reinf'. The eSocial specifically relates to payroll taxes and contributions and started in waves in January 2018, and the launching was concluded in June 2018 for companies with gross revenues exceeding BRL 78 million (in 2016). For the other companies, it was planned to start in the second semester of 2019, but the deadlines for certain parts of the overall implementation have been postponed until early 2020. An additional group of information related to health and safety became due in 2020 and 2021.
EFD-Reinf is a spinoff of eSocial, and aside from the disclosure of certain withholding taxes information, it replaces the 'EFD-contribuições' module in relation to the social security contribution levied on gross revenue (CPRB). Companies that should lodge the eSocial should also submit the EFD-Reinf.

## Social security contributions
All employees, self-employed individuals, and employers in Brazil are required to make contributions to the social security system.
Social security contributions due by employees are payable monthly, on Brazilian-source salary income, limited to a ceiling cap each month, according to the rates table, as outlined below.
Based on the Social Security Reform approved in November 2019, as of January 2021, employees will be subject to the payment of monthly social security contributions based on progressive rates from 7.5% up to 14% (resulting in a new cap amount of BRL 828.38), replacing the previous rates, as follows:
| Contribution salary from (BRL) | Up to (BRL) | Social security rate (%) | Ceiling contribution (BRL) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1,212.00 | 7.5 | - |
| 1,212.01 | 2,427.35 | 9 | - |
| 2,427.36 | 3,641.03 | 12 | - |
| 3,641.04 | 7,087.22 | 14 | 828.38 |
Social security contributions due by the employer are calculated considering a flat rate of 20% or 22.5%, depending on the industry's sector. In addition to the referred social security contribution, additional social charges are due by the employer, whose rate will depend on its economic activities.
Social security payable by self-employed individuals may be 5%, 11%, or 20% of the ceiling contribution salary, depending on specific conditions of the individual and of the services rendered.
## Corporate social contributions - Specific sectors
## Capital gains tax
The capital gain tax is applicable on the sale of real estate, vehicles and objects of art and collectibles sold in Brazil or abroad; on stocks sold in foreign markets, as well as on interest income received from investments located offshore. Non-residents are only subject to capital gains tax resulted from the sale of assets located in Brazil. The gain is calculated on the excess of the sale price over the cost of the asset sold at a tax rate of 15%. However, for tax residents in Brazil, there are certain exemptions applicable that must be observed.
It is also important to emphasise that, as of 1 January 2017, the portion of capital gain that exceeds BRL 5 million will be taxed at higher rates, ranging from 17.5% to the maximum rate of 22.5%, the latter applicable to the portion of capital gain that exceeds BRL 30 million.
## Capital gains tax on Brazilian Variable Incomes
Stocks sold in Brazilian markets or in the over the counter (OTC) market are subject to equity income taxation. Gains on the sale of stocks in the Brazilian stock exchange will be treated as equity income and will be taxed at a flat 15% rate, except for day-trade transactions which are taxed at 20%. There are also certain exemptions applicable that must be observed.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Brazil.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Donations, gifts, and inheritances are liable to taxation in Brazil via the Tax on Inheritances and Gifts (*Imposto sobre Transmissão Causa Mortis e Doações* or ITCMD). This is a state tax, which means its regime may vary from state to state in Brazil.
As a general rule, the ITCMD tax rate can reach up to 8%, calculated on the value of the assets or rights, or on the amount being transferred to someone.
## Property taxes
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury and excise taxes in Brazil.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The Brazilian indirect taxes system is complex and has been subject to multiple changes during the past years. The text below contains general information applicable to each of the taxes herein mentioned. It is important to note that the respective legislation includes various exceptions to the general stated rules. In the case of the state VAT (ICMS), although a federal law should be followed, each state issues its own legislation, which brings certain differences when compared to the federal law.
The Brazilian indirect tax system comprises three key indirect taxes:
which are state, federal, and municipal taxes, respectively.
### VAT on Sales and Services (ICMS)
ICMS is a state tax on the circulation of merchandise, electric power, rendering of interstate and intermunicipal transportation services, and communications, even when the transaction and the rendering of services start in another country. It is not a cumulative tax, that is, the tax is only assessed on the increase in the price of the product in each part of the circulation process.
The calculation process involves a system where the taxpayer should check the amount of debits and credits related to the state VAT. In case the taxpayer upholds more debits than credits, the taxpayer will be required to pay tax on the difference between them.
In summary, the credits are calculated when the raw materials enter the taxpayer’s premises, and the debits are computed when the final product exits the establishment. Moreover, ICMS credits are not allowed for all acquisitions (e.g. use and consumptions items), and, as a rule, taxpayers are not allowed to account for credits on materials purchased that will be used as inputs for non-taxable goods (with some exceptions, such as exports).
ICMS is due on a monthly basis; however, on imports, ICMS is due on customs clearance.
The internal ICMS rates vary according to each State of Brazil, ranging, as a rule, from 17% to 20%. In the State of São Paulo, for example, ICMS is collected at an 18% rate. Certain products can attract a higher internal rate (such as 25%) or a lower internal rate (such as 12%). Different states may apply different rates according to the type of good as well as the nature of the operation.
Special rates apply to interstate sales, as shown in the chart below. A 4% rate applies on all interstate sales of imported goods.
| From (shipper) | To (addressee) | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| South and Southeast | South and Southeast | 12 |
| North, Northeast, and Midwest | Any Brazilian state | 12 |
| South and Southeast \* | North, Northeast, and Midwest \* | 7 |
\* Including the State of Espírito Santo.
#### ICMS-ST regime
In order to avoid illegal tax evasion, enhance the tax control processes, and facilitate tax collection, the legislation may appoint a single taxpayer of a product’s chain as the sole liable party, who will collect the ICMS due by all parties until the final consumer. The so-called ICMS-ST regime is imposed for certain goods as listed by each state tax legislation.
#### ICMS due on interstate sales of goods to final consumers
As a general rule, ICMS is collected by the state where the supplier of the goods is located. ICMS is collected by most states at internal rates ranging from 17% to 20% (some products attract a lower/higher rate). As noted above, special rates apply to interstate sales, which will be equivalent to 4%, 7%, or 12%, depending on the location of the supplier and client, as well as whether the goods are imported, have a certain content of imported inputs, or are domestically sourced.
The legislation determines that on interstate transactions with final consumers, the 4%, 7%, or 12% rates shall be applied (instead of the internal rate), and the difference between the internal and interstate rates shall be paid by the acquirer (transactions between ICMS taxpayers) or supplier (transactions involving non-ICMS taxpayers) of the goods to the consumer’s state.
### Excise Tax (IPI)
This Federal excise tax is paid by manufacturers on behalf of their customers at the time of sale, either to another manufacturer who will continue the manufacturing process or to the retailer who sells to the end user.
The tax paid is stated separately on the sales invoice, as is the nature of the goods involved. Certain exemptions are given to goods considered to be of basic necessity to the country's economy. The rates are defined by the product’s tariff code (normally around 5% to 30%, but in certain cases ranging to over 300%) and are in accordance with the essentiality of each product, which generally means that essential products will attract lower tax rates.
As mentioned above, when manufactured products are sold between producers, the IPI is imposed. However, the subsequent manufacturer is allowed a credit against its IPI liability, on the amount of IPI paid to its suppliers (non-cumulative tax, similar to what happens with ICMS). Furthermore, to retailers, IPI is not recoverable and is considered as a cost of the operation.
Imports of goods are also subject to IPI taxation, while exports are not.
IPI is due on a monthly basis; however, on imports, IPI is due on customs clearance.
### Municipal Service Tax (ISS)
The ISS is a municipal tax levied on the provision of services listed by Supplementary Law 116/2003. ISS is imposed on a cumulative basis (it is not creditable), and the rates may vary between 2% and 5%, depending on the type of service (rates to be stipulated on a municipal basis). The municipality to which the ISS must be collected to also changes depending on the nature of the service performed.
Concerning certain services, the municipal legislation may appoint the service recipient as the liable party, establishing its obligation to withhold ISS payment on behalf of the service provider.
Service import is also subject to ISS, to be collected by the Brazilian entity that is contracting the services from a supplier located abroad.
ISS is not levied on export of services. However, if the result of a certain service is verified in Brazil, ISS is imposed, even if the payment for such service is made by a non-resident. The definition of 'result', however, has not yet been pacified in Brazil.
## Import tax
The import duty (II) is a federal tax levied on permanent import of goods into Brazil and is also referred to as import tax or customs duty. The rates vary according to the product’s tariff code based on Mercosur Harmonised System (NCM/SH), usually ranging from 10% to 20% (there are some exceptions, but the maximum consolidated rate is 35%). As a general rule, the taxable basis consists of the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the product (i.e. cost, international insurance, and international freight), calculated pursuant to the World Trade Organization’s (WTO’s) Customs Valuation Agreement.
Import duty is not recoverable by the importer (i.e. it is considered a cost).
## Property taxes
A municipal property tax (IPTU) is levied annually based on the fair market value of property in urban areas at rates that generally vary according to the municipality and location of the property. In the municipality of São Paulo, the basic IPTU rate is 1% for residential properties or 1.5% for commercial properties (both rates may be increased or decreased according to the market value of the property).
## Transfer taxes
A municipal property transfer tax (ITBI) is levied on the transfer of immovable property, with rates also varying based on the municipality where the property is located. The ITBI rate in the municipality of São Paulo is currently 3%, applied over the market value of the property or the transaction price (whichever is higher).
A state property transfer tax (ITCMD) is normally payable at rates varying from state to state on inheritances and donations of goods and rights. In the state of São Paulo, ITCMD is charged at the rate of 4%.
## Tax on financial operations (IOF)
IOF is a tax levied on certain financial operations, such as loans, foreign exchange operations, insurance, and securities, as well as operations with gold (as a financial asset) and foreign exchange instruments. The applicable rate will vary depending on the operation. The IOF rate may be reduced to 0% in some cases, such as: (i) exchange operations relating to the inflow of revenues in Brazil deriving from the export of goods and services; (ii) exchange operations relating to the inflow and outflow of resources in and from Brazil, stemming from foreign loans; and (iii) remittances of interest on net equity and dividends relating to foreign investment.
## Social Contribution on Billing (COFINS)
COFINS, a monthly federal social assistance contribution calculated as a percentage of revenue, is levied at the rate of 7.6%. Under the non-cumulative method, a COFINS credit system is meant to ensure that the tax is applied only once on the final value of each transaction. However, some taxpayers (such as financial institutions, telecommunication companies, cooperatives, and companies that opt to calculate IRPJ and CSLL using a ‘presumed profits’ method) are subject to the cumulative method of COFINS system, which applies a rate of 3% with no credit system.
The general rates of COFINS may be reduced in certain circumstances (e.g. financial revenues may be subject to a rate of 0% or 4% depending on the nature of the transaction). Also, certain transactions are exempt from COFINS (e.g. exportation of services or assets are typically exempt where it results in funds entering Brazil).
Certain products may be subject to a single-phase taxation method, in which the legislation appoints a single taxpayer of a product’s chain as the sole liable party. These types of operations involve specific products listed by the legislation and usually involve a higher applicable tax rate.
## Contribution to the Social Integration Program (PIS)
PIS, which is also a federal social contribution calculated as a percentage of revenue, is levied at the rate of 1.65%. Under the non-cumulative method, a PIS credit system is meant to ensure that the tax is applied only once on the final value of each transaction. However, some taxpayers (such as financial institutions, telecommunication companies, cooperatives, and companies that opt to calculate IRPJ and CSLL using a ‘presumed profits’ method) are still subject to the cumulative method of PIS system, which applies a rate of 0.65% with no credit system.
The general rates of PIS may be reduced in certain circumstances (e.g. financial revenues may be subject to a rate of 0% or 0.65% depending on the nature of the transaction). Also, certain transactions are exempt from PIS (e.g. exportation of services or assets are typically exempt where it results in funds entering Brazil).
Certain products may be subject to a single-phase taxation method, in which the legislation appoints a single taxpayer of a product’s chain as the sole liable party. These types of operations involve specific products listed by the legislation and usually involve a higher applicable tax rate.
## PIS and COFINS on imports
Importation of goods and services are also subject to PIS and COFINS (in addition to other taxes imposed on import transactions). PIS and COFINS are generally imposed on the Brazilian entity or individual (the importer of goods or services) and should apply to the import of services at the rates of 1.65% and 7.6%, respectively.
PIS/COFINS rates on importation of goods, however, are 2.1% (PIS) and 9.65% (COFINS), respectively. Accordingly, the combined general rate for the import of goods is 11.75%. There are also increased rates for PIS and COFINS on importations of certain specific products, including pharmaceutical products; perfumes, cosmetics, and toiletries; machinery; and vehicles (under these cases, specific rates were provided). For the import of certain goods listed in the legislation, an additional 1% for COFINS is also applicable.
The contributions paid upon import transactions may, in some instances, be creditable.
## Payroll taxes
Legal entities incorporated in Brazil are subject to employer social costs, including: Social Security Contribution (INSS), Employees’ Severance Indemnity Fund (FGTS), work accident insurance (RAT), and variable contribution destined to 'third parties' engaged in social development activities (e.g. SENAI, SESC, SESI). As a general rule, INSS is due by the companies at a 20% rate over the employees’ payroll. However, certain entities may be eligible to calculate INSS at a range of 1% to 4.5%, applied on the company’s gross revenue rather than being calculated upon the company’s payroll (CPRB). In relation to FGTS, such contribution is levied on employee’s salary at the rate of 8%.
The employer is responsible to withhold income tax and social security contribution on behalf of the employee on a monthly basis.
## Contribution for Intervention in the Economic Domain (CIDE)
CIDE is a federal contribution levied at the rate of 10% on remittances made by corporate taxpayers for royalties and for administrative and technical services provided by non-residents. CIDE is payable by the local entity, and, therefore, not creditable to the non-resident. CIDE does not represent a liability to the foreign recipient. CIDE is not applied on the payments relating to the license to use, market, or sub-license software, provided that it does not involve transfer of technology, which is considered to be the transfer of the corresponding source code.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Taxable period
The Brazilian tax year covers the period from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Residents must file a tax return annually by the last business day of April of the following year, and no extension of time is allowed. In case of a late filing, penalties will be assessed by the tax authorities.
Since individual income tax is due and payable monthly, this return will account for only minor tax adjustments and will serve to list assets and liabilities. While there is no tax on assets owned, the government uses the list to check if the increase in the taxpayer's net worth is compatible with the reported income.
Spouses may elect to file tax returns jointly or separately. If filed separately, income received jointly must be allocated to each spouse's return. Also, in the section pertaining to assets and liabilities, each spouse must show the corresponding items held individually. The value of jointly held assets/liabilities should be allocated according to ownership percentage or shown only on one spouse's return. The spouse not listing the jointly held assets/liabilities must declare that the items will be listed on the other spouse's tax return.
The head of a household may treat as a dependant a spouse or any dependant (up to 24 years old who fulfils the dependant's rules) who receives taxable income, since the pertinent amounts are included in the income tax calculation basis.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is normally withheld at source, at rates varying from 0% to 27.5%, depending on the income bracket. The final liability is determined upon filing the tax return. Any difference between the amounts as determined by the tax return and that withheld at source or paid during the year by the individual must be paid or is refunded to the taxpayer. In case of any tax due, it must be paid to the Brazilian tax authorities at once or through up to eight monthly instalments, due on the last business day of April and in the succeeding months. In case the tax due is paid in instalments, interest must be considered monthly.
Taxes due on taxable capital gains arising from the sale of property must be collected through a tax voucher on or before the last working day of the month subsequent to sale in the case of resident taxpayer, or on the same day of sale in the case of a non-resident taxpayer.
If paid in Brazil, dividends are exempt from taxes whereas interest and royalties are taxed at source. If paid abroad, dividends and royalties are subject to taxation through the mandatory monthly income tax calculation whereas interest is taxable as capital gain. In both cases, the taxes due must be collected through a tax voucher on or before the last working day of the month subsequent to when the income was earned.
## Tax audit process
## Statute of limitations
The Brazilian tax authorities have up to five years, from 1 January of the year in which it is filed, to examine and question an individual income tax return.
The Brazilian tax authorities tend to question taxpayers whenever a tax credit and/or substantial amount of deductions are claimed in an individual income tax return.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
Residents of Brazil are taxed on their worldwide income, and non-residents are taxed exclusively at source on their Brazilian-sourced income. The source of income is determined by the place where the income payer is located, irrespective of where the work is performed.
For reference, non-resident taxpayers are taxed only on Brazilian-earned income at a flat rate of 25% (no deductions are allowed). Rental income received from a Brazilian-located property is taxed at 15%. Income receive abroad by non-residents is tax exempt.
## Personal income tax rates
Resident taxpayers who receive income from Brazilian sources are subject to withholdings. Resident taxpayers who receive income from non-Brazilian sources (e.g. through split payroll arrangement) or from individuals (e.g. rental income) are subject to mandatory monthly tax payments on amounts not subject to withholdings.
The monthly income tax will be calculated based on the following progressive tax rates (in Brazilian real or BRL) as of April 2015:
| Income at or over (BRL) | Up to (BRL) | Tax rate (%) | Deductible tax amount (BRL) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1,903.98 | Exempt | 0 |
| 1,903.99 | 2,826.65 | 7.5 | 142.80 |
| 2,826.66 | 3,751.05 | 15.0 | 354.80 |
| 3,751.06 | 4,664.68 | 22.5 | 636.13 |
| 4,664.68 | and above | 27.5 | 869.36 |
## **Alternative income taxes**
In December 2012, the Brazilian authorities issued PM 597/2012, converted into Law 12,832 (20 June 2013), altering Law 10,101/2000, which regulates profit sharing distributed to employees. The referred law established new rules, as follows:
| Annual profit sharing (BRL) | Tax rate (%) | Deductible tax amount (BRL) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 6,677.55 | 0 | 0 |
| 6,677.56 to 9,922.28 | 7.5 | 500.82 |
| 9,922.29 to 13,167.00 | 15.0 | 1,244.99 |
| 13,167.01 to 16,380.38 | 22.5 | 2,232.51 |
| Above 16,380.38 | 27.5 | 3,051.53 |
## Local income taxes
There are no provisions for local, state, or provincial income taxes in Brazil.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Brazil is the world’s fifth largest country. With an estimated population above 217 million, it is one of the world’s most populous countries, after China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan.
Brazil is divided into 27 federal units (26 states and the Federal District), including Brasilia as its capital. The official language of Brazil is Portuguese, and the currency is the real (BRL).
The Brazilian economy is considered large by almost any standard. Brazil is the eighth largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations.
Brazil has a diversified economy with strong companies in the agricultural, commodities, industrial, and service sectors; it has one of the biggest middle classes.
Recent years have been marked by significant economic and political challenges in Brazil. However, despite being considerably affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of economic indicators, its economy ended 2021 on a stronger footing than expected. GDP returned to growth in the final two months of the year, even as supply shortages were still hitting manufacturers.
Brazil implemented a labour reform in 2017, as well as a social security/pension reform in late 2019. Broader tax reform has been under discussion for the last three years, and, although the last bill was not approved, a tax reform is still being contemplated and expected to be implemented in the foreseeable future.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Brazilian resident companies are taxed on worldwide income. Non-resident companies are generally taxed in Brazil through a registered subsidiary, branch, or PE, based on income generated locally. Other than that, non-resident companies can be subject to withholding tax (IRRF) on income derived from a Brazilian source.
## Surcharge
Corporate taxpayers are also subject to a surcharge of 10% on the annual taxable income in excess of 240,000 Brazilian reais (BRL).
## Social Contribution on Net Income (CSLL)
Legal entities are generally subject to CSLL at the rate of 9% (except for some prescribed entities, such as financial institutions and private insurance companies, which are taxed at higher rates), which is not deductible for IRPJ purposes. The tax base is the profit before income tax, after some adjustments, depending on the calculation method (i.e. APM or PPM).
## Local income taxes
Corporate income taxes are levied only at the federal level (i.e. there are no state or municipal income taxes).

Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Social security contributions
All employees, self-employed individuals, and employers in Brazil are required to make contributions to the social security system.
Social security contributions due by employees are payable monthly, on Brazilian-source salary income, limited to a ceiling cap each month, according to the rates table, as outlined below.
Based on the Social Security Reform approved in November 2019, as of January 2021, employees will be subject to the payment of monthly social security contributions based on progressive rates from 7.5% up to 14% (resulting in a new cap amount of BRL 828.38), replacing the previous rates, as follows:
| Contribution salary from (BRL) | Up to (BRL) | Social security rate (%) | Ceiling contribution (BRL) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1,212.00 | 7.5 | - |
| 1,212.01 | 2,427.35 | 9 | - |
| 2,427.36 | 3,641.03 | 12 | - |
| 3,641.04 | 7,087.22 | 14 | 828.38 |
Social security contributions due by the employer are calculated considering a flat rate of 20% or 22.5%, depending on the industry's sector. In addition to the referred social security contribution, additional social charges are due by the employer, whose rate will depend on its economic activities.
Social security payable by self-employed individuals may be 5%, 11%, or 20% of the ceiling contribution salary, depending on specific conditions of the individual and of the services rendered.
## Corporate social contributions - Specific sectors
## Capital gains tax
The capital gain tax is applicable on the sale of real estate, vehicles and objects of art and collectibles sold in Brazil or abroad; on stocks sold in foreign markets, as well as on interest income received from investments located offshore. Non-residents are only subject to capital gains tax resulted from the sale of assets located in Brazil. The gain is calculated on the excess of the sale price over the cost of the asset sold at a tax rate of 15%. However, for tax residents in Brazil, there are certain exemptions applicable that must be observed.
It is also important to emphasise that, as of 1 January 2017, the portion of capital gain that exceeds BRL 5 million will be taxed at higher rates, ranging from 17.5% to the maximum rate of 22.5%, the latter applicable to the portion of capital gain that exceeds BRL 30 million.
## Capital gains tax on Brazilian Variable Incomes
Stocks sold in Brazilian markets or in the over the counter (OTC) market are subject to equity income taxation. Gains on the sale of stocks in the Brazilian stock exchange will be treated as equity income and will be taxed at a flat 15% rate, except for day-trade transactions which are taxed at 20%. There are also certain exemptions applicable that must be observed.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Brazil.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Donations, gifts, and inheritances are liable to taxation in Brazil via the Tax on Inheritances and Gifts (*Imposto sobre Transmissão Causa Mortis e Doações* or ITCMD). This is a state tax, which means its regime may vary from state to state in Brazil.
As a general rule, the ITCMD tax rate can reach up to 8%, calculated on the value of the assets or rights, or on the amount being transferred to someone.
## Property taxes
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury and excise taxes in Brazil.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
The IRRF rate applicable to payments for services, royalties, and interest to non-resident companies or individuals is generally 15% but can be increased to 25% in certain cases. Other transactional taxes also need to be considered on such payments.
Payments for services, royalties, and interest to non-resident companies located in a tax haven jurisdiction (black list only) are subject to IRRF at the rate of 25%.
The RFB issued guidance in relation to how they should treat certain service fees, which, in effect, allow certain payments to be exempt from IRRF in Brazil, under certain tax treaties.
Certain types of income paid by Brazilian companies to non-resident recipients are subject to IRRF as follows:
| Recipient | IRRF (%) (3) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties |

Notes
1. Note that the remittance of dividends is generally not subject to taxation in Brazil.
2. Treaty rates in excess of those in force for non-treaty countries are automatically reduced. The relevant treaty should be consulted on a case-by-case basis to confirm that the tax reduction is applicable in each case.
3. For treaties with multiple IRRF rates, the following rules generally apply:

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Brazilian taxpayers are subject to IRPJ and CSLL using an ‘actual profits’ method (i.e. APM - *Lucro Real*), which is based on taxable income (i.e. earnings before taxes or EBT), adjusted by certain additions and exclusions as determined by the legislation. The actual profit can be calculated annually or quarterly. For the annual calculation, the tax authorities collect anticipations during the year, as the taxpayer is required to calculate the income tax monthly.
Subject to certain restrictions (i.e. where gross income does not exceed BRL 78 million and depending on the activity), Brazilian taxpayers have the option to calculate IRPJ and CSLL using a ‘presumed profits’ method (i.e. PPM - *Lucro Presumido*). Under the PPM, the income is calculated on a quarterly basis on an amount equal to different percentages of gross revenue (i.e. based on the entity’s activities) and adjusted as determined by the prevailing legislation. Below we exemplify the main presumed profit rates that must be applied to determine the calculation basis:
| Activities | Presumed profit rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Retail sale of fuel and natural gas | 1.6 |
| Sale of goods or products | 8.0 |
| Cargo transportation |
| Real estate activities (purchase, sale, subdivision, development, and construction of real estate) |
| Hospital services |
| Rural activity |
| Industrialisation with materials supplied by the client |
| Other unspecified activities (except services) |
| Transportation services (except freight) | 16.0 |
| General services with gross revenues up to BRL 120,000/year (\*) |
| Professional services (Simple Societies [SS], doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, auditors, engineers, consultants, economists, etc.) | 32.0 |
| Business intermediation |
| Administration, lease, or assignment of movable/immovable property or rights |
| Construction services, when the provider does not use materials owned by it or is not responsible for the execution of the work. |
| Services in general, for which no specific percentage is established |
| In the case of exploration of diversified activities, the respective percentage will be applied to the gross revenue of each activity. | 1.6 to 32.0 |
\* Not applied to legal entities engaged in the performance of hospital activities or transportation services, as well as the professional services societies.
## Inventory valuation
## Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the sale of assets and rights, including shares/quotas, are generally taxed as ordinary income.
Carried forward capital losses may be offset only against capital gains. Unused capital losses are treated similarly to income tax losses with regard to limits on use and carryforward period. Capital losses may be used to offset other operating income in the year that they are incurred.
Capital gains derived by non-residents (including transactions carried out abroad between two non-resident investors, involving assets or rights located in Brazil) may be taxed in Brazil.
Such gains should be subject to progressive income tax rates, which range from 15% (for capital gain that does not exceed BRL 5 million) to 22.5% (for the portion of the gain that exceeds BRL 30 million), as per the table below:
| Capital gain (BRL) | | Income tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 5 million | 15.0 |
| 5 million | 10 million | 17.5 |
| 10 million | 30 million | 20.0 |
| 30 million |  | 22.5 |
For beneficiaries residing in tax haven jurisdictions, the rate applicable remains at 25%, irrespective of the amount of the gain, due to an explicit provision in the law for these situations.
Exemptions from capital gains taxation may be available for specific transactions (e.g. certain regulated investments on the Brazilian stock market).
## Dividend income
In general terms, no IRRF is due on cash dividends or profits paid or credited to either corporate or individual shareholders. Brazilian resident beneficiaries are not subject to further income tax on receipt of dividends.
## Financial income
Fixed-rate interest income from short, medium, or long-term financial market transactions, including swap transactions, is subject to IRRF at rates ranging from 15% to 22.5%. Non-fixed financial gains related to stock/commodities exchange and/or futures market transactions are taxed at rates of 20% (day-trade) and 15% (all other cases). For legal entities, the total income or gain is considered taxable income, and the tax withheld may be offset against the total tax due by the corporate taxpayer.
Additionally, PIS/COFINS may be levied at a rate of up to 4.65%, depending on the type of transactions and taxation regime (i.e. non-cumulative method).
## Royalty income
Under Brazilian tax legislation, royalties are defined as the remuneration agreed between contracting parties for the use or exploration of:
Royalty income should be subject to regular corporate income taxation in Brazil.
## Foreign currency exchange gain/loss
With respect to foreign currency exchange gain/loss, which may arise from receivables or liabilities denominated in foreign currency, Brazilian tax legislation allows the local company to elect to consider the related effect, for tax computation purposes, either upon an accrual or cash basis (i.e. actual receipt/payment of funds).
## Foreign income
Brazilian resident companies are taxed on worldwide income. *See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](brazil/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (STF) confirms that the ICMS (State VAT) should not be included in the taxable basis of PIS and COFINS (Federal VATs)
The STF concluded the long-awaited judgment of the motion for clarification in the process in which it was determined that the ICMS amount informed by the companies in their invoices should not be included in the taxable basis of the PIS and COFINS.
## Brazilian Double Tax Treaties (DTTs) recently ratified
In recent years, Brazil has signed new DTTs with Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and Uruguay, all of which have already been internalised.
At the same time, continuous changes have been made to the current treaties, which had their texts revised and updated, as is the case of the treaties with Sweden, Chile, China, and Norway.
Furthermore, Brazil has also signed or ratified DTTs with Colombia, Poland, and the United Kingdom (UK). Such DTTs, however, are not yet in force.
## ICMS (State VAT) rate restrictions on operations with fuels, electrical power, and telecommunications
In November 2021, the STF decided that higher ICMS rates for operations involving electrical power and telecommunications are not in line with the selectivity nature of this tax, as adopted by the State legislators, due to the essentiality of said items in daily life (as observed in *Recurso Extraordinário* nº 714.139).
Considering the expected financial impact to the Public Treasury of the decision above, the STF decided to modulate the effects of its decision to start only in 2024.
Nevertheless, in March 2022, the Brazilian National Congress presented Bill nº 18/2022, which aimed to change Brazilian federal legislation to consider fuels, electrical power, telecommunications, and public transportation as essential goods and services, imposing restrictions to the Brazilian States concerning the ICMS rates adopted.
Following an expedited procedure in the National Congress, in June 2022, the Bill was approved and converted into Supplementary Law nº 194/2022 with its effects starting as of the date of publication.
As a result of the changes set forth by the federal legislation mentioned above, some Brazilian States have already started to issue tax rules in order to regulate the applicable ICMS rates for these items.
## New transfer pricing rules
On 29 December 2022, the Brazilian government issued the Provisional Measure (MP) 1152/22 seeking alignment with the arm’s-length principle in accordance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The MP was amended and ratified by the Congress, a process that was concluded on 10 May 2023. Afterwards, the MP was converted into Law 14,596, published on 15 June 2023.
Law 14,596 is mostly principles-based and delegates substantial authority to regulations issued and to be issued by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office (RFB), through Normative Instructions (INs).
IN/RFB 2,161/2023, the first set of regulations to rule Law 14,596/23, provides guidance on the interpretations of the arm’s-length principle, related parties, controlled transactions, delineation of transactions, methods, and documentation (the procedures related to the filings of the reports, among other measurements and future implementation of transfer pricing return); however, it does not regulate important ’specific provisions‘ from the new law that, as per the RFB, will be addressed in future INs.
## Brazil VAT / excise reform
On December 20, 2023, the Brazilian Congress enacted the VAT reform representing a historic milestone for Brazil, beginning the long-awaited modernization of its complex and uncompetitive tax system.
The main changes were the elimination of 4 taxes (Social Security Financing Contribution - COFINS, Contribution to the Social Integration Program - PIS, State Indirect Tax - ICMS, Local Services Tax - ISS), reduction of the general IPI (Federal Tax on Manufactured
Products) rate to zero and the creation of 3 new taxes: Federal Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS), Subnational Tax on Goods and Services (IBS) (States and Municipalities) and Federal Excise Tax (IS).
The transition period will be marked by a coexistence of two tax systems with old and new taxes collected in parallel for 7 years:
After the transition period, the expected simplification and rationalization of the consumption tax regime is expected to be achieved, since the VAT reform:
It is worth mentioning that the legislation will still be the subject of many discussions within the scope of elaboration of the Complementary Laws required for its full regulation.
## Partial adoption of Pillar 2 via Additional CSLL (QDMTT)
Provisional Measures have the immediate force of federal laws but need to be ratified (or
modified or rejected) and "converted" into ordinary federal law by Congress within up to 120 days.
Out of the four GloBE (Global Anti-Base Erosion) rules, Brazil currently proposes to adopt only one, while it maintains its full-inclusion regime ("TBU") which applies the full domestic rate annually, without deferral, to all income earned not only by Controlled Foreign Companies (CFCs) but also partly owned subsidiaries.
If approved as currently designed, the Additional CSLL will apply as from January 1st, 2025, however its payment is to be made only by the last business day of the seventh month following the end of the fiscal year – July 2026 for the 2025, and so on.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
A legal entity is considered resident in Brazil if it has been incorporated in Brazil, and its tax domicile is where its head office is located.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The specific term ‘permanent establishment’ is not included in the Brazilian legislation, rather there is a concept of ‘taxable presence’.
In general, a non-resident company may be treated as having a taxable presence if it operates in Brazil either through: (i) a fixed place of business or (ii) an agent who has the power to enter into contracts in Brazil in the name of or on behalf of the non-resident.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is allowable on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. The annual rates provided by the RFB normally allowable are 10% for machinery, equipment, furniture, and installations; 20% for vehicles; and 4% for buildings. Accelerated depreciation is allowed for companies with a two or three working shift operation by increasing normal rates by 50% and 100%, respectively.
Depletion allowances are allowed for natural resources on a useful-life basis. Special incentive depletion allowances are granted for mining and oil & gas operations.
For Brazilian accounting purposes, companies should generally perform or obtain a useful life study for fixed assets in order to determine the acceptable depreciation rates. For tax purposes, the depreciation considered deductible for the corporate income tax computation is generally determined based on the application of the annual depreciation rate for accounting purposes over the asset’s acquisition cost. In cases where the depreciation registered in the books of the company is lower than that calculated based on the depreciation charts issued by the Brazilian Revenue Service, the difference can be excluded from the company’s taxable income calculation made under the actual profits method.
## Goodwill
Under certain requirements, goodwill paid upon the acquisition of the shares or quotas of a permanent investment may be amortised for tax purposes before realisation/impairment occurs (e.g. after a merger or a spin-off). It is important to note that the amortisation of goodwill is not permitted in Brazil for accounting purposes.
Whenever the cost of a share acquisition is higher than the net equity value of the acquired company, the acquisition cost of the investments should be segregated into:
1. the net equity of the acquired company
2. the fair value of the net assets, and
3. the goodwill deriving from future profitability, which corresponds to the remaining balance from items (i) and (ii).
Upon a merger between buyer and acquired company (downstream or upstream), the amount of goodwill can be amortised for tax purposes over a period of not less than five years, provided certain conditions are complied with.
Taxpayers wishing to continue to apply the previous rules for goodwill amortisation in relation to acquisitions made on or before 31 December 2014 had until 31 December 2017 to complete the merger of the target and the acquiring entity.
Amortisation of patents, trademarks, and copyrights, based on their useful life, is a deductible expense within approved limits.
## Start-up expenses
As a general rule, for tax purposes, start-up/pre-operational expenses may be deferred and amortised on the straight-line basis over a period of not less than five years, beginning the month in which the business starts operating.
For purposes of corporate income tax calculation based on the actual profits method, the following expenses shall not be computed within the period in which they are incurred: (i) start-up organisation expenses, including from the initial operation phase, when the company only partially used its equipment or its installations and (ii) expenses for expansion of industrial activities.
The expenses mentioned above shall be excluded for purposes of computation under the actual profits method, based on a minimum period of five years, as of the beginning of the regular operations.
At the option of the company, R&D expenditures may be deducted when incurred or deferred until termination of the project and then amortised over a period of not less than five years.
R&D expenses may be excluded, for purposes of computation based on the actual profits method, when registered as non-current asset intangibles, during the computation period in which they were incurred. To use this benefit, the taxpayer must add to the net income, for purposes of computation based on the actual profits method, any amount previously recognised for the relevant intangible asset, through amortisation, sale, or write-off.
## Interest on net equity (INE)
Companies can pay interest (calculated on a *pro rata* basis and up to a given rate, known as the ‘long-term interest rate’ [TJLP], which is currently set at 6.91%/year) to share/quota holders, based on the company’s net equity. Such interest, which may not exceed the higher of 50% of the annual profits or 50% of the accumulated earnings and profits, is deductible for both IRPJ and CSLL purposes and is subject to 15% IRRF at the source (or 25% if the beneficiary is located in a tax haven jurisdiction). Whenever the beneficiary is a legal entity subject to normal income tax in Brazil, the tax withheld at the source may be taken by the recipient as a tax credit. If the beneficiary is a Brazilian resident individual, such interest will not become subject to any further taxation.
## Interest and other payments to entities in a tax haven or under a privileged tax regime
Provisions similar to those for thin capitalisation (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*) are also applicable to interest paid or credited by a Brazilian entity to an individual or legal entity (whether or not a related party) resident or domiciled in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction under a privileged tax regime. In these cases, the interest expense is only deductible for Brazilian income tax purposes if it is viewed as necessary to the company’s activities and the total amount of the Brazilian entity’s debt with any foreign party resident or domiciled in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction under a privileged tax regime does not exceed 30% of the Brazilian entity's net equity.
### Tax havens and privileged tax regime lists
The RFB has issued a list (i.e. ‘black list’) detailing the jurisdictions that are considered not to tax income or to tax it at a rate lower than 20%, or that deny access to information regarding shareholding and ownership of assets and rights.
Another list (i.e. ‘grey list’) contemplates jurisdictions that are considered to have ‘privileged tax regimes’, as set forth in Brazilian legislation. The following types of entities are included in the grey list:
A foreign holding company is deemed to carry out substantive economic activities if it has, in its country of domicile, operating capacity to manage and make decisions regarding (i) activities with the purpose of generating income from its assets or (ii) management of equity interests with the purpose of generating income in the form of profit distributions and capital gains.
Operating capacity should be measured by (i) the existence of physical facilities and (ii) qualified employees to manage and make decisions according to the complexity of the tasks to be performed. It is important to note that the definition only expressly makes reference to Dutch and Danish holding companies although it also could be considered to apply to Austrian holding companies.
It is generally understood that the concept of a privileged tax regime is subject to stricter transfer pricing, thin capitalisation, and tax deduction rules. There are also a number of adverse implications from a Brazilian CFC perspective. For the jurisdictions considered tax havens, in addition to the tax consequences applicable for privileged tax regimes above, the IRRF rate due on capital gains and cross-border payments, such as services fees, royalties, and interest, is generally 25%.
In 2014, an NI issued by the RFB reduced from 20% to 17% the minimum income tax rate used as a reference to list the tax havens and privileged tax regimes. This threshold was reduced for jurisdictions and regimes aligned to the ’international standards of fiscal transparency‘; however, jurisdictions that meet such requirements are not automatically excluded from the black or grey lists.
## Bad debt
Losses on bad debts are tax deductible, depending on the amounts, time overdue, and administrative and/or legal actions taken to recover losses. Losses arising from inter-company transactions are not tax deductible.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are deductible, up to certain limits, if recipients are registered as charitable institutions.
## Travel expenses
Travel expenses may only be considered deductible if they are incurred in connection with business activities, duly documented and substantiated.
## Medical and pension expenses
Expenses of group medical care and health insurance programmes for employees and contributions to private supplementary pension schemes are generally considered deductible if supplied to all employees indiscriminately.
## Fines and penalties
Punitive tax/contribution penalties are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes/contributions
Taxes, contributions, and related costs, such as late-payment interest, are generally deductible for tax purposes on an accrual basis. This rule does not apply to taxes/contributions being or to be challenged by the taxpayer at any level of litigation, which are deductible for tax purposes only on a cash basis.
## Tax losses carried forward
Tax losses (i.e. for IRPJ and CSLL purposes) may be carried forward without any time limitation. However, the tax loss may not reduce taxable income by more than 30% of its amount prior to the compensation of the tax loss itself (and is subject to certain loss recoupment rules).
There is no carryback of tax losses or monetary restatement.
## Payments to foreign affiliates and related companies
Royalties and technical service fees (with a transfer of technology or know-how) payable to foreign companies with a direct or indirect controlling interest in the Brazilian company are deductible for tax purposes (observing applicable deduction limits), provided the contract has been duly registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (*Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial* or INPI) and approved by the Brazilian Central Bank.
## Payments under so-called "cost-sharing arrangements"
Reimbursements paid under the Brazilian so-called "cost-sharing arrangements" (reimbursement of costs) may be considered deductible for IRPJ and CSLL purposes, to the extent that certain requirements set forth by administrative decisions (especially tax ruling COSIT 8/2012) are met by the company performing such payments.

# Brazil
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Consolidated tax returns are not permitted in Brazil.
## Transfer pricing (applicable until 31 December 2023)
The Brazilian transfer pricing rules apply to import and export transactions of goods, services, and rights between related parties (the legislation provides a broad list of the parties considered as ‘related’ for transfer pricing purposes). Under such rules, the price determined between related parties shall be acceptable, for Brazilian tax purposes, if it is in accordance with one of the transfer pricing methods established by the legislation (no profit methods are available). Since there is no best method approach, taxpayers can choose the least onerous alternative for each good, service, or right on an annual basis (except in cases involving listed commodities). Moreover, all transactions with both tax havens and those subject to privileged tax regimes are subject to transfer pricing rules, whether involving related parties or not.
### Interest
Brazilian transfer pricing rules are applicable to interest derived from/charged to inter-company loans and/or with entities situated in low-tax jurisdictions, and such interest must comply with the rates established below, in addition to a spread determined by the Ministry of Finance, in order to be acceptable for tax deductibility purposes:
1. In case of transaction in US dollars, subject to a fixed interest rate: Rate of Brazilian sovereign bonds issued in US dollars in foreign markets.
2. In case of transaction in Brazilian reais, subject to a fixed interest rate: Rate of Brazilian sovereign bonds issued in Brazilian reais in foreign markets.
3. In all other cases (e.g. euros): LIBOR for the period of six months.
The additional spread is currently set at 3.5% per year, applicable to interest due to foreign-related parties or to low-tax jurisdictions, and 2.5% per year, in case of interest charged by the Brazilian entity.
For transactions covered in item (iii) above, in currencies for which there is no specific LIBOR, the LIBOR for deposits in US dollars shall be the one to be considered.
### Royalties
Operations involving royalties registered with the National Institute of Intellectual Property should not generally be subject to transfer pricing rules.
### Services/Goods/Rights
Methods available for documenting the import transactions:
Methods available for documenting the export transactions:
Relief of proof rules (materiality and profitability safe harbours) for inter-company export transactions are available.
Please note that imports and exports of commodities, quoted in commodities exchange markets, must be tested by the use of specific methods called PCI and PECEX, respectively. Based on these methods, taxpayers shall compare the transaction amounts with the daily average quote for each product.
Taxpayers should prepare the transfer pricing analysis in accordance with the provisions of Law 9,430/96 and further amendments, as well as respective guidelines from the tax administration, mainly substantiated in IN/RFB 1,312/12. Please note that substantial changes related to the tested price and parameter price analysis were made through the more recent IN 1,870/19.
## Transfer pricing (mandatory for 2024 onwards, optional for 2023)
As defined by law, the application of the new rules is optional for fiscal year 2023 (retroactively for transactions as of 1 January 2023) but will be mandatory for fiscal year 2024 (starting at 1 January 2024). The deadline for exercising this early adoption option is 31 December 2023.
In June 2023, the Brazilian government converted the MP 1152/22 into Law 14,596, which aligns the Brazilian transfer pricing rules with the arm’s-length principle in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
The new legislation is mostly principles-based and delegates substantial authority to regulations to be issued by the RFB through INs.
The main aspects of the new legislation are summarised below, but a detailed analysis of the new transfer pricing system is highly recommended:
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Although Brazil recently introduced the obligation to present the CbC report, it has not yet imposed the obligation to file either the Master or the Local file.
## Thin capitalisation
The Brazilian thin capitalisation rules establish that interest paid or credited by a Brazilian entity to a related party (individual or legal entity), resident or domiciled abroad, not constituted in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction with a privileged tax regime, may only be deducted for income tax purposes if the interest expense is viewed as necessary for the activities of the local entity and the following requirements are met:
1. the amount of debt granted by the foreign-related party (which has participation in the Brazilian entity) does not exceed twice the amount of its participation in the net equity of the Brazilian entity
2. the amount of debt granted by a foreign-related party (which does not have participation in the Brazilian entity) does not exceed twice the amount of the net equity of the Brazilian entity
3. the total amount of debt granted by foreign-related parties as per (i) and (ii) does not exceed twice the sum of participation of all related parties in the net equity of the Brazilian entity, and
4. in case debt is only granted by related parties that do not have a participation in the Brazilian entity, the total amount of debt granted by all of these related parties does not exceed twice the amount of the Brazilian entity’s net equity.
Consequently, if one of the mentioned 2:1 ratios is exceeded, the portion of interest related to the excess debt amount will not be deductible for Brazilian income tax purposes.
Similar provisions are also applicable to interest paid or credited by a Brazilian entity to an individual or legal entity (whether or not a related party) resident or domiciled in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction subject to a privileged tax regime. In these cases, the ratio reduces to 30% of the Brazilian entity's net equity (0.3:1 ratio).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Law No. 12,973/2014 introduced rules for the treatment of controlled and affiliated companies for Brazilian CFC purposes.
Taxpayers will be allowed to consolidate positive and negative adjustments until 2024, provided certain conditions are satisfied as defined by the legislation (the initial term was 2022, which was then postponed to 2024).
One of the requirements introduced by the legislation is related to the concept of the sub-taxation jurisdiction, which is defined as being a jurisdiction that has a nominal income tax rate of less than 20%. In order to be able to consolidate, a company cannot be subject to a sub-taxation regime, in addition to not being subject to a privileged tax regime or resident in a tax haven (or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such entities).
In case the taxpayer does not choose to consolidate its accounting losses, losses will only be compensated by the foreign controlled entity with its own future profits. Accumulated losses accrued before the above-mentioned law may also be used to offset profits without any time limitation, subject to appropriate disclosure.
Under certain conditions, taxpayers may choose to pay income tax due on the foreign profits proportionally to the profits actually distributed to the Brazilian entity, in subsequent periods to that in which such results were generated. However, in the first year, even where there is no distribution of profits, 12.5% of profits will be deemed to be distributed to the Brazilian parent. If no further profits are distributed, the remaining profits will be deemed to be distributed in the eighth subsequent year. Taxpayers choosing to postpone payment of income tax due should consider the impact of interest as well as foreign exchange rates.
In addition to corporate taxes paid, the law expressly extends foreign tax credits to withholding income tax paid abroad on the profits distributed to the Brazilian parent.
For affiliated companies, the law does not require adjustments to the Brazilian entity’s accounts but rather focuses on the profits distributed. Profits will be considered distributed to the parent when credited or paid or in other specific circumstances defined by the legislation. As such, any profits earned by a Brazilian entity through a foreign affiliate will generally only be taxable in Brazil on 31 December of the year in which they were actually distributed to the Brazilian entity, provided that the affiliate satisfies certain conditions defined by the legislation, including not being located in a low-tax jurisdiction.
The CFC rules will not apply for directly or indirectly controlled foreign entities and affiliates in case of activities related to the exploration of oil and gas in Brazil.
Until calendar year 2024, Brazilian parent companies may deduct up to 9% as a presumed/deemed credit on the CFC’s taxable profit, generated by investments abroad that are engaged in the manufacture of food and beverage products and in the construction of building/infrastructure works (the initial term was 2022, which was then postponed to 2024).
This list of activities has been extended to include manufacturing, mineral extraction, exploitation, under public concession contracts, of public assets located in the country of residence of the CFC entity, as well as other general industry.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Brazilian resident companies are taxed on worldwide income, but they may offset the income tax paid in the country of domicile of the branch, controlled, or associated company, and the tax paid on earnings and capital gains, against the corporate income tax due in Brazil. The amount of tax effectively paid abroad, to be offset, may not exceed the amount of income tax and surtax due in Brazil on the amount of profits, earnings, and capital gains included in the calculation of taxable income.
## Investment project incentives
Total or partial exemption from duty, excise tax, and social contributions on imported equipment is granted on certain approved investment projects.
Approved investment projects are also granted accelerated depreciation on nationally produced equipment and access to low-cost financing. Sales of some capital equipment are exempt from state sales tax.
Brazilian corporate taxpayers can recover a portion of their income tax and social contributions taxes on revenues (PIS/COFINS) based on investment in their own approved investment projects. These approved investment projects are normally granted total or partial income tax exemption. As of December 2023, MP 1,185/23  was converted into Law 14,789/23, effective as of January 2024, and it changes the means and limits for such tax relief.
The Brazilian legislation also provides tax incentives for projects focusing on technological innovation.
## Program for Investment Partnerships
The Program for Investment Partnerships (*Programa de Parcerias de Investimentos* or PPI) intends to amplify and strengthen the interaction between the Brazilian state and private sector through partnership agreements to carry out public infrastructure projects.
PPIs can be used for (i) public infrastructure projects that are already under way or to be performed through partnership agreements to be signed by the direct or indirect bodies of the Brazilian federal government; (ii) public infrastructure projects to be performed through partnerships signed by the government of states or municipalities directly or indirectly, but delegated or fomented by the federal government; and (iii) other measures established by the National Privatization Plan, per law 9,491/97.
## Regional incentives
Income tax exemptions or reductions are also available for companies set up in specified regions within Brazil, primarily the north and northeast regions. These incentives are designed to accelerate the development of certain less-developed regions and industries considered to be of importance to the economy.
## ICMS tax incentives - State tax incentives / benefits
According to the Federal legislation (Complementary Law 24/1975), the ICMS tax incentives or similar tax benefits granted by an individual state should be approved by all states through an agreement with the National Council of Fiscal Policy (CONFAZ). However, such tax incentives were usually granted by the states without this formal acceptance. As a result, ICMS tax incentives, granted in such terms, were or could be challenged by the other states, claiming the unconstitutionality of the incentive.
In 2017, the Brazilian Congress approved the validation of all ICMS tax incentives currently granted by the Brazilian states to taxpayers. In practical terms, such validation will sort out the so-called 'tax war' in which any state would not be able to challenge going forward the unconstitutionality of any ICMS tax incentive already granted at the Supreme Court level. It is worth mentioning that, if the VAT reform currently under discussion is approved, such incentives will remain in force until the end of the transition period (i.e. December 2032), being gradually reduced over the years.
In this sense, all states have listed their ICMS tax incentives in order to be valid as per the applicable tax legislation (Complementary Law 160/2017 and CONFAZ Agreement 190/2017). Until each of such incentives is valid, other states may grant similar tax incentives of any other state to their taxpayers in order to achieve tax equality.
Under the new VAT tax system, the "Compensation Fund for Tax or Financial-Tax Benefits of ICMS" will be established to compensate, by December 31, 2032, the legal entities benefiting from exemptions, incentives, and tax or financial benefits related to ICMS, granted for a certain period and under defined conditions. The criteria will be established by Complementary Law.
## Other incentives
In addition, certain excise and sales tax exemptions are granted to exporters of manufactured goods.

# Brazil
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Since June 2014, the RFB has closely followed the discussions of the G20/OECD BEPS project and adopted a series of measures in relation to the minimum standards proposed by the BEPS Action Plans. As a result of the formal request from Brazil to join the OECD as a full member in 2017, additional developments in relation to other OECD BEPS initiatives have been implemented.
### Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance (MCAA)
Although not strictly developed under the BEPS project, the MCAA, signed by Brazil and in force since October 2016, provides a platform for automatic and on-demand exchange of information between tax authorities of different jurisdictions.
Under the umbrella of the MCAA, Brazil has signed two Multilateral Competent Authority Agreements, which will allow tax authorities to automatically exchange financial information (CRS MCAA) and country-by-country reportings (CbC MCAA).
### Common reporting standards (CRS)
On 29 December 2016, the RFB issued the final regulations in relation to the implementation of the CRS in Brazil. The regulations define the relevant information that should be exchanged, including information on financial assets, as well as the specific procedures that should be followed by the financial institutions that will present the report starting in 2018.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
On 29 December 2016, the RFB issued the final regulations in relation to the implementation of the CbC reporting, establishing the framework under which multinational enterprises (MNEs) are required to disclose information in Brazil related to their economic activities worldwide. The information has been disclosed on the Corporate Income Tax Return (ECF) since 2017.
### Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)
RFB issued Normative Instruction 1669/2016 laying out the rules to allow taxpayers to access the MAP. Although Brazil had included Article 25 of the OECD Model Convention (related to MAP provision) in its Double Tax Treaties, before NI 1669/2016 there were no specific procedures to access this resource. On 28 November 2018, NI 1669/2016 was revoked by NI 1846/2018, which added a few additional clarifications for the MAP.
In December 2018, a manual for the MAP was published by the tax authorities, further illustrating the processes to be followed in order to make use of the MAP.
### Multilateral Convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS (MLI)
Brazil has not signed the MLI, but has started to include the minimum anti-abusive standards in its newly negotiated treaties.
### Exchange of information of Brazilian Rulings
Normative Instruction 1689/2017 introduces the compulsorily exchange of information on tax rulings rule, which according to the RFB should include '*solução de consulta'*, '*solução de divergência',* and '*ato declaratório interpretativo'*. The exchange of information should be restricted to transfer pricing, PE, or the PADIS tax benefit.
## Brazilian pension reform bill in 2019
Brazil has a historical public debt issue related to the public pension regime, which has begun to be reformed for upcoming years. After considerable discussion during past years, a reform was approved in 2019.
The reform has established certain measures to reduce the current social security deficit, such as raising the minimum retirement age and reducing or restructuring some of the benefits currently available to workers, both from private companies as well as civil workers.
It should be noted that a transition regime is currently in force, designed to capture the situation of the workers and employees who had already started to contribute to the public pension regime but had not yet officially retired.
## Ongoing Brazilian tax reform proposals
As a result, a tax reform has always been discussed, but it was not until 2019 and with a new presidential term starting that such discussions got more tangible.
On December 20, 2023, the Brazilian Congress enacted the VAT reform representing a historic milestone for Brazil, beginning the long-awaited modernization of its complex and uncompetitive tax system.
The main changes were the elimination of 4 taxes (Social Security Financing Contribution - COFINS, Contribution to the Social Integration Program - PIS, State Indirect Tax - ICMS, Local Services Tax - ISS), reduction of the general IPI (Federal Tax on Manufactured
Products) rate to zero and the creation of 3 new taxes: Federal Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS), Subnational Tax on Goods and Services (IBS) (States and Municipalities) and Federal Excise Tax (IS).
The transition period will be marked by a coexistence of two tax systems with old and new taxes collected in parallel for 7 years

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Foreign tax relief
Tax credits are available with respect to income tax paid to countries with which Brazil has a ratified tax treaty or to countries that would render reciprocal treatment in relation to income tax paid to the Brazilian government, provided that some requirements are met.
## Tax treaties
Brazil signed tax treaties to avoid double taxation with the following countries: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia (\*), Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay (\*), Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad & Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay (\*), and Venezuela.
(\*) Treaties pending ratification (not yet in force).
In the case of the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, the Brazilian authorities have already officially recognised the reciprocity of tax treatment, which permits the offsetting of the tax paid in those countries against the tax due in Brazil, on the same earnings.
Brazil maintains the following totalisation agreements:
The following totalisation agreements are in progress (not yet in force):

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
Brazil is negotiating new totalisation agreements (*see the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for more information*), including Bulgaria, China, India, Switzerland, and the Portuguese speaking countries Multilateral Agreement (Brazil, Angola, Cabo Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, and East Timor).
Regarding the report of overseas assets in Brazil (Annual Income Tax Return and Brazilian Central Bank reporting), there is an Agreement between the Brazil and the United States (US) whose main objective is the exchange of financial information between the countries. This occurs through the tax authorities, which can exchange data with regards to balances in checking and saving accounts, earnings from financial investments, brokers, and insurance accounts. Further information (e.g. information related to real estate purchased abroad by Brazilians) may also be requested, but is not automatically provided.
On 14 January 2016, the Special Regime of Taxation and Foreign Currency Regularisation was established, which creates a legal mechanism for voluntary declaration by individuals and companies of their assets located outside the country that were not declared or were declared incorrectly. For regularisation, the taxpayer must bear a tax burden of approximately 30% of the assets amount. The deadline to avail of the regime finished on 31 October 2016.
Law 13,429, in force as of 30 March 2017, brought a second version of the Special Regime of Taxation and Foreign Currency Regularisation for those who have not benefited in the first stage. In this second phase, for regularisation, the taxpayer must bear a tax burden of approximately 35% of the assets amount. The deadline to avail of the regime finished on 31 July 2017.
The eSocial implementation started on 1 January 2018 for companies with revenue in 2016 that has surpassed 78 million Brazilian reais (BRL). For other companies, the implementation started in July 2018.
New Law 13,467/2017 amends the Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT) and adjusts various legal rules applicable to labour relationships. The newly introduced rules entered into force on 11 November 2017. Given their importance, companies should give these rules special attention due to their potential impacts on international assignment processes and costs.
The ‘New Migration Law’ (Law 13,445 issued in May 2017) has formally revoked the ‘Foreigner Statute Law’ (Law 6,815/1980), defining the rights and duties of Brazilian migrants and the legal situation of foreign individuals in Brazil. The main purpose of the new legislation is to ensure equal rights and opportunities to foreigners as if they are Brazilians citizens, as well as simplify the procedures for entrance and residence in Brazil. With respect to the latter, the Law has created new types and characteristics for allowable visas, extended the coverage conditions for the temporary visa, and introduced a new authorisation for residence.
Normative Instruction (NI) 1,831/2018, published by the Brazilian tax authorities on 21 September 2018, deals with procedures of customs control and tax treatment applicable to the traveller's goods and aims to improve and simplify the procedures adopted in the entrance of the goods of the return traveller to the country.
On 23 November 2018, the Brazilian IRS published the 16th version of the Income Tax Regulation thru the Decree 9,580/2018.
On 12 November 2019, the Brazilian government promulgated the Social Security Reform though the Constitutional Amendment (EC) n. 103. The new legislation has changed the social security system in Brazil, introducing, among other aspects, new rates for the individual social security contributions and new rules for granting pension benefits.
Based on the Law 13,932/2019, the government has extinguished the social contribution due by companies in cases of employee's dismissal without just cause. This charge, previously calculated at 10% on the total deposits made by the employer to the employee's Severance Indemnity Fund (*Fundo de Garantia por tempo de Serviço* or FGTS) account during the employment relationship, ceases to exist as of 1 January 2020.
In June 2021, the Brazilian government proposed a tax reform that will change some rules regarding individual taxation, affecting both company and personal income. This is still being discussed in the Brazilian Congress.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Personal deductions
For Brazilian tax legislation purposes, the following items can be deducted from an employee's annual taxable income:
Please observe that some deductions, such as those for dependants, alimony, and Brazilian official social security contributions are allowed on a monthly basis.
The taxpayer may also deduct from the tax due, and not from the calculation base, the following:
## Standard deduction
In lieu of the above itemised deductions, taxpayers may take the benefit of a standard annual deduction (20% of gross taxable income, limited to a certain specific amount established each year by the tax authorities: BRL 16,754.34 since 2015, with no changes up to 2020). The option for a standard deduction is not allowed on exit returns or for those individuals who will offset losses from farming activities in the annual income tax return.
Note that all deductions must be claimed in the year they are incurred. They cannot be carried back and/or forward.
## Business deductions
Individuals who receive income from work without an employment relationship may deduct the following from the income received:
Note that the items above must be included in a specific section of the Brazilian income tax return, and the individual must keep the documentation.
There are no existing provisions in Brazil for the deductibility of the following items:

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Visas
The Brazilian Migration Law (Law 13,445), in force as of 21 November 2017, formally revoked the ‘Foreigner Statute Law' (Law 6,815/1980), defining the rights and obligations of foreign individuals in Brazil, either as residents or visitors.
Brazilian authorities may grant visit or temporary visas to foreigners who intend to visit or live in Brazil.
A Visit Visa (VIVIS) will be applied for those who come to Brazil for tourism, business, transit, and for the performance of audit and consulting activities for up to 90 days. The law prohibits any remunerated activity under this type of visa; however, the foreigner visitor may receive daily allowances for travel expenses.
Official, diplomatic, and courtesy visas are generally applicable for foreign government representatives or private employees who travel to Brazil for an official visit, under a temporary or permanent nature.
### Residence authorisation
The residence authorisation may be granted to foreigners while in Brazil depending on the circumstance. Citizens from countries located on the border of Brazil, as well as those who are from countries that are part of the Mercosul agreement, have a more expedited application process.
The aforementioned legislation also affects the current individual tax residence rules with respect to foreign individuals in Brazil, which will need to be duly updated by the Brazilian IRS to take into account the new types of visas and new rules for residence authorisation.
## Brazilian Central Bank (BACEN) Reporting Requirement
In July 2020, the BACEN, under Normative Resolution nº. 4,841, raised the total value of assets abroad that requires mandatory annual filing of the Brazilian Central Bank Central Bank Reporting (CBE) from 100,000 to 1 million United States dollars (USD).
According to the new rule, the CBE must be filed by any individual, tax resident in Brazil, who, on 31 December, had total assets equal to or greater than USD 1 million or equivalent in other currencies.
In case of not complying with such obligation, the taxpayer will be assessed to pay penalties.
The deadline for the delivery of such reporting requirements is 5 April, according to the rules annually issued by the BACEN.
In addition, the fiscal residents who hold foreign-held assets and rights where the value is equal to or more than USD 100 million as of 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September of each year must file the Brazilian Central Bank Report on a quarterly basis.
The non-compliance with the Brazilian Central Bank obligations may subject the individual to penalties that may reach up to BRL 250,000.
## Departure from Brazil
A resident taxpayer of Brazil who leaves the country permanently or becomes a non-tax resident after 12 months outside of the country (due to a temporary departure) must file a Communication of Definitive Departure to the Brazilian tax authorities.
The deadline for filing a Communication of Definitive Departure from Brazil is up to the last business day of February of the calendar year subsequent to the year of departure from Brazil on a permanent or temporary basis, as follows:
Additionally, a resident taxpayer must file a Definitive Departure Income Tax Return, which will comprise the period of fiscal residency in Brazil. The filing deadline of a Definitive Departure Tax Return is the last business day of April of the following calendar year. At that time, the individual must also file any annual Brazilian income tax returns due and not yet filed as well as request for an issuance of a Tax Clearance Certificate before the tax authorities.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Employment income
Taxable compensation includes everything that is either directly or indirectly connected with the work and/or assignment remuneration package, including salary, premiums, bonuses, allowances of any kind, tax reimbursements, club dues, and company-owned cars.
## Equity compensation
The income tax on stock options is due by individual residents in Brazil on the positive spread between the grant price and the fair market value at the time of exercise as well as upon the sale of the shares, where the sale results in a capital gain. Further implications must be observed in case the costs are recharged to the Brazilian entity.
## Business income
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from Brazilian companies, relating to profits derived from 1996 onwards, is tax exempt. Dividend income received from investments made abroad, however, is subject to monthly income tax payments.
## Interest income
Interest income received from Brazilian investments is subject to income tax withholding at source. The tax rate ranges from 15% to 22.5%, depending on the term of the investment. Interest income received from investments made abroad is subject to tax calculations on a monthly basis.
## Exempt income
Among other items, the following are exempt from any income tax:

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
First of all, it is important to emphasise that the ‘New Migration Law’ (Law 13,445 issued in May 2017) has formally revoked the ‘Foreigner Statute Law’ (Law 6.815/1980) and created new types and characteristics for allowable visas, extended the coverage conditions for the temporary visa, and introduced a new authorisation for residence.
The implementation of the new changes introduced by the 'New Migration Law' will depend on the issuance of regulations by the local authorities, specifically with respect to the procedures for visa issuances, as well as impact the current individual tax residence rules with respect to foreign individuals in Brazil.
Notwithstanding the above, until the new regulation is issued by the Brazilian authorities, the following individuals are considered residents for Brazilian income tax purposes:
The following individuals are considered non-residents for Brazilian income tax purposes:
