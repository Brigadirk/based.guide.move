## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Egyptian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) should be applied to inventory valuation, and all methods that are acceptable by Egyptian GAAP can be used. The methods acceptable are almost the same as those acceptable under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
## Capital gains
The law defines capital gains as the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair market value/selling price of the share. However, for listed shares acquired before 1 July 2014 and sold after that date, the capital gain will be calculated as the difference between either the acquisition price or the closing price on 30 June 2014 (whichever is higher) and the selling price.
### CGT treatment applicable to resident companies
### Capital gains tax treatment applicable to non-resident companies
### Capital losses
A capital loss can be offset against a capital gain arising during the same tax year, provided that they both arise from the sale of shares (i.e. gain and loss of listed shares are in a separate pool from the gain and loss of unlisted shares, so the loss from the sale of listed shares can only be offset against the gain from the listed shares and cannot be offset from the gain of unlisted ones). Excess capital losses that are not utilised during a tax year can be carried forward for a period of three years and should be offset against capital gains from the sale of shares.
### Law No. 30 updates: CGT additional incentives
Shares offering (IPO)/additional share tranches incentives:
EGX trading incentives:
## Dividend income
### Dividend income treatment applicable to resident companies
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to resident corporate shareholders. The 10% WHT will be reduced to 5% if the dividends are paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX.
Dividends received by resident companies from other resident companies should not be added to taxable income, provided that the related/associated costs are not deductible from the recipient companies' taxable profit (only 10% of the dividends received should be added to the taxable pool subject to CIT at the rate of 22.5%), provided that the company receiving the dividends holds more than 25% of the shares or the voting rights of the subsidiary company and holds or is committed to hold those shares for at least two years.
### Dividend income treatment applicable to non-resident companies
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to non-resident corporate shareholders. The 10% WHT will be reduced to 5% if the dividends are paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX.
Participation exemption
90% of the dividends distributed by a non-resident corporate shareholder to a resident one will be exempt from tax (i.e. only 10% of the amount of the dividends will be subject to tax). Such exemption can be benefited from if both of the following conditions are met:
### Permanent establishments (PEs)
A PE's profits should be deemed dividend payments, and thus subject to the above treatment, if they were not repatriated to the parent company within 60 days of the PE's financial year-end.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are not subject to tax in Egypt.
### Tax leakage on dividends distribution (as per the new amendments under Law No. 30).
For the purpose of reducing the tax leakage related to dividends distributed through a multi-layered structure in Egypt, the new amendments eliminate/reduce double taxation on dividends.
Certain eligibility conditions are provided for WHT deduction, including:
## Interest income
Interest expenses are deducted from interest income when calculating the interest income to be included in taxable income, provided certain conditions are met.
Generally, interest income is not taxed separately; it is considered as part of the company's income and taxed accordingly (i.e. at the 22.5% CIT rate).
## Rent/royalty income
Rent/royalty income are not taxed separately; they are considered as part of the company's income and taxed accordingly (i.e. at the 22.5% CIT rate).
## Foreign income
Income from any source, domestic or foreign, received by a corporation within Egypt is subject to CIT. The scope of tax covers the activities carried out inside and outside Egypt, which are administered or managed within Egypt.
There is no provision for deferring income earned abroad.

# Egypt
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Egypt, located in North Africa, is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Egypt is divided into 27 governorates, with Cairo as the capital. The official language of Egypt is Arabic, and the currency is the Egyptian pound (EGP).
The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's greatest civilisations. A unified kingdom arose about 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell in 341 B.C. The native dynasties were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the United Kingdom in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty in 1952.
The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honoured place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to affect the economy. Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley, where most economic activity takes place. Egypt's economy was highly centralised under previous rulers but has opened up considerably under recent leaders.
Following the January Revolution, Egypt has embarked on a political transition process. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) took power during the transition (interim) period. The parliamentary elections were held in November 2011, and presidential elections were finalised in June 2012. On 30 June 2012, Dr. Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as Egypt's President.
A number of rigorous changes have subsequently occurred in Egypt's political scene. President Mohamed Morsi was ousted from power, and the constitution was suspended after the demonstrations that took place in July 2013. Mr. Adly Mansour was appointed to act as Egypt's President during the transactional period until the presidential elections held in May 2014, which saw the election of Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who is now the Egyptian president.
The real GDP growth is at 3.7% in Q1 of the fiscal year 2023/24.
The Egyptian government introduced a package of tax reform amendments (effective 16 June 2023) affecting both multinational corporations on the international tax front and local corporations on the domestic front through the newly amended tax law to eliminate tax loopholes.
The international tax amendments are designed to keep up with the constant flow of international tax developments worldwide, which are aligned with the international best practises and the OECD BEPS package.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Payments of dividends, interest, royalties, and services by a domestic corporation to foreign or non-resident bodies are subject to WHT as follows.
## Dividends to non-residents
A flat rate of 5% WHT is to be imposed on dividends paid to non-resident corporate shareholders from shares listed on the EGX.
However, an applicable double tax treaty (DTT) between Egypt and the foreign country may result in the reduction/elimination of such tax rate.
## Interest to non-residents
The WHT exemption of interest on loans of more than three years has been abolished for private, public, and general public sectors; however, this exemption still applies for government, local government units, or other public juridical persons.
Loans existing before the newly amended tax law may continue enjoying the exemption of WHT as long as one interest payment was paid prior to the issuance date of the newly amended tax Law No. 30 on 16 June 2023.
## Royalties to non-residents
Royalty payments are subject to 20% WHT. However, an applicable DTT signed between Egypt and the foreign country may result in a reduction in this rate. *Please see below for the ministerial decree affecting the treatment of interest and royalty payments*.
## Service payments to non-residents
Service payments are subject to the 20% WHT. However, an applicable DTT signed between Egypt and the foreign country may result in the exemption of these payments if the services are performed abroad and not through PE in Egypt (based on each DTT).
For payments withheld on behalf of non-resident entities, tax shall be remitted to the tax authority the day following the withholding of the amount.
## Tax treaties
Egypt has concluded DTTs with over 50 countries, which could change the tax treatment of transactions carried out between Egyptian entities and residents of a treaty country.

Notes
1. Dividends paid out by a company resident of Egypt to an individual of the other contracting state shall not be taxed more than the maximum amount mentioned. 15% in all other cases.
2. Reduced rate of the gross amount of dividends is applied if the beneficial owner is a company that holds at least 25% of the company’s capital. Higher rate applies in all other cases.
3. In the absence of specific provisions, dividends may be taxed under the local law at 10% in case of unlisted shares, or a flat rate of 5% in case of listed shares.
4. Lower rate applies if the foreign company holds more than 25% of the capital in the company.
5. Lower rate applies if the beneficial owner is a company.
6. This rate is based on the new DTT that is signed and that came into effect in January 2022. This rate should apply under certain conditions mentioned by the DTT (e.g. owning at least 10% of the shares during 365 days including the date of dividends distributions).
7. The reduction in the rate does not apply if the recipient is engaged in a trade or business in the United States through a PE that is in the United States. However, if the income is not effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States by the recipient, the recipient will be considered as not having a PE in the United States to apply the reduced treaty rate to that item of income.
8. Reduced rate of the gross amount of dividends is applied if the beneficial owner is a company that holds at least 20% of the company’s capital. Higher rate applies in all other cases.
9. Reduced rate is applied if the beneficial owner is a company that holds at least 20% of the company’s capital for a duration of 365 days. Higher rate applies in all other cases.
10. Reduced rate in case the gross amount of such interest is related to a loan or debt claim for a period exceeding three years. Higher rate applies in all other cases.
11. Reduced rate is applied if the beneficial owner is a company that holds at least 10% of the company’s capital. Higher rate applies in all other cases.
It's worth noting that Qatar and Oman have both signed a DTT with Egypt, but theses treaties are not in force yet.
## Procedures for applying the WHT on payments to non-residents
Ministerial decree no. 771 for 2009 dictates that the reduced rate of WHT on interest or royalties provided by an applicable DTT should not be automatically applied. The rate of 20% (Egyptian tax rate) should be imposed upon deduction. However, under certain conditions, the foreign recipient of payments will be able to get a refund for the amount resulting from the variance between the normal rate of 20% and the reduced treaty rate.
Certain documents should be submitted to the tax authority along with the refund claim.
A special unit responsible for interest and royalty WHT refunds is tasked with reviewing each refund case and with issuing refund letters (subject to compliance with the requirements of the 2009 ministerial decree). A refund letter is required to be able to get a refund of excess WHT from the tax office to which the taxes were actually paid.
Please note that free zone entities are obligated to withhold tax when dealing with non-resident entities and shall remit the tax to the tax authority.
In 2015, amendments were made to certain articles of the executive regulations of the Egyptian Income Tax Law no. 91 of 2005, among which was amending the article that forms the basis of the ministerial decree no. 771, whereby some provisions of this article were abolished.
However, it is still a controversial issue whether (i) the decree is abolished and so the reduced rate of the DTT should apply automatically or (ii) the decree stands and the refund mechanism should apply. Practically, the ETA still applies the pay refund mechanism and the resident companies would still need to deduct the 20% WHT as applied by the domestic law and the non-resident party should request the refund from the ETA.
We are of the opinion that taxpayers must have the necessary documents available at all times, as the ETA, upon tax audit, may seek to ensure that the recipient of the income is the beneficial owner of it and is a tax resident of the relevant state, to approve benefiting from a relevant DTT's privileges.
## WHT on local payments
The rates of WHT applicable to local payments against local services and supplies in excess of EGP 300 have recently been updated as follows:
This type of WHT is considered as an advance payment of the CIT and should not represent an additional cost.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Social security contributions
### Employee contributions
The employee contribution percentage is 11% of the total social insurance salary.
The minimum and maximum limits are increased by 15% on 1 January of each year for a period of seven years, starting from 1 January 2021.
Accordingly, as of 1 January 2024, the minimum social insurance salary will be EGP 2,000; whereas, the maximum will be EGP 12,600.
| Year | Minimum wage (EGP) | Maximum wage (EGP) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2022 | 1,400 | 9,400 |
| 2023 | 1,700 | 10,900 |
| 2024 | 2,000 | 12,600 |
| 2025 | 2,300 | 14,500 |
| 2026 | 2,700 | 16,700 |
| 2027 | 3,200 | 19,300 |
### Employer contributions
The employer contribution percentage is 18.75% of the total social insurance salary.
In addition to the above, any managers/board of directors whose names are included in the commercial register of the company will be socially insured as employers and would be subject to social insurance at a flat rate of 21% of the total maximum wage (i.e. EGP 12,600 as of January 2024).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Egypt.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Egypt.
## Property taxes
The real estate tax law takes into consideration the different variables that can affect the value of a property, such as location, value of similar buildings, and the economic situation of the district in which the property is located. This is to be updated every five years.
Real estate tax is levied annually on all constructed real estate units. This covers land and building, excluding plant and machinery.
The real estate tax rate is 10% of the rental value, and the calculation of the rental value differs for residential units and non-residential units. Specific percentages of deductions are provided by the law to account for all the expenses incurred by the taxpayer, including maintenance costs.
The real estate's definition was recently amended to replace the original land spaces’ provision by the following: 'Actually exploited lands, whether independent or attached to buildings, fenced or not (as determined by the relevant executive regulations).'
A new article was recently introduced to the Real Estate Tax Law, allowing, by means of a decision from the Egyptian Cabinet, real estate tax exemption for the real estate actually exploited in the production and services activities stated by the Egyptian Cabinet, provided that the decision includes the below, for each production or service activity:
## Luxury and excise taxes
The sales tax law includes an excise tax on some products, such as the tobacco, alcohols, and medicines.
## Other non-income taxes
### Transfer tax
There is a 2.5% transfer tax on sales of built real estate or land prepared for building, assessed on the total disposal value of the property without any deductions except for villages under certain conditions mentioned in the law.
### Stamp tax
There are two distinct types of stamp tax, which are imposed on legal documents, deeds, banking transactions, company formation, insurance premiums, and other transactions, as follows:
A proportional stamp tax at the rate of 0.4% annually (i.e. 0.1% per quarter) is imposed on the bank's loan and shared by the bank and the client. This stamp tax is due on a quarterly basis on the beginning balance of each quarter of credit facilities and loans and advances provided by Egyptian banks or branches of foreign banks during the financial year in addition to the amounts utilised within this quarter.
Loans from other establishments are not subject to this tax.
In addition to the above, stamp duty is imposed on the total proceeds (i.e. value of the transaction) from buying or selling any kind of stocks/securities (with very limited exceptions for the T-bonds and T-bills), regardless of whether they are Egyptian or foreign, listed or non-listed, without deducting any costs, where buyer and seller should each apply the stamp duty on the total proceeds realised.
This type of stamp tax has also been among the changes announced by the Egyptian government, *as explained in the [Significant developments](egypt/corporate/significant-developments.html) section of the Corporate tax summary*.
Based on the current law, resident investors trading in or holding Egyptian shares/securities unlisted on the EGX and whether buyers or sellers should be subject to 0.05% stamp tax on the total proceeds realised without deducting any costs (for the transactions involving less than 33%). On the other hand, resident investors trading in listed shares should not be subject to stamp tax (for the transactions involving less than 33%). However, non-resident investors should pay 0.125% on the total value of the transaction for listed and unlisted shares (for transactions involving less than 33%).
However, for the transactions exceeding 33%, then the stamp tax rate should be 0.3% imposed on each of the buyer and the seller (i.e. the party exceeding the threshold) whether resident or non-resident for listed and unlisted shares.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Resident companies are taxed on worldwide income. Non-resident corporations and partnerships pay tax on income derived from their permanent establishments (PEs) in Egypt.
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate in Egypt is 22.5% on the net taxable profits of a company.
The above rate applies to all types of business activities except for oil exploration companies, whose profits are taxed at 40.55%. In addition, the profits of the Suez Canal Authority, the Egyptian Petroleum Authority, and the Central Bank of Egypt are taxable at a rate of 40%.
## Local income taxes
There are no governorate or local taxes on corporate income in Egypt.

## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year starting 1 January and closing on 31 December or any period of 12 months taken as a basis for income tax calculation.
## Tax returns
Individuals are required to submit an annual tax return to the tax authorities. The submission deadline for an individual is on or before 31 March following the end of the fiscal year to which the return relates.
Tax on employment income is withheld at source on a monthly basis. Employers are required to file quarterly tax statements in January, April, July, and October of each year.
Employers should submit an annual tax reconciliation to the tax authority on the first of January each year showing the annual salaries and wages of each employee accompanied with the unpaid payroll tax amounts.
## Payment of tax
Within the 15 days of the subsequent month following the date of payment.
## Tax audit process
The audit cycle proceeds as follows.
### Inspection
The tax authority inspects the company based on its documents and records in order to assess the total tax due on the company and determines the difference in tax due as per the company declaration and the tax authority assessment. The authority issues an assessment including the total tax due on the company. If the company objects the inspection result within 30 days of receiving the decision, the dispute is transferred to the Internal Committee.
### Internal Committee
The dispute is transferred to the Internal Committee to discuss the dispute points that arose from the inspection further to issue a modified assessment based on its opinion. If the company objects to the Internal Committee result, the dispute is transferred to the Appeal Committee to review the dispute points arising from the Internal Committee.
### Appeal Committee
The Appeal Committee’s decision is final and binding on the company and the tax department, unless a case is appealed by either of them at the court within 30 days of receiving the decision. Based on the fact that the total taxes due on the assessment as per the Appeal Committee are considered final, if they are not paid within the appropriate period, there will be penalties for the late payment.
### Court
If the decision of the Appeal Committee is not satisfactory for either party, the case will be transferred to the court system, which is considered the final stage of the disputes. Normally, the court will appoint an expert witness to investigate the case and prepare a report. The court process usually takes a long period of time.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the financial year of the taxpayer.
## Tax returns
The taxpayer is required to assess taxes due for every financial year and settle them with the tax return.
The CIT return is due within four months from the end of the financial year; consequently, if a company’s financial year ends 31 December, then the tax return has to be filed before the end of April of the following year.
Other returns, such as the VAT return, would be submitted on a monthly basis.
For the dividends, the party executing the transaction (Misr for Central Clearing, Depository and Registry or MCDR, broker, custodian, or any other party) should withhold the tax due and remit it to the ETA on form no. 44 (dividends’ payments). This form can be submitted either electronically (via the ETA’s website) or manually.
Under the current law, in regards to CGT, the party settling/executing the transaction (i.e. MCDR or the broker) is required to notify the ETA of the transaction no later than the fifth business day of the following month of the transaction. Furthermore, CGT should be remitted by the taxpayer to the ETA no later than the fifth business day of the following month of the transaction.
As for the CGT filing for non-residents, there are administrative/compliance procedures that should be followed in order to be able to apply the DTT exemptions (if any) based on the newly released CGT Guidelines.
### Electronic filing of CIT returns
The ETA has decided to apply the electronic filing (e-filing) of income tax returns starting from this financial year, hence the e-filing of tax returns by taxpayers on the ETA’s website has become mandatory.
Taxpayers will accordingly be required to register on the ETA’s website to create an account and to obtain a user name, password, and a specific code that will be provided to their tax adviser. Following the registration process, taxpayers shall prepare their annual income tax returns on the ETA’s website, and then have them reviewed/verified by their tax adviser. Prior to electronically submitting the return, both the taxpayer and the tax adviser will be required to sign-off on the income tax return.
Upon submission of the tax return, the taxpayer will be required to pay the tax due through one of the following methods:
## Payment of tax
Advance payments are deducted from taxes assessed per the tax return, and the balance is payable in a lump sum at the date of submitting the tax return.
The advance payment (i.e. WHT) is submitted on a quarterly basis.
### Penalties
Please note that taxpayers have the opportunity to reduce the penalty rates by 50% if they can reach an agreement with the ETA before referring the case to the Appeal Committee.
#### Unified Tax Procedures Law
The Egyptian government issued the Unified Tax Procedures Law, amending certain articles of the income tax law and mainly focusing on the filing procedures and imposing financial penalties.
The Law has stated a range of financial penalties for non-compliance with the tax laws as follows:
## Tax audit process
The audit cycle proceeds as follows:
### Inspection
The tax authority inspects the company based on its documents and records in order to assess the total tax due on the company and determines the difference in tax due as per the company declaration and the tax authority assessment. The authority issues an assessment including the total tax due on the company. If the company objects to the inspection result, the dispute is transferred to the Internal Committee.
### Internal Committee
The dispute is transferred to the Internal Committee to discuss the dispute points that arose from the inspection further to issue a modified assessment based on its opinion. If the company objects to the Internal Committee result, the dispute is transferred to the Appeal Committee to review the dispute points arising from the Internal Committee.
### Appeal Committee
The Appeal Committee’s decision is final and binding on the company and the tax department unless a case is appealed by either of them at the court within 30 days of receiving the decision. Based on the fact that the total taxes due on the assessment as per the Appeal Committee are considered final if they are not paid within the appropriate period, there will be penalties for the late payment.
### Court
If the decision of the Appeal Committee is not satisfactory for either party, the case will be transferred to the court system, which is considered the final stage of the disputes. Normally, the court will appoint an expert witness to investigate the case and prepare a report. The court process usually takes a long period of time.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years according to the Egyptian Income Tax Law and is extended to be six years in case of tax evasion.
## General anti-avoidance rule (GAAR)
A GAAR is applicable to arrangements entered into on or after 1 July 2014. The primary objective of the GAAR is to deter taxpayers from entering into abusive arrangements for the purpose of obtaining an abusive tax advantage. The law stipulates that the tax effect of any transaction whose main purpose, or one of the main purposes thereof, is tax avoidance shall not be reckoned with. In this case, the crucial factor when making tax assessments is the real economic substance of the transaction in question. The burden of proving that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of conducting a transaction has been to avoid taxation lies with the tax authority.

## Social security contributions
### Employee contributions
The employee contribution percentage is 11% of the total social insurance salary.
The minimum and maximum limits are increased by 15% on 1 January of each year for a period of seven years, starting from 1 January 2021.
Accordingly, as of 1 January 2024, the minimum social insurance salary will be EGP 2,000; whereas, the maximum will be EGP 12,600.
| Year | Minimum wage (EGP) | Maximum wage (EGP) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2022 | 1,400 | 9,400 |
| 2023 | 1,700 | 10,900 |
| 2024 | 2,000 | 12,600 |
| 2025 | 2,300 | 14,500 |
| 2026 | 2,700 | 16,700 |
| 2027 | 3,200 | 19,300 |
### Employer contributions
The employer contribution percentage is 18.75% of the total social insurance salary.
In addition to the above, any managers/board of directors whose names are included in the commercial register of the company will be socially insured as employers and would be subject to social insurance at a flat rate of 21% of the total maximum wage (i.e. EGP 12,600 as of January 2024).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Egypt.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Egypt.
## Property taxes
The real estate tax law takes into consideration the different variables that can affect the value of a property, such as location, value of similar buildings, and the economic situation of the district in which the property is located. This is to be updated every five years.
Real estate tax is levied annually on all constructed real estate units. This covers land and building, excluding plant and machinery.
The real estate tax rate is 10% of the rental value, and the calculation of the rental value differs for residential units and non-residential units. Specific percentages of deductions are provided by the law to account for all the expenses incurred by the taxpayer, including maintenance costs.
The real estate's definition was recently amended to replace the original land spaces’ provision by the following: 'Actually exploited lands, whether independent or attached to buildings, fenced or not (as determined by the relevant executive regulations).'
A new article was recently introduced to the Real Estate Tax Law, allowing, by means of a decision from the Egyptian Cabinet, real estate tax exemption for the real estate actually exploited in the production and services activities stated by the Egyptian Cabinet, provided that the decision includes the below, for each production or service activity:
## Luxury and excise taxes
The sales tax law includes an excise tax on some products, such as the tobacco, alcohols, and medicines.
## Other non-income taxes
### Transfer tax
There is a 2.5% transfer tax on sales of built real estate or land prepared for building, assessed on the total disposal value of the property without any deductions except for villages under certain conditions mentioned in the law.
### Stamp tax
There are two distinct types of stamp tax, which are imposed on legal documents, deeds, banking transactions, company formation, insurance premiums, and other transactions, as follows:
A proportional stamp tax at the rate of 0.4% annually (i.e. 0.1% per quarter) is imposed on the bank's loan and shared by the bank and the client. This stamp tax is due on a quarterly basis on the beginning balance of each quarter of credit facilities and loans and advances provided by Egyptian banks or branches of foreign banks during the financial year in addition to the amounts utilised within this quarter.
Loans from other establishments are not subject to this tax.
In addition to the above, stamp duty is imposed on the total proceeds (i.e. value of the transaction) from buying or selling any kind of stocks/securities (with very limited exceptions for the T-bonds and T-bills), regardless of whether they are Egyptian or foreign, listed or non-listed, without deducting any costs, where buyer and seller should each apply the stamp duty on the total proceeds realised.
This type of stamp tax has also been among the changes announced by the Egyptian government, *as explained in the [Significant developments](egypt/corporate/significant-developments.html) section of the Corporate tax summary*.
Based on the current law, resident investors trading in or holding Egyptian shares/securities unlisted on the EGX and whether buyers or sellers should be subject to 0.05% stamp tax on the total proceeds realised without deducting any costs (for the transactions involving less than 33%). On the other hand, resident investors trading in listed shares should not be subject to stamp tax (for the transactions involving less than 33%). However, non-resident investors should pay 0.125% on the total value of the transaction for listed and unlisted shares (for transactions involving less than 33%).
However, for the transactions exceeding 33%, then the stamp tax rate should be 0.3% imposed on each of the buyer and the seller (i.e. the party exceeding the threshold) whether resident or non-resident for listed and unlisted shares.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 14% as of the financial year 2017/18 (i.e. as of 1 July 2017; previously 13%). The standard rate is applicable to all goods and services; however, the reduced VAT rate of 5% is applied to the machinery and equipment that are necessary for producing goods or providing services. As per the amended VAT Law No. 3 for the year 2022, the 5% reduced rate of the machinery and equipment that was used for the purpose of industrial production activities is suspended for one year from the importation date and might be extended for a further one year. Then, such machinery and equipment may be exempt from VAT in case it has been proved that they are only used for industrial production activities; otherwise, the due VAT should be paid alongside the due additional tax.
It's important to note that the exported goods and services are to be subject to 0% VAT.
The VAT law exempts a number of basic goods and services that affect low-income earners (in addition to other exemptions listed within the law).
Further, the VAT law includes a reverse-charge mechanism, whereby transactions involving non-residents providing services/royalties to Egyptian resident entities are subject to VAT in Egypt.
Also based on the newly issued updates, VAT at the rate of 14% is imposed on the advertisements services that were exempted before.
It’s worth noting that the new amendments to VAT issued by virtue of Law No. 3 include new concepts to VAT, such as the simplified vendor registration system (SVRS), which every non-resident and unregistered person who does not perform through a PE in Egypt to sell a good or provide services is required to apply for.
Also, for the reverse-charge concept, it’s critical to mention that the physical representative concept is no longer required based on the new amendments clarifying the reverse-charge concept.
### Simplified Vendor Registration System (SVRS)
This SVRS should be enforced within six months for services and within two years for commodities from the effective date of the law.
According to the aforementioned law, every non-resident and an unregistered person who does not practise an activity through a PE in Egypt and sells goods or provides taxable services to a person who is not registered inside the country is required to apply for registration under the SVRS as specified by the executive regulations.
The non-resident and unregistered person or representative shall fill and submit the relevant application through the tax authority’s portal.
### Electronic filing of VAT returns
The Egyptian tax authority (ETA) has introduced a new e-filing system for the submission of the VAT returns; consequently, taxpayers will be required to submit their VAT returns (i.e. monthly VAT and/or schedule returns) electronically through the ETA’s website, starting from January 2019. Accordingly, the manual filing of VAT returns will not be accepted as of the mentioned date.
The account created by taxpayers for the e-filing of CIT returns shall be used to access the ETA’s website. Such an account will provide taxpayers access for the e-filing of all relevant taxes, including VAT. Taxpayers will be required to register on the ETA’s website to create an online account for the e-filing procedures. Upon filing the online VAT return, taxpayers should pay the VAT amount due through regular bank transfers and then enter the details of the payment on the ETA’s website to finalise the VAT e-filing process.
### E-invoicing
As per the unified tax law article no. 35, taxpayers are required to use the e-invoicing system with regard to all the performed transactions whether by issuing an e-invoice/e-receipt.
As per the Ministry of Finance decree no. 188 on 26 March 2020, taxpayers are required to issue their invoices electronically as per the technical and legal requirements that were issued by the head of the ETA.
In November 2020, the ETA started applying the e-invoicing system gradually in phases. The decision includes the steps and conditions needed to be followed by the taxpayers. The decree also mentioned that the non-selected companies can voluntarily join the phase in order to apply the new e-invoicing system, provided that the required conditions and steps declared in the decision are fulfilled. Recently, it was announced that all Egyptian entities should be applying the e-invoicing system before the end of financial year 2022.
### VAT on digital and other remote services provided by non-residents
The Ministry of Finance has recently issued Decree no. 160 of 2023 that includes guidance for the VAT on digital and other remote services provided by non-residents. Under the newly issued decree, non-resident entities that provide services directly to consumers (B2C) are required to follow the steps below:
For services provided to other businesses (B2B), the following rules apply:
## Customs duties
The liability for customs duty rests with the person who is importing the goods from abroad.
Customs duties are imposed on imported goods at rates that vary according to official categories. Average rates of duties range between 0% and 60% of the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value.
Higher rates (up to 135%) are applied for passenger cars, nonessential and luxury consumer goods, and alcoholic beverages.
With regard to the importation of machines and equipment to be used for industrial purposes, the rate of customs duty that applies in this case ranges from 0% to 5% depending on the exact type of the good (determined according to its customs code). However, it is worth noting that trucks and heavy equipment are generally subject to customs duty between the rates of 10% and 20%.
In Egypt, the government is flexible with importing second-hand equipment, with an aim to encourage foreign investment.
VAT applies on such imported products at 14% of the customs/import duty paid (the VAT base will be based upon the invoice value CIF, the customs duty, and other taxes).
A contractor who intends to re-export plants and equipment after expiration of a contract may import the plant and equipment into Egypt free of customs duties if certain requirements were met.
Under all circumstances, a fee at a rate of 2% monthly and up to 20% annually of the amount of customs duty due is imposed for each year or partial year the plant or equipment remains in Egypt before re-export. Note that it is effective for a period of one year and may be renewed after the approval of the Customs Authority.
Also, customs tax amounting to 1% of the stipulated customs tax on the date of the temporary release shall be collected for every month or part thereof with a maximum of 10% annually for equipment, new and renewable energy components, and their spare parts.
## Excise taxes
Under the Egyptian VAT Law No. 67 for the year 2016, an excise tax was introduced as special tax rates imposed on certain products and services.
The excise tax (which is also called schedule tax or table tax) should be imposed only once on the listed products and services (e.g. professional services, construction services, processed potatoes), and it should only be imposed once more if there was a change in the product status. The excise tax is solely applied on specific listed items while it could be applicable in addition to the normal 14% VAT on some other items (e.g. air conditioners).
The excise tax should not be considered as a recoverable input tax, nor should it be deducted against incurred input VAT, with very limited exceptions.
## Real estate taxes
The Real Estate Tax Law takes into consideration the different variables that can affect the value of a property, such as location, value of similar buildings, and the economic situation of the district in which the property is located. This is to be updated every five years (most recently in August 2014).
Real estate tax is levied annually on all constructed real estate units, with the exemption of schools, orphanages, charitable organisations, and private residences with a market value of less than 2 million Egyptian pounds (EGP). This tax covers land and buildings, excluding plant and machinery.
The real estate tax rate is 10% of the rental value, and the calculation of the rental value differs for residential units and non-residential units. Specific percentages of deductions are provided by the law to account for all the expenses incurred by the taxpayer, including maintenance costs.
The real estate's definition was recently amended to replace the original land spaces’ provision by the following: 'Actually exploited lands, whether independent or attached to buildings, fenced or not (as determined by the relevant executive regulations).'
In addition, a new article was recently introduced to the Real Estate Tax Law, allowing by means of a decision from the Egyptian Cabinet, real estate tax exemption for the real estate actually exploited in the production and services activities stated by the Egyptian Cabinet, provided that the decision includes the below, for each production or service activity:
## Stamp tax
There are two distinct types of stamp tax, which are imposed on legal documents, deeds, banking transactions, company formation, insurance premiums, and other transactions, as follows:
An annual proportional stamp tax at the rate of 0.4%, shared by the bank and the client, is imposed on a bank's loans. This stamp tax is due on a quarterly basis on the beginning balance of each quarter of credit facilities and loans and advances provided by Egyptian banks or branches of foreign banks during the financial year in addition to the amounts utilised within the quarter.
Loans from other establishments are not subject to this tax.
With the introduction of Law No. 30, minor changes took place with regards to the Stamp Tax Law No. 111 for 1981, namely, the following:
### Stamp tax on the disposal of financial securities
Stamp duty is enacted on the disposal of shares as per the publication number 24 in the official gazette published on 19 June 2017. As per the publication, such stamp duty is imposed on the total proceeds (i.e. value of the transaction) from buying or selling any kind of stocks/securities (with very limited exceptions for the T-bills and T-bonds), regardless of whether they are Egyptian or foreign, listed or non-listed, without deducting any costs, where buyer and seller should each apply the stamp duty on the total proceeds realised.
This type of stamp tax has also been among the changes announced by the Egyptian government, *as explained in the [Significant developments](egypt/corporate/significant-developments.html) section*.
Based on the law, resident investors trading in or holding Egyptian shares/securities unlisted on the EGX and whether buyers or sellers should be subject to 0.05% stamp tax on the total proceeds realised without deducting any costs (for the transactions involving less than 33% of a company's shares). On the other hand, resident investors trading in or holding Egyptian shares/securities listed on the EGX are exempt from the stamp tax for the transactions involving less than 33% of a company's shares (the 0.05% that used to apply on listed shares has been abolished starting 1 January 2022).
On the other hand, non-resident investors trading in or holding Egyptian shares/securities (whether listed or unlisted on the EGX and whether buyers or sellers) should be subject to 0.125% stamp tax on the total proceeds realised without deducting any costs (for the transactions involving less than 33% of a company's shares).
On the other hand, in case any of the below-mentioned conditions are met, then the rate of the stamp duty to be imposed in such case should be 0.3%:
In both cases above, the buyer and seller (i.e. the party exceeding the threshold) should each pay the 0.3% stamp duty on the gross transaction value without deducting any costs.
## Payroll taxes
There is no payroll tax other than the employer’s social insurance contribution (*see below*).
## Social insurance (employer’s contribution)
The social insurance contribution of the employer is 18.75% of the total social insurance salary.
## Comprehensive health insurance system contributions
Egypt is embarking on implementing a new comprehensive health insurance system, starting from 2019. The law behind the new health insurance system entered into force on the 12 July 2018. This new system will be implemented within a 15-year period and over six phases. Each phase will comprise five governorates at a time, whereby Cairo and Giza governorates, among others, will be in the final phase of implementation. The new health insurance system will be financed through several sources and among them are the following:
Individuals who wish to benefit from the new health insurance system will be required to pay a subscription fee, depending on the category they fall in, as detailed below:
The above-mentioned subscription fees will only be paid when the new health insurance system is applied in the relevant governorate (e.g. no fees should be paid by Cairo citizens/individuals until the last phase of implementation of the system). The party collecting such subscription fees will be required to submit them within 30 days from the date of collection.
It is important to mention that any non-compliance with the new health insurance system may result in financial or imprisonment penalties.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Law No. 30
Generally, the new Law No. 30 is designed with the aim of boosting the economy and streamlining the taxation of various items of income.
These modifications will be effective starting 16 June 2023 and are expected to be followed by the executive regulations from the Ministry of Finance in the coming months.
## Post COVID-19 updates
Post the COVID-19 pandemic, updates/changes have been announced by the Egyptian government to several articles in the Egyptian income tax law derived with the intention to stimulate the economy.
Such changes mainly cover the withholding tax (WHT) imposed on the dividend distributions made by an Egyptian company, capital gains tax (CGT) realised upon disposing of Egyptian listed shares on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX), along with the stamp tax imposed, as explained below.
In addition, a decree has been published abolishing the 20% stamp tax that has been imposed on advertisements and adding a 14% value-added tax (VAT) instead.
## E-invoicing system in Egypt
As part of the digital transformation for the tax government practice in Egypt and following the introduction of the e-filling mechanism, the Ministry of Finance has released Decree no. 188 of 2020 for introducing the new e-invoicing system.
In July 2021, Ministerial Decree no. 1206 of 2021 was issued obligating all governmental bodies not to accept any paper invoices from any of their suppliers as of 1 October 2021. Therefore, any company dealing with any governmental body must apply the e-invoicing system before that date.
As of 1 April 2023, paper invoices will not be considered in proving costs or expenses when submitting tax returns for income tax, as well as when deducting or refunding VAT, and only electronic invoices will be considered.
Electronic invoices are to be applicable starting July 2023, and electronic receipts starting January 2025.
## Dividends distributed by a listed Egyptian company
## Dividends distributed by a non-listed Egyptian company
## Dividends distributed between resident entities
## CGT imposed on the gains realised from the disposal of shares/securities listed on the EGX
If the shares were offered on the EGX for the first time (IPO):
In case additional tranches were offered after the issuance date of the newly amended tax law (i.e. 15 June 2023), 25% of the realised capital gains shall not be subject to tax upon fulfilment of certain conditions.
EGX trading incentives:
## Stamp tax imposed on the proceeds realised upon disposing of shares/securities listed on the EGX
## Stamp tax imposed on the proceeds realised upon disposing of unlisted shares/securities
## Returns received from funds
The newly amended tax law treatment of the gains/returns received from eligible funds by juridical persons will be subject to a flat tax rate as follows:
The relevant investment cost related to the aforementioned gains and returns will be considered non-deductible expenses.
The executive regulations of this law shall determine the calculation methodology of the relevant costs.
This is to be applicable for financial years (FYs) ending after 15 June 2023.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Foreign corporations and partnerships are classified as residents of Egypt if they meet one of the following conditions:
The executive regulations of the law indicate that Egypt is considered as the effective place of management if the entity meets any two of the following conditions:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The PE concept is defined in the Income Tax Law as follows:
The new amendments as per Law No. 30 have expanded the ‘permanent establishment’ definition through the introduction of a threshold for the PE period and the concept of Service PE and Insurance PE, as well as certain Agency PE updates in alignment with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 7.
A foreign company that is deemed to have a PE risk, according to the Egyptian Companies Law, should incorporate a legal vehicle in Egypt.
There are several legal forms existing under the Egyptian Companies Law from which a foreign company can choose to incorporate, and these are a joint-stock company, limited liability company, branch, or representative office.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
In order for expenses to be acceptable for tax deduction, such expenses must be:
## Depreciation and amortisation
The tax law set the depreciation and amortisation rates for tax purposes to the following:
### Accelerated depreciation
A company may have the option to deduct 30% accelerated depreciation from the value of the machines and equipment used in industries during the first fiscal year of their employment. This should be done by submitting a request to the tax authority prior to deducting the 30% accelerated depreciation.
## Goodwill
According to Article 25 of the Egyptian Income Tax Law, goodwill is amortised at the rate of 10% using the straight-line method.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are tax deductible, and the whole amount can be amortised for the first year.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible for tax purposes after offsetting any tax-exempt interest income.
Interest expense deductions are only allowed if the following conditions are fully met:
## Bad debt
According to Article 28 of the Egyptian Income Tax Law, deduction of bad debts shall be allowed, subject to submitting a report from the external auditor indicating the fulfilment of the following conditions:
## Charitable contributions
Donations to the government are tax deductible. Donations to Egyptian charities are also deductible, but only up to 10% of taxable income.
## Fines and penalties
Financial fines and penalties paid by the taxpayer because they or one of their subordinates has committed a deliberate felony or misdemeanour are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income tax payable according to the Income Tax Law is not deductible.
## Other significant items
The following other items are not deductible:
## Net operating losses
A company may carry losses forward for a period not to exceed five years. Nevertheless, if a change occurs in the ownership of its capital exceeding 50% of the shares, stocks, or the voting rights, if the company is either a joint-stock company or a company limited by shares whose shares are not listed on the Egyptian Stock of Exchange, and if the company changes its activity, the company cannot carry the losses forward.
In general, companies cannot carry losses back, except for contracting companies (i.e. in case of long-term projects), which are allowed a loss carryback for an unlimited period of time (to the extent of the duration of the contract).
## Payments to head office
A branch may deduct head-office charges of up to 10% of its taxable income. Moreover, the branch or subsidiary should withhold taxes before the payment of interest, royalties, and service fees to non-resident foreign corporations or affiliates.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
The Egyptian tax law treats every company in a group of companies as a separate legal entity. Thus, affiliated companies or subsidiaries cannot shift the profits/losses within the group.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing rules follow the arm’s-length principle, specifying that any transaction between related parties should be at arm’s length (i.e. market value).
The law states that the Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA) may adjust the pricing of transactions between related parties if the transaction involves elements that would not be included in transactions between non-related parties, and whose purpose is to shift the tax burden to tax exempt or non-taxable entities. Where this is the case, the tax authorities may determine the taxable profit on the basis of the neutral price.
On 29 November 2010, the ETA launched the Egyptian Transfer Pricing Guidelines (‘EGTP Guidelines’). The EGTP Guidelines are being issued as a series of parts, the first part of which was issued in final version to the public and provides guidance on the arm’s-length principle, how to establish comparability, choosing the most appropriate transfer pricing method(s), and documentation requirements.
The Egyptian Minister of Finance has issued a Ministerial Decree published in the official Gazette on 22 May 2018, amending some provisions of the executive regulations of the income tax law that relate to the Egyptian regulations. Such amendments were a prelude to the final EGTP Guidelines, which were released on 23 October 2018.
The headline changes presented in the updated EGTP Guidelines are the three-tiered approach to TP documentation and the introduction of the Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) programme.
### The three-tiered approach
The updated EGTP Guidelines introduced the three-tiered approach to TP documentation and include the mandatory filing of namely, the master file, local file, and the country-by-country (CbC) report. Prior to these updates, taxpayers were not required to submit TP documentation, but from now on, the filing of TP documentation would be mandatory on an annual basis.
The CbC report facilitates the reporting process for multinational enterprises (MNEs). The CbC report provides a template for MNEs to report annually and for each jurisdiction the necessary information relating to the MNEs' global allocation of income, taxes paid, and other indicators regarding the economic activity in order to assess the overall related-party transactions taking place between affiliated enterprises within the same group. The thresholds for CbC report filing are as follows:
### Filing deadlines
The master file should be prepared in accordance to the taxpayer group's ultimate parent's tax return filing date and made available to the ETA in 'due course'. In case the ultimate parent is not required to file a tax return in its country, then the master file should be submitted to the ETA along with the local file.
The entity-by-entity local files must be submitted to the ETA within two months following the date of filing the tax return.
The CbC report should generally be submitted one year following the close of the relevant financial year that it covers, and the CbC report notifications are due before the end of the fiscal year to which the CbC report relates.
Note that free zone entities are required to prepare and submit the CbC report notifications.
### Advance Pricing Arrangements (APAs)
The APA system provides Egyptian taxpayers with the benefit of agreeing in advance with the ETA on the methods to be followed by the taxpayer to determine arm's-length arrangements acceptable for tax purposes when it comes to related-party transactions.
Such APA programme should deliver benefits to the taxpayers such as certainty on TP methods, tax outcomes, increased transparency and reduced risks of audits, price adjustments, and penalties.
The APA programme is introduced for the first time in Egypt and, accordingly, the ETA decided to restrict its application to the unilateral APA(s) at this stage and to introduce the bilateral and multilateral APA(s) in the future. In addition, the option to apply for the APA is open to all the taxpayers, subject to the provisions of the law including PEs.
The guidance on the APA programme is contained within a new part two of the EGTP Guidelines, which describes the mechanisms, procedures, and implementation of the programme in Egypt. The process of applying for and concluding the unilateral APA may take between three to six months and this may vary according to the case at hand.
### Acceptable TP methods as per the updated EGTP Guidelines
As per the updated EGTP Guidelines, the acceptable methods are listed as follows:
Following the updated Guidelines, the hierarchy is no longer applicable in applying TP methods. In addition, the updated EGTP Guidelines allow taxpayers to use other methods in the event that none of the listed methods can be applied on the considered transactions.
However, the ETA expects the taxpayers to first maintain and prepare sufficient documentation to explain the reason why those methods cannot be reliably applied on the transaction. Moreover, the updated EGTP Guidelines include a statement illustrating that the ETA considers the 'Global Formulary apportionment' as the least reliable method to be used in determining the arm's-length price of the controlled transaction. In any case, the comparability analysis should be performed to select the appropriate transfer pricing method in accordance with the arm's-length principle.
### Unified Tax Procedures Law
On 19 October 2020, the Egyptian government issued the Unified Tax Procedures Law No. 206 of 2020. Under the Law, taxpayers engaged in commercial or financial related-party transactions of EGP 15 million or more should prepare and submit the master and local file. *For the CbC report threshold, please refer to the above section*.
The law has introduced a financial penalty of EGP 3,000 up to EGP 50,000 applicable in case of non-compliance with the transfer pricing three-tier filing requirements, such penalty could be doubled or tripled in case of recurrence.
Taxpayers who fail to disclose their related-party transactions (in the relevant section of the corporate tax return) will be subject to a penalty of 1% imposed on the total value of related-party transactions in the respective year.
In addition to the aforementioned penalty on non-disclosure, non-submission of the master file will be subject to 3%, non-submission of the local file will be subject to 3%, and non-submission of the CbC report and CbC report notifications will be subject to 2% of the total related-party transactions.
The law also depicted that the total amount of penalties that could be imposed on a taxpayer shall not exceed / is capped at 3% of the total value of the related-party transactions in case there are multiple non-submissions.
## Thin capitalisation
The Egyptian thin capitalisation rule provided by the Egyptian Income Tax Law dictates that the debt-to-equity ratio is currently 4:1 and will gradually change to reach 2:1 as follows:
Accordingly, the Law disallows the deductibility of debit interests of Egyptian companies on loans and advances if such loans and advances are in excess of fourfold the equity average (which is calculated according to the financial statements prepared pursuant to the Egyptian accounting standards). In other words, the excess amount of interest would not be deducted.
Debt includes loans and advances, including bonds and any form of financing by debts, even if through securities with fixed/variable interest.
With respect to the debit interest, it includes all amounts paid by a taxpayer in return for the loans, advances of any kind obtained, bonds, and bills.
For determining the equity, the following items represent the basis for the calculation: the paid-up capital in addition to all reserves and retained earnings reduced by retained losses. In addition, revaluation gains should be excluded from the equation, in case they were not subject to tax. In case of retained or carryforward losses, they must be used to reduce retained earnings and reserves solely; the percentage is calculated on the basis of total loans and advances in proportion to the remaining equity amount, after deducting the retained losses with a minimum of the paid-up capital (in other words, they should be deducted from the retained earnings and reserves, where in case of a net loss balance, debt should be compared to the paid-up capital).
For the purpose of calculating the debt-to-equity ratio, average debt and equity balances are used.
It’s worth noting that the following types of loans should be excluded from the above calculation:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Egypt currently does not define specific rules for CFCs; however, in an effort to exert similar CFC provisions, investments are evaluated according to the Egyptian Accounting Standards and the equity rights method, where the profits generating from the disposal of such investments are determined on the basis of the difference between the cost of investment acquisition and its sale value.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Branches of foreign corporations operating in Egypt receive tax treatment identical to that of corporate entities for the results of their activities in Egypt.
A branch, but not a subsidiary, may deduct a 'head office charge' of an amount of up to 10% of its taxable income.
According to law no. 53 of 2014, which imposed WHT on dividend payments, a PE's profits will be deemed dividend payments (and thus subject to 10% WHT according to law no. 199 of 2020, such rate is updated from the previous 5% WHT) if not repatriated within 60 days of the following financial year-end.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Egypt offers no specific tax incentives unless a company is a free zone entity, which is considered tax exempt for the permitted and licensed activities, or an entity that is established under the special economic zones law.
Certain incentives may be provided under the investment law for certain and specific types of activities.
## Foreign tax credit
The foreign tax paid by a resident company on its profits earned abroad is deductible from the tax payable in Egypt; however, losses incurred abroad are not deductible.

## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Egypt signed an inclusive framework agreement with the OECD, to become a member to the BEPS Project. Accordingly, Egypt has signed the multilateral instrument (MLI) agreement with the BEPS member countries, which is currently enforced. Such agreement requires the implementation of the four minimum standards action points of the BEPS Project in order to cope with the dramatic changes being introduced to the tax environment. The four minimum standard actions address the following:
As mentioned earlier, Egypt signed the MLI on 7 June 2017 and opted to apply the principal purpose test (PPT) to its covered tax agreements. As the MLI has been ratified in March 2021, this entails that any covered tax agreement under Egypt's MLI has automatically changed to reflect the MLI provisions.
In turn, any DTT that is covered under Egypt's MLI should be modified to include a PPT denying treaty benefits where the principal purpose of a structure is to secure a tax advantage.
In effect to the ratification of the MLI and once it becomes integrated in the Egyptian income tax law provisions, the ETA would most likely impose stricter substance requirements on the claimants of DTTs’ benefits in order to apply the relevant DTT’s benefits. There is no guidance yet on what the ETA would require as a proof of sufficient substance. In any case, it is recommended to have a solid business and economic substance in the country where the DTT benefit claimant is resident in order to mitigate the risk of denying the DTT benefits in Egypt.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Law No. 44 of 2014, followed by Law No. 53 of 2014, ('the new laws') were enacted in June 2014 to amend some of the provisions of the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendments of the Law include the following:
Ministerial Decree No. 172 for the year 2015 ('the new executive regulations') was enacted in April 2015 to amend some of the provisions of the executive regulations of the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendment of the new executive regulations includes the worldwide taxation of individuals.
The Law introduced the new concept that Egypt should be the individual's centre of commercial or industrial activities in order for foreign-source income to be subject to Egyptian individual income tax.
The executive regulations defined the centre of commercial or industrial activities to be the seat where the individual's decisions necessary for conducting one's activities take place and where one's vital interests are located.
In August 2015, a new law was introduced (Law No. 96 of 2015) that introduced some amendments to the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendments of the law include the following:
In June 2023, additional amendments were introduced (Law No. 30 of 2023) to the Egyptian Income Tax Law (No. 91 of 2005). The major amendments of the law include the following:
Furthermore, the new amendments have introduced some changes to the payroll tax calculation for employees receiving salary from a non-principal employer, as follows:
In addition to the above, changes have taken place with regard to the withholding tax (WHT) on dividends made by Egyptian companies to resident and non-resident individuals. *Please refer to the [Income determination](income-determination.html) section for more details*.

## Specific expatriate items and tax concessions
Foreign executives and technicians are taxed only on income from Egyptian sources and income received against work provided for Egypt (regardless of the source of payment) and not on their worldwide income (as long as Egypt is not the centre of their commercial or industrial activity). In addition, expatriates are subject to Egyptian social security contributions as of 2020.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Individual income tax is imposed on the total net income of the resident individuals for income earned in Egypt, as well as the income earned outside Egypt for resident individuals whose centre of commercial, industrial, or professional activities is in Egypt. Also, tax is imposed on the income of non-resident individuals for their income earned for work provided in Egypt, regardless of the source of payment, as well as the income earned from an Egyptian source.
## Employment income
Reimbursement for expenses of spouses and dependants is considered taxable income. In addition, school tuition fees, long-term living expenses, and overseas and hardship allowances are taxable.
The current tax law exempts severance pay, pension payments after the fulfilment of specific conditions, and employees’ profit share.
The following benefits are tax exempted, provided that the benefits are in kind and given for all employees. The benefits are:
## Equity compensation
Tax is due upon exercise on the difference between the fair market value (FMV) of the shares and the purchase price paid by the employee when the employee obtained beneficial ownership of the stock. Hence, there will be Egyptian payroll tax due in Egypt as the shares are exercised.
## Business income
For self-employment income, the employer is taxed at the normal tax brackets.
## Capital gains
The income tax law defines capital gains as the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value/selling price of the share. As for listed shares acquired before 1 July 2014 and sold after that date, the capital gain will be calculated as the difference between either the acquisition price or the closing price on 30 June 2014 (whichever is higher) and the selling price.
### Capital gains tax (CGT) treatment applicable to resident individuals
The latest tax law amendments (Law No. 30 of 2023) provide additional CGT relief for individuals upon meeting specific criteria.
### Capital gains tax treatment applicable to non-resident individuals
## Returns received from funds
Under the newly amended tax law treatment, the gains/returns received from funds by natural persons will be subject to a flat tax rate of 5%.
## Dividend income
### Dividend income treatment applicable to resident individuals
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to resident shareholders. A 5% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX to resident shareholders.
### Dividend income treatment applicable to non-resident individuals
A 10% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies unlisted on the EGX to non-resident shareholders. A 5% WHT will be imposed on dividends paid by Egyptian companies listed on the EGX to non-resident shareholders.
## Interest income
Interest income received from local banks is not taxable for residents in Egypt.
Interest income received from treasury bonds and treasury bills are subject to WHT at the rate of 20%.
The reduced rate from double taxation treaties (DTTs) applies for non-residents.
## Rental income
According to article 39 of the Egyptian Income Tax Law, taxable revenue shall be determined on the basis of the actual rental value after deducting 50% there from in return for all costs and expenses concerning the revenues resulting from renting any realty or part of it according to the provisions of the Civil Code.
The normal tax brackets are imposed on the rental amount after the deduction of the 50% mentioned above.
## Exempt income
Income from pensions and end of service bonuses are exempt from income tax.
