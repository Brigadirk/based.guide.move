## Overview
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Montenegro, a country located in Southeast Europe, is bordered by the Adriatic Sea to the southwest, Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, and Albania to the southeast. Montenegro is divided into 23 municipalities, with Podgorica as the capital. The official language is Montenegrin, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta. Over the subsequent centuries, Montenegro was able to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th centuries, Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes. In 1852, it was transformed into a secular principality. After World War I, Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. At the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia. This federation ended after an election, and Montenegro formally declared its independence on 3 June 2006.
The dissolution of the political union with Serbia in 2006 led to separate membership in several international financial institutions, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. On 18 January 2007, Montenegro joined the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Montenegro signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the European Union (EU) in October 2007. On 17 December 2011, Montenegro joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) and on 5 June 2017 became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Montenegro is an official EU candidate country.
Over the past two decades, Montenegro's economy has transitioned from a state-led system to a more market-oriented one, marked by the process of privatisation, the adoption of the euro in 2002 despite not being a member of the Eurozone, and significant growth in the tourism sector.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The main principles of the Montenegrin VAT are in line with the European Union (EU) Sixth Directive guidelines. Taxable supplies are subject to a general 21% VAT rate; however, certain supplies are taxed at a reduced 7% rate (e.g. bread, milk, books, medicines) and 0% rate (e.g. export of goods, supply of gasoline for vessels in international traffic).
In principle, the VAT base is comprised of consideration (in cash, goods, or services) received for supplies, including taxes, except VAT (e.g. customs, excise duty), and direct costs (e.g. commissions, cost of packing, transport). If the consideration is not paid in cash, the tax base will be the market value of the goods or services received at the time of supply. Furthermore, if an exchange of goods for services takes place, the tax base represents the value of the received good or service.
Registration for VAT in Montenegro may be either voluntary or mandatory. Voluntary VAT registration is possible for taxpayers who have not realised turnover exceeding EUR 30,000 in the last 12-month period. Once registered, a company may not apply for deregistration for at least three years. VAT registration is mandatory for an entity that realises turnover exceeding the EUR 30,000 threshold in any 12-month period.
VAT is calculated and paid on a calendar-month basis. VAT calculated on imports is paid along with customs duties to the Customs Authorities.
## Customs duty
Customs rates stipulated by international agreements are only applied to goods with preferential origin from countries covered by such agreements. The most important free trade agreements that Montenegro signed are with the European Union, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) states, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine.
## Excise duty
Legal entities that are importers or producers of the following products are subject to excise duty:
### Tax on coffee
Montenegro has a specific tax on coffee, which is payable on coffee imported and produced in Montenegro. The tax rate varies from EUR 0.80/kg to EUR 1.30/kg, depending on the type of the coffee. Tax on coffee is also payable for products and beverages that contain coffee. The tax rate for these products is EUR 2.50/kg for one kg of net coffee contained in the final product.
## Property tax
Property tax is payable by legal entities who own or have user rights over real estate located in Montenegro. The annual tax is levied at proportional rates, ranging from 0.25% to 1% on the market value of assets as of 1 January of the current year. In case of acquisition of new property, the taxpayer is obligated to submit a tax return to the tax authorities within 30 days from the acquisition date (i.e. registration return for property tax) and to declare annual property tax by the submission of annual returns. Tax is payable in two instalments, based on decisions issued by the tax authorities.
## Property transfer tax
Transfer tax of 3% is payable on the acquisition of ownership rights over immovable property.
The taxable base is the market value of the immovable property at the time of the acquisition. A taxpayer (i.e. the acquirer of immovable property) is obligated to self-assess a tax liability, submit a tax return, and settle a tax liability within 15 days from the contract date.
## Stamp taxes
No stamp taxes are in place in Montenegro.
## Payroll tax
Employment income includes all receipts paid or provided to an individual based on employment (salaries, pensions, benefits in kind, insurance premiums, benefits, and awards above the non-taxable thresholds). Income generated through other types of personal engagements similar to employment (e.g. temporary jobs) is also considered employment income.
While employees are the taxpayers, the employer is responsible for calculating and withholding personal income tax (PIT) on behalf of its employees.
As of 1 January 2022, progressive taxation of salary and income earned by entrepreneurs is introduced. Proportional 15% tax rate is introduced to other types of income.
Monthly salary is taxed in the following manner:
Monthly income earned by entrepreneurs is taxed in the following manner:
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions for pension and disability insurance, health insurance, and unemployment insurance are calculated and withheld by an employer from the salary paid to an employee. Unlike the other two types of social security contributions, pension and disability insurance contributions are subject to a specific annual cap (EUR 61,519 for 2023).
Social security contributions are payable by the employer and employee at different rates. The amount borne by the employer is treated as an operating cost while the portion payable by the employee is taken from the gross salary.
The rates paid by the employer are as follows:
The rates paid by the employee are as follows:
For other types of income, contributions are payable at specific rates depending on the type of income.
## Environmental charges
Legal entities are subject to environmental charges for the following:

## Taxable period
The tax year in Montenegro is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Tax returns and supplementary documents (e.g. tax depreciation form) must be filed with the tax authorities by the end of March of the following year.
The possibility to submit tax returns electronically has been introduced.
## Payment of tax
CIT is paid by the end of March of the following year for the previous year. Alternatively, CIT may be paid in six annual instalments at the taxpayer’s request.
## Taxation of non-residents
Montenegrin CIT Law contains specific rules for assessment and mechanisms for taxation of:
The non-resident is obligated to file the tax return, via their Montenegrin tax representative (tax agent), within 30 days from generating income. Tax liability will be determined based on the decision issued by the Montenegrin tax authorities.
## Tax audit process
There are no particular provisions regarding the audit cycle in Montenegro.
## Statute of limitations
The right to assess taxes expires within five years after the end of the year in which the tax should have been assessed.
The right to collect taxes expires within five years after the end of the year in which tax has been determined.
According to our best knowledge, the focus of the tax authorities is VAT (when the VAT refund is claimed), proper documenting of expenses, and WHT. Apart from this, we are expecting that in the near future the focus of the tax authorities will be transfer pricing, following trends of the countries in the region.

WHT will also be payable on income earned by non-resident or resident individuals on the basis of repurchase of used products, semi-final products, and agricultural products from a manufacturer registered for VAT purposes.
Distributions of dividends and share of profits are also subject to WHT if the recipient is a Montenegrin resident (either an individual or legal entity).
The general WHT rate is 15%.
Application of a double tax treaty (DTT) may reduce or eliminate Montenegrin WHT. To qualify for the beneficial rates prescribed by the treaty, a non-resident must prove tax residency of a relevant treaty country and beneficial ownership over the income. In order to qualify for a preferential tax rate according to a DTT, a non-resident will need to provide the tax residency certificate filled out and stamped by the relevant authority of its country of residence.
Although Serbia is regarded as the legal successor of the Serbia and Montenegro State Union that ceased to exist in June 2006, the Republic of Montenegro, upon its Decision on Independence (dated 3 June 2006), continues to honour international treaties that were applicable in the State Union, including those executed by State Union’s legal predecessors (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, i.e. former Yugoslavia).

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions for pension and disability insurance and unemployment insurance are calculated and withheld by an employer from the salary paid to an employee. Unlike unemployment insurance contributions, pension and disability insurance contributions are subject to a specific annual cap.
Social security contributions are payable by the employer and employee at different rates. The amount borne by the employer is treated as an operating cost while the portion payable by the employee is taken from the gross salary.
The rates paid by the employer are as follows:
The rates paid by the employee are as follows:
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The main principles of the Montenegrin VAT are in line with the European Union (EU) Sixth Directive guidelines. Taxable supplies are subject to a general 21% VAT rate; however, certain supplies are taxed at a reduced 7% rate (e.g. bread, milk, books, medicines) and 0% rate (e.g. export of goods, supply of gasoline for vessels in international traffic).

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
A legal entity is considered to be a tax resident if it is incorporated in Montenegro. In addition, a foreign corporation may also be deemed a Montenegrin tax resident if the corporation has a place of effective management in Montenegro. No explicit rules exist for determination of effective management. In practice, it usually is the place where key managerial decisions are made or where the board of directors sits.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Montenegrin tax legislation contains very basic PE rules following, in main features, the guidelines set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Treaty. PE is defined as a fixed place of business through which a non-resident carries out business in Montenegro. PE is deemed to exist in case of a non-resident having one of the following in Montenegro: place of management, branch office, office, factory, workshop, mine, gas or oil site, stone pit, or any other place of natural resources exploitation in Montenegro. A construction site constitutes a PE only if construction activities last longer than six months.
PE is not deemed to exist in case of a non-resident having storage of inventory in Montenegro only for the purpose of delivery of goods or having operations in Montenegro that are of a preparatory or auxiliary nature.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciable assets are tangible and intangible assets with a useful life of at least one year and an individual acquisition value of at least EUR 300.
Fixed assets are divided into five depreciation groups, with depreciation rates prescribed for each group (I - 2.5%, II - 10%, III - 15%, IV - 20%, and V - 30%). A straight-line depreciation method is prescribed for assets classified in the first group (real estate), while a declining-balance method is applicable for assets classified in the other groups.
Amortisation of intangible assets (e.g. concessions, patents, copyrights, franchises, other rights) is performed using the proportional method based on the life of these investments.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is determined according to IFRS and is subject to impairment. There are no other special provisions on goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
There are no special provisions regarding treatment of start-up expenses. Consequently, they will be deductible if they are incurred for business purposes and properly documented under the general expense deductibility rule.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible if they are business related and properly documented. Also, interest and related cost of loans paid out to a creditor with the status of a related party are recognised as expenses only in the amount that does not exceed market interest rates between unrelated parties. The exceeding amount is not recognised as an expense, but it is included in the taxable profit and subject to the normal CIT rate.
Interest paid out to non-resident legal entities (unless it is revenue of a PE of a non-resident legal entity) is subject to WHT levied at 15%.
## Bad debt
Write-offs and provisions for doubtful debts are considered deductible, provided that:
## Charitable contributions
Expenses incurred for social purposes, reduction of poverty, protecting persons with disabilities, child and youth social care, elderly care, protection and promotion of human and minority rights, the rule of law, civil society and volunteerism, Montenegro’s Euro-Atlantic and European integration, art, technical culture, promotion of agriculture and rural development, sustainable development, consumer protection, gender equality, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and the fight against addictions are recognised for CIT purposes, up to a threshold of 3.5% of total revenue.
Expenditures for the above-mentioned purposes are recognised regardless of whether they are made in cash, goods, rights, or services.
Expenses incurred in this regard will be deductible for CIT purposes only if they are made to legal entities, which are engaged in provision of the aforementioned services in accordance with specific regulations, and if received funds are used by such entities exclusively for the above-mentioned purposes.
## Impairment of assets
Expenses incurred on the basis of impairment of assets are not deductible for CIT purposes. Impairment expenses are deductible in the period in which assets are disposed of or damaged due to *force majeure*.
## Salary costs and costs related to termination of employment
Salary costs, severance payments related to retirement of employees, costs related to technological surplus, and other payments related to termination of employment are recognised as deductible in the tax period in which they are paid (not in the period in which they are accrued).
## Fines and penalties
Penalty interest for late payment of taxes is not CIT deductible.
## Taxes
The basic deductibility rule is that business expenses incurred for business purposes are CIT deductible. Following that rule, CIT Law provides for full deductibility of taxes.
## Other significant items
The following expenditures are also recognised for CIT purposes, up to the prescribed threshold:
## Net operating losses
The taxpayer is entitled to carry forward losses incurred in an accounting period over the following five years. Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Supplies of goods or services from a foreign group entity not established in Montenegro to a Montenegrin entity must be valued at arm's length. Excess expenses recorded over market value are treated as non-deductible expenses. If the transaction with a related party is not in accordance with the arm's-length principle, the tax authorities are required to adjust the taxpayer's tax base.
With respect to payment of charges of a PE, CIT Law provides that administrative costs charged by the non-resident head office are non-deductible for CIT at the level of the PE.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Tax consolidation is permitted for a group of companies in which all of the members are Montenegrin residents and the parent company directly or indirectly controls at least 75% of the shares in the other companies. Each company files its own tax return, and the parent company files a consolidated tax return for the entire group.
Each company is taxed based on its contribution to the consolidated taxable profit (or loss) of the group.
Tax consolidation is binding for at least five years.
## Transfer pricing
A transfer price is the price of transactions between related parties. Related parties exist if there is a possibility of control or influence over business decisions between them. Ownership of 25% or more, or a majority of shares, is considered as potential control. Influence over business decisions exists when an associated party holds 25% or more, or individually holds the greatest portion, of votes in the taxpayer's management bodies. If the same persons participate in management or control of both companies, a connection between them will be deemed to exist. Family member of a person that has 25% or more of voting power or has 25% or more of profit share is considered a related party.
Transactions between related parties must be valuated at arm's length. If the transaction with a related party is not in accordance with the arm's-length principle, the tax authorities are required to adjust the taxpayer's tax base.
Montenegro CIT Law recognises the following methods for determining arm’s-length prices:
There is a prescribed materiality threshold (EUR 75,000) for documenting transactions in short form.
Large taxpayers are obligated to submit the documentation, while other taxpayers should have the transfer pricing documentation in place and provide it on the request of the tax authorities within 45 days.
The submission deadline will be 30 June in the first couple of years (until 2027), after which the documentation shall be submitted alongside the tax return (no later than three months from the expiration of the fiscal period).
The Ministry of Finance will publish rates that are in line with the arm's-length principle for loans and other financial instruments. Also, the Ministry of Finance shall prescribe a more detailed manner of determining transfer prices and the content of documentation, in accordance with the OECD Guidelines and other international organisations.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation provisions in place in Montenegro.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Montenegro.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
The CIT Law provides four tax incentives related to businesses: one for newly established businesses in underdeveloped municipalities, one for non-governmental organisations (NGOs), a discount for settling of CIT liability by the prescribed deadline, and a foreign tax credit.
## Tax exemption for newly established businesses in underdeveloped municipalities
Newly established production companies located in underdeveloped municipalities are entitled to an eight-year tax exemption. The maximum amount of tax exemption for the period of eight years is limited to EUR 200,000.
The incentive is applicable to companies whose business units are established in underdeveloped regions. In that case, tax holiday is proportional to the amount of profit generated by such unit over the total profit for the period of eight years from establishment of the unit.
The tax incentive is not applicable to a taxpayer operating in the sectors of (i) primary production of agricultural products, (ii) transport, (iii) shipbuilding, (iv) fishery, (v) steel production, (vi) trade, and (vii) catering, except primary catering facilities.
## Tax exemption for NGOs
NGOs registered for business activity are permitted to decrease the corporate tax base by EUR 4,000, with the condition that profit is used for realisation of the main goals of an NGO.
## Foreign tax credit
Resident taxpayers are entitled to a tax credit up to the amount of corporate tax paid in another country on income realised in that country. This tax credit is equal to the tax paid in another country but may not exceed the amount of the tax that would have been paid in Montenegro.

## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) intergovernmental agreement (IGA)
Montenegro and the United States reached an ‘agreement in substance’ on a Model 1 IGA and consented to this status as of 30 June 2014. In accordance with this status, the text of such IGA has not been released, and financial institutions in Montenegro are allowed to register on the FATCA registration website consistent with the treatment of having an IGA in effect, provided that the jurisdiction continues to demonstrate firm resolve to sign the IGA as soon as possible.
On 1 June 2017, Montenegro signed an IGA in order to implement provisions of the FATCA and to promote transparency between Montenegro and the United States on tax matters. The Agreement was ratified on 1 March 2018, and it is applicable from 28 March 2018.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Resident taxpayers are entitled to a tax relief up to the amount of tax paid in another country on income realised in that country. This tax relief is equal to the tax paid in another country but may not exceed the amount of the tax that would have been paid in Montenegro.
In case the income is received from a country with which Montenegro has a DTT in place, the method for avoidance of the double taxation prescribe by the DTT (credit or exemption) will be applicable.
