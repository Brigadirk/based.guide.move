# Serbia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Serbia is a landlocked country in Central Southeast Europe. It is bordered by Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; North Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the west. Its capital and largest city is Belgrade. The official language of Serbia is Serbian, and the currency is the Serbian dinar (RSD).
The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in 1918. Its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Yugoslavia (i.e. the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) joined the United Nations (UN) as an original member in 1945. By 1992, it had been effectively dissolved into five independent states (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), which were all subsequently admitted to the United Nations. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose name later changed to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, was admitted to the United Nations on 1 November 2000. The state union effectively came to an end after Montenegro's formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006.
After renewing its membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2000, Serbia continued to reintegrate into the international community by rejoining the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Serbia has made progress in trade liberalisation and enterprise restructuring and privatisation, including telecommunications and small and medium-size firms. It has made some progress towards European Union (EU) membership, signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Brussels in May 2008 and with fully implementing the Interim Trade Agreement with the European Union in February 2010. The European Union granted Serbia candidate status in March 2012.
Serbia is also pursuing membership in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the process of accession to the WTO is expected to continue during 2024.
The IMF projects that Serbia's real gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by 3.0% in 2024.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
WHT is also payable on a non-resident’s income realised on the basis of performing variety, entertaining, artistic, sports, and similar programs in Serbia, which is not taxed as income of an individual (performer, musician, sportsman, etc.).
In order to benefit from application of a relevant DTT, non-residents (i.e. the income recipient) must provide a tax residency certificate on the form prescribed by the Serbian Ministry of Finance stamped by the relevant body from the non-resident's country of residence.
Special WHT rules apply in case of non-resident entities from tax havens. WHT is payable at the rate of 25% on royalties, interest, income from lease of immovable property and other assets, and service fees paid to non-resident entities from tax havens. Dividend payments to non-residents from tax havens are subject to WHT at 20%. The Serbian Ministry of Finance publishes a list of jurisdictions that are regarded as tax havens ([http://www.poreskauprava.gov.rs/pravna-lica/pregled-propisa/prav ilnici/312/pravilnik-o-listi-jurisdikcija-sa-preferencijalnim-poreskim-sistemom.html](http://www.poreskauprava.gov.rs/pravna-lica/pregled-propisa/prav%20ilnici/312/pravilnik-o-listi-jurisdikcija-sa-preferencijalnim-poreskim-sistemom.html)).
WHT rates envisaged by applicable DTTs are provided in the following table.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | Applicable from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties (3) |

Notes
1. If the recipient company owns/controls at least 25% (5% depending on the relevant DTT) of the equity of the paying company, the lower of the two rates applies.
2. The treaty has not been ratified by one of the parties.
3. A tax rate of 5% will be applicable to literary, scientific, and work of art; films and works created like films; or other source of reproduction tone or picture. A tax rate of 10% will be applicable to patents, petty patents, brands, models and samples, technical innovations, secret formulas, or technical procedures.
4. Only in cases when dividends are to be paid to Serbian residents. If paid to Malaysian residents, they are taxable at 20% in Serbia.
5. A 0% rate is applicable in cases when the income recipient is the government or government owned banks. In all other cases, a higher rate envisaged by the DTT should apply.
6. WHT rate refers solely to dividends distributed from Serbia. In Malta, WHT cannot be higher than CIT on profit before dividend distribution.
7. A 0% rate is applicable in cases when the dividend income recipient is the government of the contracting state.
8. Besides ownership requirement (*see Note 1*), 365 holding period criterion needs to be met in order to apply lower of the two DTT rates on dividend payments.

# Serbia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Taxable profit is determined by adjusting the accounting profit as stated in the profit and loss statement (determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS] and local accounting and audit legislation) and in accordance with the provisions of the CIT Law.
For taxpayers who, according to local legislation, are not obligated to apply IFRS, taxable profit is determined according to the special guidelines prescribed by the Ministry of Finance.
## Inventory valuation
Cost of materials and the purchase value of merchandise are tax deductible up to an amount calculated by applying the average weighted cost method or the first in first out (FIFO) method. If another method is used, an adjustment for tax purposes should be made.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are generated by the sale or other transfer against consideration of real estate, rights related to intellectual property, as well as shares, stocks, securities, certain bonds, investment units, and digital property. A capital gain is determined as the difference between the sale and purchase price of the asset concerned, determined in accordance with the provisions of the Law. If the amount is negative, a capital loss is realised.
Capital gains and operational profit are disclosed in the same tax return, but they are taxed separately. Consequently, capital gains/losses cannot be used to offset business losses/gains.
However, capital gains can be offset with capital losses occurring in the same period. A capital loss can be carried forward for five years.
The capital gains tax rate is 15%.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Serbian company from another Serbian company are not subject to CIT.
Dividends received from a non-resident will be treated as taxable income of a Serbian company and subject to 15% CIT. However, a Serbian entity will have the right to decrease its tax liability by taking a tax credit for the WHT and underlying CIT paid in a subsidiary's country, provided that the taxpayer holds at least 10% of the shares in the subsidiary. If the taxpayer holds less than 10% of the shares in the subsidiary, the tax credit should not exceed the amount of tax that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](serbia/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
## Interest income
Interest income will be included in accounting profit determined in accordance with IFRS and will be taxable at the CIT rate of 15%. A Serbian resident has the right to decrease its CIT liability for WHT on interest paid abroad. The amount of the tax credit should not exceed the amount of CIT that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income will be treated as business income and subject to the general CIT rate.
A resident taxpayer also has the right to decrease its CIT liability for WHT on royalties paid abroad. The amount of the tax credit should not exceed the amount of CIT that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income.
## Unrealised currency exchange gains
Unrealised currency exchange gains will be included in accounting profits under IFRS rules. Serbian legislation does not provide any exception of taxation of this income.
## Foreign income
Companies resident in Serbia are taxed on their worldwide income.
When profit generated in another country is taxed in the foreign country, a company has the right to decrease its tax liability by claiming a tax credit from the tax authorities in Serbia (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](serbia/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
There are no provisions that provide for the possibility that taxation of income earned abroad may be deferred.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT was introduced on 1 January 2005 and generally follows the European Union's (EU’s) Sixth Directive.
In addition to these tax rates, there is a 0% tax rate with the right of deduction of the input VAT that applies to the export of goods, transport and other services directly related to exports, international air transport, etc.
The tax exemption without the right of deduction of the input VAT applies to trading in shares and other securities, insurance and reinsurance, and the lease of apartments, business premises, etc.
A taxpayer for VAT purposes is a person who independently, and in the course of its business activities, undertakes the supply of goods and services or import of goods. Business activity is defined as the permanent activity of a manufacturer, salesperson, or service provider for the purpose of gaining income, including the activities of exploitation of natural resources, agriculture, forestry, and self-employed activities. A branch or other operating unit can be a taxpayer.
Foreign entities that carry on taxable supply of goods and services in Serbia, as well as supply of goods and services for which a tax exemption is prescribed with the right to deduct input VAT, are required to register for VAT and to appoint a fiscal representative irrespective of the amount of the turnover in the previous 12 months. A foreign entity that performs a taxable supply of goods and services exclusively to VAT payers or entities referred to as governmental institutions (which includes the Republic and its authorities, the territorial autonomy and local self-government authorities, as well as legal entities established under law or other act of the Republic, territorial autonomy, or local government authority for the purpose of execution of activities of the state administration or local government) or performs supply of goods that are in the procedure of customs warehouse in accordance with customs regulations, as well as passengers transportation service by buses (in special case envisaged by the Law), has no obligation to appoint a fiscal representative in Serbia and to register for VAT. A foreign taxpayer that fails to register for VAT in Serbia may be subject to penalties for non-compliance. If a foreign supplier does not appoint a fiscal representative, VAT is due by the Serbian recipient of the goods or services.
The usual taxable period is a calendar month; however, if a taxpayer’s total annual turnover is less than 50 million Serbian dinars (RSD), the taxable period is a calendar quarter. For newly established businesses, the VAT period is the calendar month for the current and next calendar year. Taxpayers are required to submit returns within 15 days of the end of each taxable period. Tax debtors who are not taxpayers are required to submit returns within ten days of the end of the taxable period in which the tax liability arose.
As of 1 July 2018, VAT payers are obligated to submit a VAT assessment overview to the tax authorities, along with the VAT return.
As of 1 January 2019, foreign taxpayers have the right to a VAT refund even if they perform taxable supply of goods and services in Serbia to a Serbian VAT payer.
## Customs duties
Goods imported into Serbia are subject to customs duty rates provided in the Law on Customs Tariff. These rates are *ad valorem* (the only exception is related to the importation of other cigarettes containing tobacco, where a combined *ad valorem* and specific customs duty rate is prescribed).
Customs duty rates in Serbia range from 0% to 57.6%, with most being under 30%. At the moment, the 57.6% rate only applies to cigarettes containing tobacco.
Serbia has signed the following Free Trade Agreements that envisage application of preferential customs duty rates for importation of goods originating in countries with which the Free Trade Agreement is signed:
## Excise duties
Excise duties are levied on the following goods:
Excise duty in Serbia is specific (for oil derivatives, alcoholic beverages, cigars, cigarillos, coffee, electricity, nicotine bags, liquids for filling electric cigars, and natural gas), *ad valorem* (for pipe tobacco), and combined (specific + *ad valorem* on retail price for cigarettes).
## Property tax
Property tax is payable annually on a quarterly basis in Serbia by all legal entities and individuals who own or have rights over real estate located in Serbia, such as:
Where the taxpayer keeps books, the property tax on real estate is levied at a flat rate that cannot exceed 0.40%.
## Transfer tax
Transfer tax is levied on the transfer for a consideration of rights over real estate when VAT is not payable on such a transfer; intellectual property rights; ownership over used vehicles, vessels, and aircraft (unless owned by the state); right to use urban and/or public building land; as well as rights relating to expropriated real estate.
The contract price is used as a tax base; however, the tax authorities have the right to adjust the tax base in case they estimate that the price agreed to in the contract is lower than under market conditions. The tax is payable at a 2.5% rate.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Serbia.
## Capital gains tax of non-residents
Capital gains realised by non-residents from both residents or other non-residents are subject to 20% capital gain tax. Non-residents should appoint a fiscal representative in Serbia who should submit a tax return within 30 days from the realisation of capital gain. Based on the tax return, tax authorities will issue a decision assessing tax liability (if any).
In order to benefit from application of a relevant double tax treaty (DTT), the same rules are applicable as for withholding tax (WHT). Non-residents (i.e. the income recipient) must provide a tax residency certificate (on the form prescribed by the Serbian Ministry of Finance stamped by the relevant body from the non-resident's country of residence or official translation of certificate issued by foreign tax authorities), and the income recipient must be the beneficial owner of the income.
## Payroll taxes and social security contributions
The employer is liable to withhold personal income tax (PIT) and social security contributions on payment of salaries to employees, at the following rates:
The tax and contributions base is gross salary. The social security contributions base is limited to five average monthly salaries in Serbia.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Taxable period
The tax period in Serbia is the calendar year. However, entities have a possibility to opt for a different tax period other than the calendar year (subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance), but still 12-months long. Once approved, such tax period must be applied for at least five years.
## Tax returns
A newly established company needs to register with the tax authorities within 15 days of registration with the Serbian Business Registry.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable monthly in advance instalments by the 15th day of the following month for the prior calendar month. The amount of payable advances is determined on the basis of a company's CIT calculation for the previous year.
The due date for final settlement of CIT liability is the date of filing the annual tax return.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities may undertake an unlimited number of tax audits in respect of the same taxes within a reviewed period. In principle, re-performing of an audit of the same tax within a reviewed period is based on existence of new facts that were previously unavailable to the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period for assessment of tax liabilities is five years from the year in which tax should have been assessed. The statute of limitations for collection of tax liabilities is five years from the year in which tax was due for payment. This is with the exception of pension insurance contributions, which do not become statute barred.
The statute of limitations commences from 1 January of the year following the year in which the tax return/liability was due.
Historically, audits by the tax authority have been focused primarily on VAT, PIT, and social security contributions assessment.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Residents are taxable on their worldwide income, whereas non-residents are taxable on their Serbian-sourced income and worldwide income related to their work in/for the Republic of Serbia.
Tax rates are flat, range from 10% to 20%, and the definition of the taxable base depends on the type of income. *See* *the [Income determination](serbia/individual/income-determination.html) section* *for more information.*
### Supplementary annual taxation
In addition to the PIT, all taxpayers are subject to supplementary annual PIT. This is an additional tax that is paid by individuals whose income exceeds a prescribed threshold. Certain types of income are excluded from supplementary annual PIT, such as investment income and capital gains.
If the individual is a Serbian tax resident, one is subject to Serbian supplementary annual tax on one's net worldwide income exceeding a prescribed threshold, whereas Serbian tax non-residents are liable to report their Serbian-sourced annual net income.
The progressive rates apply depending on the income level. For the taxable income exceeding prescribed thresholds, between three and six times the average annual salary\*, the tax rate is 10%. For net income exceeding six times the average annual salary\*, the tax rate is the previous 10% with an additional 15%. For taxpayers who, on the last day of the calendar year for which the supplementary annual PIT is determined, are less than 40 years of age, the annual sum of earnings and taxable income is additionally reduced by the amount of three average annual wages per employee paid in the Republic in the year for which the tax is determined.
\* *As per official data published by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia.*

## Tax returns
For each source of income taxable by the PIT (s*ee the [Income determination](serbia/individual/income-determination.html) section* *for more information*), the tax law stipulates specific deadlines and methods for filing tax returns.
Tax returns are submitted electronically.
### Employment income
The employer is obligated to calculate tax, submit a tax return, and pay the PIT as well as the accompanying social security contributions on behalf of the taxpayer when disbursing each individual salary.
### Offshore income
The deadline for submission of tax returns for offshore income is 30 days following the receipt of the income.
### Supplementary annual taxation
An individual shall pay supplementary annual PIT if one’s income in a calendar year was higher than three times the average annual wage/salary per employee paid out in the Republic of Serbia in the year for which the tax is being charged, as published by the republic agency in charge of statistics.
The supplementary annual tax return is generated in the tax authority system by 1 April of the current year for the previous tax year period. The deadline for the taxpayer to check and amend the tax return in the tax authority system is 15 May of the current year.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
According to the CIT Law, assets qualifying for tax depreciation are tangible assets with useful life over one year, which are recognised as non-current assets under IFRS, excluding renewable natural resources, and intangibles. Goodwill cannot be depreciated for tax purposes.
Tax depreciable assets, except intangible assets, are divided into five groups, with the tax depreciation rates ranging from 2.5% to 30%.
Tax depreciation of fixed assets classified in tax depreciation groups II through V is calculated by using the straight-line depreciation method. In case amortisation costs calculated in accordance with the accounting rules are determined in the lower amount comparing to the amount of depreciation costs assessed by using tax depreciation rates, accounting depreciation is recognised as tax deductible cost.
Tax depreciation of intangible assets and leases recognised as assets is equal to their accounting depreciation.
Assets classified into groups II through V and which were acquired before 31 December 2018 are depreciated for tax purposes by applying the declining-balance method.
## Goodwill
Goodwill is not subject to tax amortisation.
## Start-up expenses
Generally, start-up expenses are tax deductible for CIT purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest on related-party loans exceeding thin capitalisation and transfer pricing thresholds are not deductible (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debts
Bad debt provisions are generally tax deductible if they are at least 60 days overdue. Provisions have to be made individually for each receivable.
Write-off of individual debts, except for those from debtors who are at the same time creditors, is recognised as an expense under the following conditions:
Taxable income should be increased for receivables that are written-off and do not meet the above requirements and for which tax-deductible provisions were previously made.
## Charitable contributions
Expenses for health care, scientific, educational, humanitarian, religious, ecological, cultural, and sport related purposes, as well as humanitarian aid given to the Republic of Serbia, its autonomous provinces, and the local government for sanitation of consequences that emerged during emergency situations, are deductible, at up to 5% of total revenues.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties (both commercial and those charged by the authorities) are not deductible.
## Taxes
All taxes, duties, and contributions that do not depend on the profitability of the company are deductible in the tax period that the liability in this respect was settled.
## Other significant items
The following other expenses are not recognised for CIT purposes:
The following other expenses are recognised for CIT purposes only up to a certain limit:
## Net operating losses
The taxpayer has the right to carry forward and utilise tax losses incurred over the following five years.
Carryback rules do not exist in Serbia.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, there are no restrictions on the deductibility of royalties and service fees paid to foreign affiliates, provided they are at arm's length, appropriately documented (by agreements, contracts, calculation sheets, etc.), and incurred for business purposes only.
Payment of interest to foreign affiliates is restricted and regulated by thin capitalisation rules and transfer pricing rules (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Tax grouping/consolidation is allowed to a group of companies where all members are Serbian residents and one company directly or indirectly controls at least 75% of the shares in another company. Each company files its own tax balance sheet, and the parent company files a consolidated tax balance sheet for the whole group.
In the consolidated tax balance sheet, losses of one or more companies are offset by the profits of other related companies. Each company is liable for the portion of tax attributable to its share of the group's taxable profit.
Once approved by the Ministry of Finance, tax grouping/consolidation applies for at least five years.
## Transfer pricing
A transfer price is the price of transactions between related parties. Related parties exist if there is a possibility of control or influence over business decisions between them. Ownership of 25% or more, or a majority of shares, is considered as potential control. Influence over business decisions exists when an associated party holds 25% or more, or individually holds the greatest portion, of votes in the taxpayer's management bodies. If the same persons participate in management or control of both companies, a connection between them will be deemed to exist.
Close family members are also regarded as related parties. Non-resident entities from tax havens are considered as related parties of resident entities. The Serbian Ministry of Finance prescribed the list of countries that are to be considered as tax havens for the application of relevant CIT Law provisions.
It is mandatory to prepare and submit annual transfer pricing documentation (in local language) together with the CIT return. It should be noted that the Master File / Local File concept envisaged by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Action 13 has not been introduced in local legislation, which prescribes mandatory content of annual transfer pricing documentation. A company should disclose all transactions with related parties (whether they are domestic, cross-border, or with a company located in a tax haven) at transfer prices and at arm's-length prices in its CIT return and document them within the annual transfer pricing documentation.
When a difference between arm’s-length prices and transfer prices is determined, positive differences (adjustments of expenses) and negative differences (adjustments of revenues) between these prices are included in taxable profit.
Serbian CIT Law recognises the following methods for determining arm’s-length prices:
It is mandatory to prepare and submit transfer pricing documentation together with the CIT return.
### Transfer pricing rules for intra-group loans
Any interest incurred on related-party loans exceeding the arm's-length interest rate is not tax deductible. Arm's-length interest is deemed to be the:
These indicators are determined by the National Bank of Serbia and published by the Ministry of Finance. However, taxpayers are entitled to determine market interest rates by using all general methods for determining arm’s-length interest rates. In case the taxpayer decides to determine interest rates by applying general methods, it will be obligated to apply such interest rates for assessment of all related-party loans.
Transfer pricing rules in this respect are applied up to the amount of tax-deductible interest determined in accordance with the thin capitalisation threshold (*see below*).
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
A resident taxpayer that is considered to be the ultimate parent entity (UPE) of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group whose total consolidated group revenue in the previous year exceeds 750 million euros (EUR) is required to file a CbC Report. CbC reporting in Serbia is introduced and applicable as of 2020. There is no CbC notification requirement.
## Thin capitalisation
The interest and related costs will be fully deductible if the loans from related parties do not exceed four times the taxpayer's net equity (ten times for banks and leasing companies). The amount of a taxpayer's net equity for this purpose is calculated as the average of the total assets less total liabilities at the beginning and the end of the year, while the amount of loans from related parties is calculated as a daily average for the year.
In cases where the loans from related parties exceed the prescribed threshold, the amount of non-deductible interest will be calculated as proportional to the amount of loans exceeding the 4:1 (10:1) threshold.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Serbia.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A Serbian entity is entitled to a tax credit for the WHT paid on foreign-sourced dividends and underlying CIT paid abroad (by its non-resident subsidiary), provided that the taxpayer holds at least 10% of the shares in the subsidiary for at least one year before filing a return. If the taxpayer holds less than 10% of the shares in the subsidiary, the tax credit should not exceed the amount of tax that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income. Non-utilised tax credit can be carried forward by the parent company for five years.
A resident taxpayer also has the right to decrease its tax liability for WHT paid abroad on interest and authorship fees. The tax credit should not exceed the amount of tax that would be paid in Serbia on that income, where the tax basis represents 40% of the received gross income. Carryforward of unused tax credits is not allowed.
## Tax holiday
A ten-year tax holiday is available for companies with a minimum investment in property, plant, and equipment (PPE) of RSD 1 billion. To qualify for the credit, a taxpayer must employ at least 100 new workers for an indefinite period. The tax holiday is available for the ten-year period in proportion to the investment made. The number of employees employed in the tax period in which the taxpayer qualified for the tax holiday must be retained throughout the whole tax holiday period.
## Royalty income relief
80% of qualified royalty income generated by the copyright or similar rights holders (inscribed in relevant register in Serbia) can be excluded from the tax base. Qualifying income should be excluded upon decreasing this income for the amount of tax deductible R&D costs incurred in relation to development of such copyright/similar right.
## Investments into newly established companies performing innovative activities
Investments into newly established companies, performing innovative activities, entitles a taxpayer to a tax credit in the amount of 30% of the investments made. The maximum amount of tax credit cannot exceed RSD 100 million.

## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
FATCA is a set of regulations of the United States adopted in order to combat tax evasion. It requires that foreign financial institutions or other financial intermediaries participate in preventing tax evasion by reporting (i.e. providing) information concerning US 'account holders', which include bank account holders, investors, and shareholders, to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
The Republic of Serbia and the United States have begun active cooperation in relation to the implementation of FATCA regulation as of 2014. In accordance with the above-mentioned cooperation, as of 30 June 2014, Serbia has been treated as a jurisdiction with an 'agreement in substance' on the terms of an intergovernmental agreement (IGA), that is the United States had treated Serbia as the jurisdiction in which the Agreement was in force.
As a result of the cooperation, on 10 April 2019, the government of the Republic of Serbia and the United States signed an IGA to implement FATCA regulation. Serbia signed a Model 1 IGA to implement FATCA.
Serbian Parliament adopted the Law Ratifying this IGA on 23 December 2019 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia - International Agreements, No 16 оf 27 December 2019).
## Multilateral instrument (MLI)
On 5 June 2018, Serbia deposited its ratification instrument for the OECD Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('Multilateral instrument' or 'MLI').
The MLI enables jurisdictions to swiftly implement the results of the BEPS project into bilateral tax treaties worldwide. It modifies the application of thousands bilateral tax treaties concluded to eliminate double taxation.
Serbia is the sixth jurisdiction to deposit its ratification instrument after Austria, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Poland, and Slovenia. The MLI entered into force on 1 October 2018 for Serbia.
## Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes
Serbia joined the OECD’s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes in March 2018, thus committing to implement the standard of transparency and exchange of information in international tax affairs.
At the end of the year 2023, the OECD’s Global Forum published a second-round peer review report on Serbia’s implementation of the standard on transparency and exchange of information.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Serbian residents are taxed on their worldwide income. When income generated in another country is taxed there, the taxpayer has the right to decrease the tax liability by claiming a tax credit to the tax authorities in Serbia. This tax credit is equal to the tax paid in another country, but it cannot exceed the amount of the tax that would have been paid in Serbia.
In case the income is received from a country with which Serbia has DTT in place, the method for avoidance of the double taxation prescribed by the DTT (credit or exemption) will be applicable.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
The last significant amendments to the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law, applicable as of January 2020, introduced an obligation of documenting payments made to employees for the non-taxable compensation of transportation costs for arrival and departure from work.
The amendments to the PIT Law also introduce a specific set of criteria for determining under what circumstances payments to entrepreneurs should be reclassified for taxation purposes as other income of individuals without the right to deduct standardised expenditures and new tax incentives for hiring new employees who fulfil certain conditions.
The salary tax rate remains 10%.
With the latest changes, applicable as of January 2024, the non-taxable amount for salary tax increased to 25,000 Serbian dinars (RSD).

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 June 2024
Employment income is considered to be the agreed salary, as well as other earnings of the employee, arising from employment. Employment income remains subject to PIT at a 10% flat rate after deducting the RSD 25,000 non-taxable salary cap, payable by a method of withholding. The taxable base is gross salary, including fringe benefits.
Other types of income (e.g. royalties income, business income, investment income, real estate lease income, capital gains, and other income) are subject to a flat rate tax that ranges from 10% to 20%, depending on the type of income concerned.
Any taxpayer who earns a salary and other revenues in or from another state, a diplomatic or consular mission of a foreign state, or an international organisation, or representatives of such a mission or organisation, shall calculate and pay PIT in accordance with the Law, provided tax has not already been charged and paid by the payer of the revenue.
## Employment income
The taxable person is the employee, but the employer is responsible for calculating and withholding PIT on behalf of its employees at the moment of salary payment.
The taxable base is gross salary reduced for the non-taxable salary cap of RSD 25,000 and includes fringe benefits such as company-provided housing and use of a company’s car. Use of a company’s car for both private and business purposes by an employee is taxed as salary, at a tax base equal to 1% of the car’s market value on 31 December of the previous year for each month of use. The taxable base for company-provided housing is the relevant rent fee available on the market in the location where the apartment in question is situated.
The taxable base also includes social security contributions on behalf of the employee.
## Entrepreneurial income
Income from self-employment includes income generated from agriculture and forestry, business activity, and provision of professional and/or intellectual services, as well as revenue from other activities, unless such income was taxed on some other grounds under the present Law.
In addition, any individual who is a registered VAT payer is considered to be a taxpayer on income realised from self-employment.
If a sole-proprietor is unable to keep books, or in the case of certain other difficulties, the so-called ‘lump-sum’ tax will be applicable.
## Capital gains
Income subject to tax as capital gains includes income generated by the sale or other transfer against consideration of the right of ownership to real estate, permanent right of use of an urban land building, intellectual property rights and share in the assets of legal entities, and shares and other securities, other than bonds, digital property, and certain investments units.
The taxable base is the difference between the sale price of rights, securities, shares, and their purchase price adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the PIT Law.
The tax rate applicable to capital gains is 15%.
Residents are eligible for an exemption from capital gains tax on the condition that the capital assets in question have been held for a period exceeding ten consecutive years.
## Investment income
Income subject to tax as investment income includes interest on loans, savings, and other deposits, dividends/shares in profits, income from investment units of open investment funds, income based on the ownership of an investment unit of an alternative investment fund (except for the fee for the transfer of that investment unit), receipts on a profit sharing basis, and taking from the assets and using the services of the company by the company’s owner for one’s personal needs, as well as the revenues from real estate (immovable property).
Tax is not payable on the interest accrued from savings in Serbian dinars and on government bonds.
The tax base for all types of investment income is considered to be the total gross amount of such income.
The tax rate applicable to investment income is 15%.
## Real estate lease income
Income subject to tax as real estate income includes revenues from lease or sub-lease of real estate.
The tax rate applicable to real estate income is 20%.
For certain types of real estate lease income, there are specific rules (e.g. one day rental).
## Royalty income
Income subject to tax as royalty income includes revenue from copyrights, rights related to copyright, and industrial property rights.
The taxpayer is an individual who acts as a copyrighter, holder of rights related to copyright, or owner of industrial property rights and receives remuneration for any of these rights.
The tax base is the difference between gross revenue and cost incurred by the taxpayer in generating and preserving the income. Standard costs are used to reduce taxable base, and are equal to 50%, 43%, and 34% of the gross income, depending of the type of royalty.
The tax rate applicable to royalty income is 20% after deduction of standard cost.
## Other income
Income subject to tax as other income includes income from leasing of equipment, transport devices, and other movable property, winnings from games of chance, income from personal insurance, income from athletes and sport experts, income from provision of hospitality services, and all other income that doesn’t fall into these categories.
In addition to the above-mentioned, other income also includes:
The tax rate applicable to other income is 20%, except for insurance, where the applicable tax rate is 15%.
## Exempt income
Certain types of income are exempt from the PIT (e.g. social welfare, pension).
The following employee benefits are tax exempt:
Employees are exempt from paying PIT where they have acquired shares in the company they work for either free of charge or at a discounted price, except where securities are considered to be taxable income due to:
In certain cases, non-residents working for diplomatic and consular missions or international organisations in Serbia are not taxed on their remuneration.
