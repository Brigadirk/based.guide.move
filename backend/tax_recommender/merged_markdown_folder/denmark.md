## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The Danish social security system is financed primarily through ordinary tax revenue and only very limited social security contributions for employees and employers.
All individuals working in Denmark and fully tax liable to Denmark and who are covered by Danish social security must also pay labour market supplementary pension (ATP).
Danish social security contributions and in some cases foreign social security contributions are deductible from personal income for tax purposes. The employer is responsible for withholding and paying the contributions on behalf of their employees.
| Social security annual rates (2025) | DKK |
| --- | --- |
| Employee: |  |
| ATP | 1,188 |
| Employer: |  |
| ATP | 2,376 |
| Contribution to maternity fund, estimated | 1,500 |
| Industrial injuries insurance, estimated \* | 5,000 |
| Other public social security schemes, partly estimated | 5,300 |
\* Please be informed that the estimated industrial injuries insurance may vary, depending on the field of work that the insured employee is employed within, the number of employees that the employer intends to insure, the specific insurance company, etc.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The Danish VAT rate is 25%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
From 1997, the wealth tax has been abolished. However, individuals must still fill out asset declarations as to foreign pension schemes and certain investments.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance left by a Danish resident is, in general, subject to Danish estate tax regardless of the country of residence of the beneficiary. Inheritance received by a Danish resident from an individual who was not resident in Denmark prior to death is not subject to Danish estate tax except if the inheritance consists of property located in Denmark or of assets related to a PE in Denmark. However, if an estate is settled before a Danish court, the entire inheritance will become taxable in Denmark, regardless of the country of residence of the deceased and the heirs. Estate tax amounts to 15% and is levied on the part of the assets that falls to the deceased’s children and descendants, stepchildren and their descendants, parents, or cohabitant during the last two years of one’s life. Inheritance and insurance payments that fall to the deceased’s spouse are exempt from estate tax. Inheritance received by any other relatives than the above-mentioned is subject to a supplementary estate tax of 25% of the value of the asset after deduction of the first 15%. The taxes are not levied on the first DKK 346,000 (in 2025) of the estate.
Gifts and donations not exceeding DKK 76,900 (in 2025) to the donor’s descendants are tax exempt. Gifts to the descendant’s spouses may not exceed DKK 26,900 (in 2025) to be tax exempt. Gifts and donations to the donor’s offspring and their descendants in excess of DKK 76,900 are levied with a gift tax amounting to 15%, and gifts to the donor’s stepparents and grand stepparents are levied with a gift tax of 36.25%. Gifts or inheritance between unrelated individuals are taxable as ordinary income if the recipient is fully tax liable to Denmark. A gift is not deductible for the donor.
## Property taxes
### Property value tax
Property owners are obligated to pay property value tax. Property value tax annually amounts to 0.51% of the value of a property up to DKK 9,200,000 and 1.4% of the value exceeding DKK 9,200,000.
Property value tax is charged on both Danish properties and properties situated in another country. Properties that are rented out are not subject to property value tax, regardless of where the property is situated. Instead, the net profit from the rental business is taxable.
### Property and land taxes
As a property owner, one is liable to pay two types of property tax: property tax and land tax. Property taxes are calculated as a percentage (tax rate) of the latest public property assessment. However, before the taxes are calculated, a deduction of 20% is granted. A so-called precautionary principle has been adopted, which considers the uncertainty that will always be presented when a property is assessed.
The land tax is paid through your preliminary income assessment and your tax assessment notice.
## Luxury and excise taxes
In Denmark, numerous excise taxes and duties apply on goods (e.g. light balls, sugar, liquor, tobacco). The taxes/duties are indirectly paid by the consumer through the prices of the goods and are thereby withheld and paid to the authorities by the entity selling the goods. A number of these taxes are expected to be reduced or abolished in the coming years.
## Stamp taxes
In general, stamp duty primarily occurs in connection with registration of rights regarding property and land.
Furthermore, insurance documents are liable to stamp duty if the risk is situated in Denmark.
## Taxes/duties regarding cars
When a motor vehicle is registered in Denmark for the first time, a registration duty must be paid. The motor vehicle cannot get a license plate before the duty has been paid.
The rates in 2025 for passenger cars are 25% of the value up to DKK 72,900, 85% of the value from DKK 72,900 up to DKK 226,500, and 150% of the value in excess.
If the stay in Denmark is anticipated to be temporary, other rules may be applied.
There is also an environmental addition to the taxable value of company cars. The addition consists of the annual motor vehicle tax, which is a quarterly fixed tax to be paid on all cars. The environmental addition provides a further incentive for the employee to choose a fuel-efficient company car, as the motor vehicle tax is based on the car’s fuel consumption.
## Custom duties
Goods for private use can be imported duty-free to Denmark from another European Union (EU) country. Denmark complies with the EU guidelines regarding the amounts of cigarettes, liquor, wine, and beer to be looked upon as serving private use.
Furthermore, import of personal possessions when arriving from a non-EU country may be exempted from customs duties, excises, and VAT, provided a number of conditions are fulfilled.
According to the rules in the Danish Customs Act, an individual is obligated to inform the tax authorities if Denmark is entered or left with cash amounts, traveller’s cheques, or the like with a value exceeding 10,000 euros (EUR).
The Danish tax authorities must also be notified of foreign bank accounts and deposits. Information on foreign life, pension schemes, and investments must also be submitted. Special forms must be filed.
## Tax regarding growth of a pension scheme (PAL tax)
In Denmark, individuals are taxed of the growth of their pension schemes. The tax rate is fixed at 15.3%. It is possible for individuals moving abroad to apply for exemption from this tax.
PAL tax is collected by the insurance company or pension fund, etc. that is obligated to withhold and pay the tax on behalf of the owner of the plan.
## Exit tax
Exit taxation applies for individuals who have been considered as resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark, who are leaving Denmark with assets, including but not limited to shares, options, bonds, certain pension plans, certain property investments, etc.
In case an individual's ties to another country during one's time in Denmark has been to a country with which Denmark does not have a DTT, then the exit tax rules may apply if the individual has been considered resident in Denmark according to internal Danish rules.
Specific exit tax rules apply for each type of asset. However, exit tax for individuals leaving with shares, bonds, claims, and financial contracts only applies if the individual has been subject to full Danish taxation (resident or resident and tax treaty resident) for at least seven out of the past ten years at the date of departure (date on which resident taxation ceases).
The rules apply to both Danish and foreign assets, shares, investment funds, financial contracts, deposit accounts, etc.
If comprised by the exit tax rules, the assets, etc. comprised will be considered as realised on the date of departure, and the individual will be liable to pay the Danish tax due on this unrealised gain (this is so-called exit tax, '*fraflytterskat*' in Danish). It may be possible to file for postponement of payment of the exit tax, provided a number of conditions are met and recurring obligations fulfilled. The possible postponement agreement will be different depending on the assets/investment type in question.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## WHTs on payments to foreign corporations and non-resident aliens
### Dividends
Dividends paid to a parent company in another EU member state or a state with which Denmark has a DTT are exempt from WHT, provided that the shares qualify as subsidiary shares (and the taxation should be reduced or eliminated according to the DTT or EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive). This implies that the parent company must be able to claim benefits under the applicable DTT or the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive. The same applies for dividends paid on group shares (that are not also subsidiary shares, i.e. holdings below 10%), provided that the recipient company is resident within the EU/EEA. It is a requirement for entitlement to benefits under the DTT or EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive that the recipient company is the beneficial owner of the dividend.
Further, a dividend may not be exempt from WHT if the dividend is a redistribution of tax-exempt dividends that the Danish company has received from a foreign subsidiary where the Danish company cannot be regarded as the beneficial owner.
As of 1 July 2016, the tax rate on dividends distributed from a Danish company to foreign corporate shareholders is 22%. It should be noted that the WHT rate has not been reduced but remains at 27%. The shareholders must reclaim the difference between the higher WHT rate (27%) and the lower tax rate (e.g. 5% if the lower tax rate is 22%). Specific transitional rules apply.
If the portfolio shareholder (shareholding below 10%) is situated in a country with which Denmark has a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA), the tax rate on the dividend is reduced to, e.g., 15%, and the difference between the higher WHT rate (27%) and the lower WHT rate may be reclaimed. However, the reduced rate does not apply if the shareholder is resident outside the European Union and together with related entities owns more than 10% of the capital in the Danish distributing company.
### Interest
Interest is generally not subject to WHT unless paid to a foreign group member company that is tax resident outside the European Union and outside any of the states with which Denmark has concluded a tax treaty. In this situation, interest WHT is levied at 22%. Certain other exemptions apply, mainly relating to CFC taxation.
For recipients resident in countries within the European Union with which Denmark does not have a tax treaty, it is a condition that the paying company and the recipient company are associated as defined in the EU Interest/Royalty Directive.
Furthermore, it is a requirement for WHT exemption that the recipient of the inter-company interest payment is able to claim benefits under the applicable DTT or the EU Interest/Royalty Directive. It is a requirement for entitlement to benefits under the DTT or EU Interest/Royalty Directive that the recipient company is the beneficial owner of the interest income.
### Royalties
Royalties are subject to a 22% WHT. In most cases, the WHT rate can be reduced in accordance with the tax treaty applicable. Also, the EU Interest/Royalty Directive may provide an exemption from WHT if the paying company and the recipient company are associated as defined in the EU Interest/Royalty Directive.
It is a requirement for WHT exemption that the recipient of the royalty payment is able to claim benefits under the applicable DTT or the EU Interest/Royalty Directive. Furthermore, it is a requirement for entitlement to benefits under the DTT or EU Interest/Royalty Directive that the recipient company is the beneficial owner of the royalty income.

Notes
1. Denmark does not operate a system of WHT on dividends when the parent company holds:
1. at least 10% of the share capital of the distributing Danish company, provided the receiving company is resident in a EU/EEA member state or a state with which Denmark has entered into an agreement on exchange of information, and that the parent company is subject to tax without exemption in that state (subsidiary shares), and that Denmark is obligated to reduce or waive taxation according to the Parent/Subsidiary Directive or a DTT, or
2. less than 10% of the share capital in the distributing company, provided the receiving company is an EU/EEA-resident, the distributing and the receiving company are affiliated companies (group shares), and that Denmark would have been obligated to reduce or waive taxation according to the Parent/Subsidiary Directive or a DTT.
2. Interest is generally not subject to WHT unless paid to a foreign group member company that is tax resident outside of the European Union and outside of any of the states with which Denmark has concluded a tax treaty. In this situation, interest WHT is levied at 22% for interest accrued or paid on 1 March 2015 or later (25% for interest that is accrued or paid before 1 March 2015), subject to reduction to the WHT rate stated in an applicable tax treaty (not reflected in the above overview).
3. Exemptions apply if the receiving company is directly or indirectly controlled by a Danish parent company or if the receiving company is controlled by a company resident in a state with which Denmark has a double tax convention and that company may be subject to CFC taxation. Finally, an exemption applies if the receiving company establishes that the foreign taxation of interest is not less than three-quarters of the Danish corporate taxation and that the interest is not paid to another foreign company subject to taxation that is less than three-quarters of the Danish corporate taxation.
4. Denmark has terminated its treaty with Spain with effect from 1 January 2009. The termination means that each country will tax the relevant income according to its domestic tax rules. New treaties are not expected to be agreed in the near future. Companies in Spain receiving dividends, interest, or royalty payments from a Danish company may (depending on the specific circumstances) qualify for tax exemption on these types of income due to the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive and the EU Interest and Royalties Directive. This qualification is grounded in the membership of both Denmark and Spain as EU member states.
5. The EU Interest/Royalty Directive may provide an exemption from WHT if the payee is an immediate parent, sister, or subsidiary company resident in the European Union.
6. Serbia has succeeded in the treaty between Denmark and Yugoslavia.
7. Different rates apply depending on the characteristics of the assets on which royalty is paid.
9. The WHT rate is 25% for interest and royalties that are accrued or paid before 1 March 2015.
10. As of 1 July 2016, the tax rate on dividends distributed from a Danish company to foreign corporate shareholders is 22%. For dividends distributed from Danish companies to shareholders situated in the EU/EEA, the tax rate has been reduced retrospectively and applies to dividends distributed on 1 January 2007 or later. For the income years 2007 to 2013, the applicable tax rate is 25%; for the income year 2014, it is 24.5%; and for the income year 2015, it is 23.5%. It should be noted that the WHT rate has not been reduced but remains 27%. The shareholders must reclaim the difference between the higher WHT rate and the lower tax rate. Specific transitional rules apply. If the portfolio shareholder is situated in a country with which Denmark has a TIEA, the tax rate on the dividend is reduced to 15% and the difference between the higher WHT rate and the lower WHT rate may be reclaimed. However, the reduced rate does not apply if the shareholder is resident outside the European Union and together with related entities owns more than 10% of the capital in the Danish distributing company.
11. According to the tax treaty with Azerbaijan, it is a requirement for the 5% WHT rate to apply on dividend payments that the parent company holds at least 20% of the shares in the subsidiary, and that the investment in the subsidiary amounts to EUR 1 million (or a corresponding amount in a different currency). With respect to royalties, the reduced WHT rates apply if the royalty is payment for the use of a patent (licence), design, secret formula, etc., or information about industrial, commercial, or scientific experiences.
12. The 5% WHT rate applies if the parent company holds at least 10% of the shares in the subsidiary, or if the parent company is an institutional investor (specific types of institutional investors are mentioned in the treaty). In any other case, the 15% WHT rate applies.
13. According to the tax treaty with Armenia, it is a requirement for:
1. The 0% WHT rate to apply on dividend payments that the beneficial owner (a company) holds at least 50% of the shares in the subsidiary, and that the investment in the subsidiary amounts to EUR 2 million (or corresponding amount in Danish or Armenian currency) in the subsidiary who distribute the dividend.
2. The 5% WHT rate to apply on dividend payments that the beneficial owner (a company) holds at least 10% of the shares in the distributing company, and that the investment in the company amounts to EUR 100,000 (or corresponding amount in Danish or Armenian currency) in the subsidiary who distribute the dividend.
14. Denmark has ratified the treaty. Algeria has not yet ratified the treaty. If Algeria ratifies the treaty during 2024, the treaty could take effect from 1 January 2025.
## Increase in tax rates and WHT rates on dividends distributed to recipients in countries and territories on the EU blacklist of tax havens
Persons and companies, etc. who are tax resident in one of the countries and territories on the EU blacklist of tax havens, and who are subject to limited tax liability on dividends, etc. of major shareholder shares, subsidiary shares, or group company shares, must pay a final gross tax of 44% of such dividends if the person or company in question is the beneficial owner of the dividends.
The blacklist currently includes the following countries and territories:
The measures came into effect 1 July 2024.
The obligation for a dividend-paying company to withhold a 44% WHT on dividends on major shareholders’ shares, subsidiary shares, and group company shares will apply in all cases where:
This rule will not apply (but the general rules on WHT on dividends would be applicable) if it is demonstrated that the beneficial owner of the dividend is tax resident in an EU or EEA member state or in a country that has entered into a DTT with Denmark. This will include cases where a legal entity is registered in one of the countries covered by the EU blacklist of tax havens, but is tax resident in an EU or EEA member state or in a country that has a DTT with Denmark. In addition, it will cover cases where a dividend is received by a shareholder resident in one of the EU blacklisted countries but transferred to a physical or a legal person who is the beneficial owner of the dividend and who is tax resident in an EU or EEA member state or in a country that has entered into a DTT with Denmark.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Taxable income is generally calculated as income determined for accounting purposes that is adjusted and modified for several items, as prescribed by the tax laws. Typical timing differences include reserves, work in progress, deprecations, and certain non-deductible cost items.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at acquisition cost, current market value, or manufacturing cost (if manufactured by the company itself) according to a first in first out (FIFO) principle. The company may opt for different principles for each category of goods and may change principle from income year to income year, provided certain conditions are met.
## Capital gains
Gains and losses realised on the sale of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally included in taxable income.
### Sales of shares
Gains realised on the sale of shares are tax-exempt if the shares qualify as either ‘subsidiary shares’, ‘group shares’, or 'tax-exempt portfolio shares'.
‘Subsidiary shares’ are defined as shares held by a corporate shareholder that holds a minimum of 10% of the share capital. With respect to a foreign subsidiary, it is a condition that the foreign subsidiary must be subject to CIT in its domicile state and the applicable CIT rate cannot be 0% or almost 0%. Furthermore, Denmark must hold an agreement to exchange tax information with the domicile state of the subsidiary. Such agreement must be in force at the time of distribution of dividends, etc.
‘Group shares’ are defined as shares in companies with which the shareholder is jointly taxed or could be jointly taxed. The definition of a group is therefore the same as in the joint taxation rules and generally corresponds to the definition of a group for accounting purposes. The location where the companies are registered is irrelevant, as long as the companies are affiliated.
If the shares do not constitute group shares, subsidiary shares, or treasury shares, they constitute portfolio shares. Portfolio shares are divided into two types: tax-exempt portfolio shares and taxable portfolio shares.
‘Tax-exempt portfolio shares' consist of shareholdings less than 10% in unlisted companies.
The residual constitutes taxable portfolio shares unless held by the company that has issued the shares (gains on 'treasury shares' are also tax exempt).
Gains on taxable portfolio shares are fully taxable regardless of holding period, whereas losses on the sale of taxable portfolio shares are generally tax-deductible.
### Sales of real estate property
Gains realised on the sale of real estate property are taxable. A loss realised on the sale of land and other buildings may be utilised only against taxable profits on the sale of real estate properties in the same year or may be carried forward indefinitely.
A capital gain may, under certain conditions, be deferred if the capital gain is reinvested in properties. Reinvestment must be made no later than the income years following the income year of disposal.
### Receivables
For receivables, capital gains are, in general, taxable and losses are, in general, tax deductible. However, capital losses related to intra-group receivables are non-deductible for companies, and, correspondingly, capital gains on debt are not taxable for the debtor.
Capital gains and capital losses on receivables should be included in the taxable income using the mark-to-market principles. However, if the receivable relates to an inter-company receivable or a trade receivable, the realisation principle applies, but the company can choose to apply the mark-to-market principles on exchange rate changes and/or the receivable itself.
### Debt
As a general rule, capital gains and capital losses on debt should be included in the taxable income using the realisation principle. However, the mark-to-market principle can be applied for unlisted debt in foreign currency, for exchange rate changes, and/or the debt itself if the debt is listed.
Special rules apply in relation to compositions, remission of debt, and conversion of debt. Special rules also apply for financial activities.
### Financial instruments
Gains and losses on financial instruments are generally included in taxable income, according to the mark-to-market principle, which is required. In certain cases, losses and gains are calculated according to the separation principle: regardless of which underlying asset the contract is based on, calculation of gains and losses follows the rules that apply to the underlying asset. Special rules apply for losses on certain share-based contracts.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Danish parent company on ‘subsidiary shares’ (>10% ownership), and ‘group shares’ (>50% ownership), or ‘unlisted portfolio shares’ (<10% ownership) are tax exempt, regardless of the length of the ownership period, provided recipient is beneficial owner of the dividend. Further conditions may apply if the recipient is a non-Danish company
Dividends received on listed portfolio shares, which are neither subsidiary or group shares, are fully included in taxable income and subject to a 22% tax rate.
Regardless of whether the shares qualify as ‘subsidiary shares’ or ‘group shares’ or ‘unlisted portfolio shares’, dividends are fully taxable if received from a foreign company that can deduct the dividends paid in their taxable income.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends may be distributed to shareholders free of tax, provided that the dividends are in proportion to the existing shareholdings.
### Broadened anti-avoidance rule regarding dividends
A technical amendment to a specific anti-avoidance rule will prevent group companies that are internally reorganising from artificially disguising (taxable) dividends as capital gains. The new rules may have an impact on certain corporate transactions.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally included in the determination of taxable income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is generally included in the determination of taxable income.
## Foreign income
As a general rule, foreign-sourced income, such as interest and royalty, is included in taxable income. However, income from a PE or real estate outside Denmark is, as a general rule, excluded from taxable income due to the principal of territoriality.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Taxable period
Danish corporate taxpayers are taxed on an annual basis. Corporate taxpayers may choose a tax year that is different from the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are completed on the basis of financial accounts with adjustments for tax. Tax returns should be filed no later than six months following the end of the accounting year. Corporations with an accounting year-end that falls in the period from 1 March to 31 March must file a tax return no later than 1 September in the same calendar year.
Tax returns must be filed digitally. Companies can file the tax return themselves or grant their auditor/tax advisors access to file the tax return on their behalf.
The tax system, in practice, is based on self-assessment. Tax assessments are made automatically by the tax authorities on the basis of the tax return. However, the tax authorities may subsequently audit the tax return.
## Payment of tax
CIT must be paid on a current-year basis in two equal instalments due on 20 March and 20 November. The authorities request payments of 50% of the average of the last three years’ final income tax. In addition, voluntary additional payments may be made on the same dates. Companies may make a voluntary additional payment no later than 1 February following the assessment year (i.e. no later than 1 February 2024 for the tax year 2023 and no later than 1 February 2025 for the tax year 2024).
Voluntary advance tax payments made no later than 20 March, the company is granted an addition of 1.1% (2024), while voluntary advance tax payments made no later than 20 November are imposed a surcharge of 1.1% (2024). Additional voluntary advance tax payments made after 20 November but no later than 1 February in the year following the income year are imposed a surcharge of 1.6% (2024).
In case of voluntary and ordinary advance tax payments made no later than 20 November exceeding the final tax bill an allowance of 4.4% (2024) is granted on the overpaid amount. In case of the final tax bill exceeding advance tax payments a surtax of 8.3% (2024) is charged on an amount reflecting the difference between the advance tax payments and final tax bill.
The final tax bill is settled on 20 November in the year following the income year. Underpaid tax, incl. the surtax of 8.3% (2024) is then payable, and overpaid tax, incl. the allowance of 4.4% (2024), is refunded.
The allowance percentage, surcharge percentages, and surtax percentage, are published by the Danish Tax Authorities no later than 15 December of the income year.
## Tax audit process
The Danish tax system is based on self-assessment. Companies are, in general, subject to audit on a random basis, but some large companies/groups are subject to annual audit by the Danish tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The general statute of limitations is 1 May in the fourth calendar year after that of the end of the relevant accounting period. The deadline concerns the tax administration’s notification of making or changing an assessment of income tax. This limitation is extended for another two years with respect to inter-company (transfer pricing) issues and certain tax-exempt restructurings.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The Danish social security system is financed primarily through ordinary tax revenue and only very limited social security contributions for employees and employers.
All individuals working in Denmark and fully tax liable to Denmark and who are covered by Danish social security must also pay labour market supplementary pension (ATP).
Danish social security contributions and in some cases foreign social security contributions are deductible from personal income for tax purposes. The employer is responsible for withholding and paying the contributions on behalf of their employees.
| Social security annual rates (2025) | DKK |
| --- | --- |
| Employee: |  |
| ATP | 1,188 |
| Employer: |  |
| ATP | 2,376 |
| Contribution to maternity fund, estimated | 1,500 |
| Industrial injuries insurance, estimated \* | 5,000 |
| Other public social security schemes, partly estimated | 5,300 |
\* Please be informed that the estimated industrial injuries insurance may vary, depending on the field of work that the insured employee is employed within, the number of employees that the employer intends to insure, the specific insurance company, etc.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The Danish VAT rate is 25%.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
From 1997, the wealth tax has been abolished. However, individuals must still fill out asset declarations as to foreign pension schemes and certain investments.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance left by a Danish resident is, in general, subject to Danish estate tax regardless of the country of residence of the beneficiary. Inheritance received by a Danish resident from an individual who was not resident in Denmark prior to death is not subject to Danish estate tax except if the inheritance consists of property located in Denmark or of assets related to a PE in Denmark. However, if an estate is settled before a Danish court, the entire inheritance will become taxable in Denmark, regardless of the country of residence of the deceased and the heirs. Estate tax amounts to 15% and is levied on the part of the assets that falls to the deceased’s children and descendants, stepchildren and their descendants, parents, or cohabitant during the last two years of one’s life. Inheritance and insurance payments that fall to the deceased’s spouse are exempt from estate tax. Inheritance received by any other relatives than the above-mentioned is subject to a supplementary estate tax of 25% of the value of the asset after deduction of the first 15%. The taxes are not levied on the first DKK 346,000 (in 2025) of the estate.
Gifts and donations not exceeding DKK 76,900 (in 2025) to the donor’s descendants are tax exempt. Gifts to the descendant’s spouses may not exceed DKK 26,900 (in 2025) to be tax exempt. Gifts and donations to the donor’s offspring and their descendants in excess of DKK 76,900 are levied with a gift tax amounting to 15%, and gifts to the donor’s stepparents and grand stepparents are levied with a gift tax of 36.25%. Gifts or inheritance between unrelated individuals are taxable as ordinary income if the recipient is fully tax liable to Denmark. A gift is not deductible for the donor.
## Property taxes
### Property value tax
Property owners are obligated to pay property value tax. Property value tax annually amounts to 0.51% of the value of a property up to DKK 9,200,000 and 1.4% of the value exceeding DKK 9,200,000.
Property value tax is charged on both Danish properties and properties situated in another country. Properties that are rented out are not subject to property value tax, regardless of where the property is situated. Instead, the net profit from the rental business is taxable.
### Property and land taxes
As a property owner, one is liable to pay two types of property tax: property tax and land tax. Property taxes are calculated as a percentage (tax rate) of the latest public property assessment. However, before the taxes are calculated, a deduction of 20% is granted. A so-called precautionary principle has been adopted, which considers the uncertainty that will always be presented when a property is assessed.
The land tax is paid through your preliminary income assessment and your tax assessment notice.
## Luxury and excise taxes
In Denmark, numerous excise taxes and duties apply on goods (e.g. light balls, sugar, liquor, tobacco). The taxes/duties are indirectly paid by the consumer through the prices of the goods and are thereby withheld and paid to the authorities by the entity selling the goods. A number of these taxes are expected to be reduced or abolished in the coming years.
## Stamp taxes
In general, stamp duty primarily occurs in connection with registration of rights regarding property and land.
Furthermore, insurance documents are liable to stamp duty if the risk is situated in Denmark.
## Taxes/duties regarding cars
When a motor vehicle is registered in Denmark for the first time, a registration duty must be paid. The motor vehicle cannot get a license plate before the duty has been paid.
The rates in 2025 for passenger cars are 25% of the value up to DKK 72,900, 85% of the value from DKK 72,900 up to DKK 226,500, and 150% of the value in excess.
If the stay in Denmark is anticipated to be temporary, other rules may be applied.
There is also an environmental addition to the taxable value of company cars. The addition consists of the annual motor vehicle tax, which is a quarterly fixed tax to be paid on all cars. The environmental addition provides a further incentive for the employee to choose a fuel-efficient company car, as the motor vehicle tax is based on the car’s fuel consumption.
## Custom duties
Goods for private use can be imported duty-free to Denmark from another European Union (EU) country. Denmark complies with the EU guidelines regarding the amounts of cigarettes, liquor, wine, and beer to be looked upon as serving private use.
Furthermore, import of personal possessions when arriving from a non-EU country may be exempted from customs duties, excises, and VAT, provided a number of conditions are fulfilled.
According to the rules in the Danish Customs Act, an individual is obligated to inform the tax authorities if Denmark is entered or left with cash amounts, traveller’s cheques, or the like with a value exceeding 10,000 euros (EUR).
The Danish tax authorities must also be notified of foreign bank accounts and deposits. Information on foreign life, pension schemes, and investments must also be submitted. Special forms must be filed.
## Tax regarding growth of a pension scheme (PAL tax)
In Denmark, individuals are taxed of the growth of their pension schemes. The tax rate is fixed at 15.3%. It is possible for individuals moving abroad to apply for exemption from this tax.
PAL tax is collected by the insurance company or pension fund, etc. that is obligated to withhold and pay the tax on behalf of the owner of the plan.
## Exit tax
Exit taxation applies for individuals who have been considered as resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark, who are leaving Denmark with assets, including but not limited to shares, options, bonds, certain pension plans, certain property investments, etc.
In case an individual's ties to another country during one's time in Denmark has been to a country with which Denmark does not have a DTT, then the exit tax rules may apply if the individual has been considered resident in Denmark according to internal Danish rules.
Specific exit tax rules apply for each type of asset. However, exit tax for individuals leaving with shares, bonds, claims, and financial contracts only applies if the individual has been subject to full Danish taxation (resident or resident and tax treaty resident) for at least seven out of the past ten years at the date of departure (date on which resident taxation ceases).
The rules apply to both Danish and foreign assets, shares, investment funds, financial contracts, deposit accounts, etc.
If comprised by the exit tax rules, the assets, etc. comprised will be considered as realised on the date of departure, and the individual will be liable to pay the Danish tax due on this unrealised gain (this is so-called exit tax, '*fraflytterskat*' in Danish). It may be possible to file for postponement of payment of the exit tax, provided a number of conditions are met and recurring obligations fulfilled. The possible postponement agreement will be different depending on the assets/investment type in question.

# Denmark
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The general VAT rate is 25% of the price charged (exclusive of VAT).
While certain supplies are subject to VAT exemptions, such as hospital treatment; insurance and reinsurance services; most financial activities, including deposits of money and granting of loans, it is crucial to emphasise a substantial distinction between VAT exempt transactions as per Section 13 and 'zero-rated' transactions under Section 34 in the Danish VAT Act. The aforementioned examples specifically illustrate Section 13 transactions, where the right to reclaim VAT is not applicable. Conversely, transactions falling under Section 34, e.g. intra-community supply of goods and services, allow for a full VAT deduction, highlighting a notable difference in the treatment of these two categories.
Denmark was one of the first countries to introduce a VAT system. Since then, the VAT legislation in Denmark has undergone several changes. The most important changes have been modifications to bring the legislation in line with the Sixth EC VAT Directive (which, since 1 January, 2007, is officially named the Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of Value Added Tax) and the so-called EU VAT Package that entered into force on 1 January, 2010.
The present Danish VAT Act (Momsloven) entered into force with effect from 1 July, 1994. Compared to the Directive, the Danish VAT legislation includes minor deviations and the use of various discretionary provisions.
All supplies of goods and services by so-called ‘taxable persons’ (entrepreneurs who independently carry out economic activities) are subject to VAT, unless specifically exempted. Although the VAT exemptions are restricted to a limited range of services and goods, they are subject to a considerable number of binding rulings and administrative guidance with respect to their interpretation and application.
Transactions are subject to Danish VAT only when they are deemed to take place in Denmark. For the sake of tax neutrality, VAT is also levied on (i) imports (i.e. receipt of goods from non-EU territories), (ii) intra-Community acquisitions (i.e. receipt of goods from EU member states), and (iii) purchases of most services from foreign suppliers.
In order to avoid VAT being borne by anyone other than the final consumer, those who qualify as taxable persons can, with some exceptions, recover VAT charged by their suppliers according to the invoice/credit method, provided that the purchases relate to VATable transactions. VAT is recovered either via the periodical VAT return (as a deduction in VAT payable) or by filing a special application.
As a main rule, it is the supplier’s responsibility to settle and report VAT on the supplies of goods and services in Denmark. However, a taxable customer/recipient is responsible for reporting VAT on the import or acquisition of goods from abroad as well as the purchase of most types of services from foreign suppliers.
## Special payroll tax (Lønsumsafgift)
Companies that provide VAT exempt services may be liable to pay special payroll tax (in Danish ‘lønsumsafgift’) in Denmark, which is calculated on the total payroll, including any type of wages and bonuses that the employee has received. There are four different calculation methods; which method should be applied depends on the activity and organisational structure. The method and percentage applied to calculate the special payroll tax depend on the ratio between VAT able and VAT exempt services supplied.
In case the VAT exempt financial revenue is more than 50% of the total revenue, the company will be qualified as a financial services provider and the special payroll tax is then 15.3% (for 2021 and subsequent years) of the payroll used for the VAT exempt activities.
This tax is deductible for income tax purposes.
## Customs duties
Denmark is a member state of the European Union, and, according to EU’s Common Customs Tariff, goods imported into Denmark from outside the European Union are subject to customs duties. The rates of duty vary widely between goods.
## Excise duties
According to Danish tax law, several excise duties are levied on different products. Some of the excise duties are enacted based on EU regulations while others are enacted according to domestic law only.
Excise duties are chargeable on a long list of goods, including (but not only) oil products, certain packaging, alcoholic drinks and tobacco, chocolate and sweets, coffee, etc.
The excise duty rates depend on the type of goods (e.g. chocolate, packaging) as well as, in some cases, the category of the goods (e.g. plastic bags, paper bags). Furthermore, many of the excise duty rates are regulated every year.
Only goods sold in Denmark (or taken into Denmark) are liable to the Danish excise duties. Companies taking goods into Denmark or companies producing goods in Denmark must be registered with the Danish tax authorities to settle the excise duties.
The type of registration is decisive for when the companies must pay the excise duties.
As excise duties are a tax for consumption in Denmark, a company can, in principle, obtain a reimbursement of the excise duties on products sold outside of Denmark. Companies are entitled to a reimbursement even if the company is not registered for the excise duties in question and even if the excise duties have been paid by previous resellers, etc.
## Property taxes
The Danish property tax system has recently been revised, so all property taxes for 2022 and onwards are preliminary, and any adjustment will be claimed backwards once the assessments are final. The finalisation of the property taxes is pending the publication of the final assessments, which is currently expected to be in 2025/26.
Owners of non-residential property must pay land tax annually. The land tax rate is set by the municipalities and is between 0.31% and 1.77% of the value of the land. Municipalities may also levy a special coverage charge on certain non-residential properties at a rate also set by the municipalities and is between 0.08% and 1.8% of the land value.
It is important to note that there are several transitional schemes in the new legislation, to ensure that neither private nor commercial individuals will receive greatly increased claims in the new system. However, making changes to the property could void these schemes and have a great impact on the property taxes.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is payable on a few documents, including deeds for the transfer of real estate, and mortgages associated with real estate and cooperative housing, chattels, and intangible assets, as well as property reservations in motor vehicles. There is no stamp duty on the transfer of shares.
The stamp tax is a fixed amount ranging from DKK 1,825 to DKK 1,850 (2025), accompanied by a predetermined percentage based on the fixed fee.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than employer’s tax (*see below*).
## Employer’s tax (social security charges)
The employer’s contribution to Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension (ATP) (i.e. old-age pension) charges is DKK 2,376 (2025) per annum for a full-time employee and DKK 1,188 (2025) for the employee part
Based on the ATP contribution, derived contributions will be due. Also, a mandatory Danish accidents at work insurance must be taken out. The total annual employer social security costs are approximately DKK 16,000 (2025) per full time employee depending on industry.
Employers that pay ATP contributions are also liable of making contributions to the Danish Labour Market Fund for Posted Workers, although this is not a social security contribution.
Companies that provide VAT-exempt services are liable to pay the employer’s tax, which is calculated on the total annual salary cost. The rate can be as high as 15.3%, which is the rate from 2018 and onwards for banks and other financial institutions, the most significant sector paying the employer’s tax. This tax is deductible for income tax purposes.
## Environmental taxes / Energy taxes
Danish companies must pay environmental taxes, which were introduced to reduce companies’ energy consumption, discharges of fluids with an environmental impact, and emission. These taxes are paid to the companies that provide the energy, who then pay the taxes to the Danish tax authorities. Most of the environmental tax rates are regulated every year.
In general, in 2024 almost all VAT-registered companies in Denmark could obtain a reimbursement of some of the environmental taxes on energy (also called energy taxes). The size of the reimbursement of the energy taxes depends on the type of energy used and to what extent the companies can deduct VAT.
From 1 January 2025 a new CO2 tax will come into effect. This tax represents a significant change to the Danish excise duty system and will affect the reimbursement of excise duties on energy.

# Denmark
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Taxable period
The Danish tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Provisional taxes are withheld or collected on the basis of an estimated income for the current year. Accordingly, a preliminary income assessment should be filed with the Danish Tax Authorities.
All individuals who are either subject to full or limited tax liability to Denmark are obligated to submit a tax return, including all necessary additional information regarding income, to the Danish Tax Authorities by 1 May or no later than 1 July in the year following the relevant income year. When the final tax return has been reported, the Danish Tax Authorities elaborate a final tax assessment that states whether the individual has an underpayment of tax, excess tax, or neither of the two.
Individuals leaving Denmark have to file a tax return at the normal deadline. Income in the year of departure must be pro-rated in the same way as in the year of arrival.
If an individual is liable to either full or limited tax liability only for part of the calendar year, their income will be annualised. The individual may apply for the use of their actual income during the calendar year instead of annualising the income.
## Reports and withholdings
In general, a reporting obligation is attached to almost any taxable payout. The reporting obligation lies with the authority, company, employer, bank, etc. that makes the payout. For certain kinds of payouts, such as salary, there is also an obligation for the employer to withhold the tax.
In connection with the payout of interests, the financial institution is responsible for reporting the payout but not for withholding the tax. This means that an underpayment of tax will occur for individuals who do not pay the tax immediately or have taken the payout into account in a preliminary tax return.
As for dividends, a tax of 27% must be withheld by the company distributing the dividend.
As for royalties, a withholding tax of 22% must be operated by the payer.
There are no specific withholding requirements regarding private individual’s profits from sales of private property. However, property value tax is part of the preliminary tax return and withheld this way.
Income from foreign sources must be reported in the final tax return by individuals who are tax treaty residents in Denmark.
## Payment of tax
Tax liabilities for a certain income year should be stated in a preliminary income assessment and in this way make it possible to pay taxes during the income year in question. When doing so, all known income and expenses must be taken into account.
Should unexpected income or expenses occur during an income year, the preliminary income assessment can be changed. Alternatively, it is possible to make a voluntary payment of tax.
Ownership of property in other countries than Denmark must also be reported.
When the final tax has been assessed during the year following the income year in question, an underpayment of tax or an excess tax may occur. As a starting point, any underpayment of tax up to an amount of DKK 24,000 (in 2025) will be carried forward to the income year that follows the year in which the tax assessment is made. Exceeding underpayment of tax will be collected in three instalments, with due dates on 1 August, 1 September, and 1 October in the year of the assessment.
Taxes are either withheld and paid at source, paid through giro payment forms, or as a bank transfer.
## Tax audit process
Tax administration in Denmark in general is handled by the Danish Tax Authorities.
The collection of taxes is based partly on the reporting from the taxpayer and partly on the compulsory reporting from employers, banks, and financial institutions, etc.
## Statute of limitations
In general, time frames and due dates are defined by law and regulations in Denmark. This means that, as a main rule, limitations regarding tax claims are set in three years after the due date.
The main rule on statute of limitations after three years can be suspended if the tax authorities were not aware of the claim or the debtor.
Criminal acts can be investigated beyond the three years.
Further, generally, there is an ultimate limit of ten years.
Compliance in general has a high focus, and dawn raids are used where combined efforts are used by tax authorities, immigration authorities, and other relevant authorities. There is an increased audit focus on cross-border work/transactions.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
An individual may be taxed in Denmark as having full tax liability to Denmark, as having limited tax liability to Denmark, or according to special expatriate rules or rules regarding work force hire.
Individuals who are residents in Denmark are subject to full tax liability (i.e. liable to tax on their worldwide income unless the individual is considered to be tax resident in another country according to a double taxation treaty [DTT]).
An individual who is fully tax resident in Denmark will, as a main rule, be taxed according to the ordinary tax scheme by up to 52.07% (55.90% including AM tax, which is also income tax for DTT purposes) in 2025. A number of deductions are applicable; consequently, the effective tax rate is lower in most cases.
An individual not fully tax liable may have limited tax liability to Denmark. Limited tax liability is restricted to income from Danish sources, listed in the Danish Tax at Source Act, Section 2, including:
An individual with limited tax liability to Denmark will, as a main rule, be taxed by up to 52.07% (55.90%, including AM tax) on income from sources in Denmark in 2025.
## Personal income tax rates
Generally, individuals are subject to national income tax, municipal tax, labour market tax, and church tax (*all described below*).
When assessing the tax under the ordinary scheme, the following types of income apply:
The different types of income are subject to different taxes and are consequently taxed with different rates. This also means that the value of a deduction differs depending on in which income the deduction can be made.
The tax rates are as follows:
| Taxes (2025) | Income basis | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State taxes: |  |  |
| Bottom tax | Personal income | 12.01 |
| Local taxes: |  |  |
| Municipal tax (average) | Taxable income | 25.068 |
| Labour market tax | Personal income | 8.00 |
| Share tax: |  |  |
| 0 to 67,500 Danish kroner (DKK) | Share income | 27.00 |
| More than DKK 67,500 | Share income | 42.00 |
Note that tax bands and local taxes may be adjusted annually.
Altogether, the marginal tax rate cannot exceed 52.07% (2025). However, labour market tax, share tax, property value tax, and church tax are not comprised by this rule.
Net capital income is taxed at a rate up to 42% (in 2025). Negative net capital income and other allowances may be deducted but not with full effect.
## National taxes
### Bottom tax
The bottom tax base is represented by the personal income plus positive net capital income. Bottom tax implies a taxation of 12.01% (2025).
## Local taxes
### Municipal tax
Local income tax (municipal tax) is calculated on taxable income at a flat rate dependent on the municipality in question. The country average is 25.068% (2025).
## Labour market tax
Labour market tax amounts to 8% of the personal income.
## Share tax
Share income up to DKK 67,500 (2025) (DKK 135,000 for a married couple) is taxed at 27%. Share income in excess of this amount is taxed at 42%.
## Church tax
Church tax is imposed at a flat rate dependent on the municipality in question. The country average for church taxpayers is approximately 0.64% (2025). Church tax is imposed by municipalities and is only charged for members of the Danish State Church (Lutheran). When registering in Denmark, all individuals should explicitly state if they should not be comprised.
## Other income taxes
### Special expatriate scheme
As the labour market tax also applies, the combined tax rate is 32.84% each year during the 84-month period.
### Work force hire scheme
Note that there is particular focus from the tax authorities on the work force hires rules and compliance in general.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Companies are subject to tax on all income and are only allowed deductions on expenses that are related to the operations of the company.
According to Danish tax law, a territoriality principle prevails with respect to PEs and real estate located abroad. Hence, a Danish company is not taxed on its worldwide income. Instead, income from a PE outside Denmark or from real estate located abroad is excluded from taxable income. Non-resident companies are taxed only on profits from income sourced in Denmark. The CIT rate is 22%.
## Hydrocarbon income tax
The ordinary CIT rate of 22% does not apply to Danish oil and gas upstream activities. Instead, there are two ‘ring fenced’ taxes on Danish oil and gas upstream activities. One very similar to the ordinary CIT; however, the tax rate is 25% instead of 22% and the income is ring fenced (i.e. no tax losses from other income can be deducted in income from the Danish oil and gas upstream activities). In addition to the 25% tax, a special income tax, labelled ‘hydrocarbon tax’, is levied on profits from the exploration and extraction of oil and gas on the Danish continental shelf at a rate of 52%. The 25% tax is deductible in computing the hydrocarbon tax, resulting in an effective tax rate of 64%.
Annual tax depreciation of platforms, wells, and inter-platform installations is allowed with up to 15% on a declining balance. Pipelines and other infrastructure assets can be depreciated with up to 7%.
Exploration costs can either be expensed or capitalised for tax purposes. If capitalised, the costs shall be amortised over five years with 20% annually from the year of first oil.
The following assets, which are subject to the special hydrocarbon tax (52%), qualify for an uplift of 5% in six years (30% in total):
No uplift is granted under Chapter 2 (25%).
### Temporary tax incentive regime
A voluntary and temporary tax incentive regime for oil and gas companies has been adopted (Chapter 3B).
The regime increases depreciation of production assets subject to hydrocarbon tax to 20% and uplift to 6.5% in six years (39% in total). Furthermore, it advances depreciation, as well as uplift, to time of payment. No accelerated depreciation/uplift applies to Chapter 2.
Chapter 3B is applicable to investments submitted for approval during the 'investment window' from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2025 and finally approved by the Danish Energy Agency and completed no later than 31 December 2026. A decision to enter into the 3B regime should be made when filing the tax return for the first year the regime shall apply.
If the average annual oil price increases to 75 United States dollars (USD)/USD 85 per barrel, from 2022 a 5%/10% surtax will apply to income from upstream oil and gas production before interest and tax (Chapter 2) capped to 20.1% of capital expenditure investments made during the investment window. The surtax is deductible in the hydrocarbon tax. Any repayment obligation expires in 2037.
### Related activities
Activity connected to the prospecting, exploration, or exploitation of oil and gas is taxed at 22%; however, it is taxable under a more aggressive regime than non-oil/gas activity. Any activity connected to oil and gas (e.g. drilling, seismic surveying, oilfield services) is taxable, regardless of whether a PE exists or not. This may be tempered by provisions in applicable DTTs.
## Tonnage Tax Scheme
#### **Application of the Tonnage Tax Scheme**
Danish tax law provides for a special tax scheme for shipping entities.
The main principle of the Tonnage Tax Scheme is that qualifying shipping entities are not taxed on the basis of their actual income derived from their business but on a fictitious income based on the net tons (NT) carrying capability of their fleet used for purposes covered by the Tonnage Tax Act.
The Tonnage Tax Scheme is available to:
A decision to enter into the scheme should be made in the first income year where the entity qualifies for the Tonnage Tax Scheme, and the decision is binding for a period of ten years.
As a general rule, group-related shipping companies based in Denmark must make the same choice regarding the Tonnage Tax Scheme. However, shipping companies that do not have the same management or operating organisation and do not conduct business in related fields may be exempt from the joint decision provision.
Income from gross tonnage leased out on a bareboat basis exceeding 50% of the total gross tonnage is taxed under the general rules of Danish tax legislation. The assessment as to whether the condition is fulfilled is made at group level, and the calculation of leased out gross tonnage therefore does not include bareboat leasing between group companies domiciled in an EU/European Economic Area (EEA) country.
That the management of the company can be conducted from abroad to a certain extent, the seafarers can be foreigners, and the vessels can be strategically and commercially managed from EU/EEA, if the place of effective management is still in Denmark to the effect that the entity is considered tax resident here. A principle of scale is used in the assessment and on a case-by-case basis.
Ships on time-charter contracts without call/buy options can only be included in the tonnage tax scheme with a gross tonnage amount equivalent to 4 times the total gross tonnage of 1) owned tonnage, 2) tonnage on bareboat terms, and 3) tonnage on a 1-7 year time-charter when a purchase option is agreed upon at the same time as the time charter agreement is concluded, whereby the charterer has the option to purchase the ship at the latest at the expiry of the time charter contract, at maximum the market price. The Danish Tax Agency has a strict practice in terms of whether a time chartered vessel with purchase option fulfills the conditions to qualify as own tonnage.  If the 1:4 ratio between own and chartered tonnage is not met, taxation of gross earnings under the general rules of Danish tax legislation only takes place if the total gross earnings are positive. Similarly, the income subject to tonnage taxation under the fixed rates based on NT, cf. taxable income below, will be reduced.
During the income year, shipping companies, which have elected to use the tonnage tax system, must on average maintain or increase the percentage of owned gross tonnage registered in an EU/EEC registry. This does not apply if, the average EU/EEC registered tonnage of all the shipping companies using the Danish tonnage tax system has not been decreased, or
the average EU/EEC gross tonnage of the specific shipping company is at least 60%. The baseline for measuring the level of EU/EEC flagged ships is the level that the shipping company had, when it first entered the tonnage tax system. If the flag rule is not met, taxation of gross earnings under the general rules of Danish tax legislation only takes place if the total gross earnings are positive. Similarly, the income subject to tonnage taxation under the fixed rates based on NT, cf. taxable income below, will be reduced. will be reduced.
Turnover from activities that are carried out in close connection with this business 'ancillary income', such as the usage of containers and loading facilities, rental of shop space on board, etc., may only be included in the Tonnage Tax Scheme if they account for less than 50% of the total turnover from business. The turnover includes income from the sale of vessels (which was actually made tax-exempt in 2007 for vessels acquired after 1 January, 2007). If the threshold is exceeded, it will entail a taxation of the exceeding part of the company’s gross earnings. Ships used for exploration, diving, fishing, towing, sand dredging, etc. are specifically exempt from the scheme. The same applies for certain types of ships, such as barges, floating docks, etc. However, EU or European Economic Community (EEC) registered ships used for towage activities at sea (i.e. not in and around ports) during at least 50% of their operating time during the income year may be included in the Tonnage Tax Scheme.
Ship management companies may also use the Tonnage Tax Scheme. A ship manager is defined as a company doing business with crew management and technical management of ships qualified for use in the Tonnage Tax Scheme. It is a requirement that the ship manager has taken over the full operating responsibility and all obligations and responsibilities according to the International Safety Management codex.
#### **Taxable income**
The taxable income for the part of the business that qualifies for the Tonnage Tax Scheme is determined for each ship as a fixed amount of Danish kroner per 100 NT per day according to the following:
| Ship net ton (NT) | Fixed amount per day (DKK per 100 NT) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | 2025 |
| 0 to 1,000 | 11.32 | 11.76 |
| 1,001 to 10,000 | 8.113 | 8.44 |
| 10,001 to 25,000 | 4.86 | 5.05 |
| Over 25,000 | 3.20 | 3.32 |

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Repeal of immediate depreciation on IT software, knowhow and patent rights etc., and increase in deductions on expenses related to R&D activities
The bill is a partial implementation of the entrepreneurship initiative presented by the Danish Government on 12 June, 2024. The bill includes the following measures:
The bill was adopted on 28 November 2024 and came into effect on 1 January 2025.
## Implementation of the OECD's administrative guidelines on minimum taxation rules and amendment of the list of countries subject to defensive mesures
The bill to adopt the latest OECD guidelines on GloBE rules into the Danish implementation of Pillar II (the Minimum Taxation Act) was adopted on 7 December, 2023. The bill includes the following measures.
The bill is effective with respect to financial years commencing on 31 December 2023 or thereafter.
## Proposed repeal of taxation on dividends originating from unlisted portfolio shares (<10 pct. ownership)
On 2 October 2024 the Danish government presented a proposed bill aiming to partially implement the so-called Entrepreneurship Initiative presented by the Danish Government on 12 June, 2024.
The bill includes a proposed repeal of taxation on dividends from portfolio shares, meaning unlisted shares which constitute an ownership of less than 10 percent. Currently, a tax of 22% is levied 70 percent of the net amount of dividends from unlisted portfolio shares.
The tax exemptions will include both Danish and foreign investors. Foreign investors will in principle be tax liable with respect to these dividends, however, the tax rate will be 0 percent.
Furthermore, the tax exemption is conditional upon the recipient being the beneficial owner of the dividend.
## Increase in corporate income tax (CIT) for financial companies
Financial companies are imposed an increased CIT rate from 22% to 25.2% in 2023 and 26% in 2024. Financial companies include banks, mortgage credit institutions, investment management companies, and insurance companies.
The increase in CIT is connected with the adoption of a new bill on early retirement in Denmark, which is partly financed by this increase.
## Introduction of limited tax liabilitywhen establishing, operating, or otherwise using artificial islands, installations, or facilities in Denmark's exclusive economic zone
The bill seeks to equalise Danish and foreign companies by constituting permanent establishment (PE) on companies who are engaged in establishing, operating, or otherwise using artificial islands, installations, or facilities when these activities are carried out in Denmark's exclusive economic zone, i.e. outside the 12 nautical mile limit. As a result, these activities become subject to limited tax liability as a consequence of the PE.
A PE is not established when the activities performed are linked to the establishment and use of submarine cables and pipelines that are used exclusively for transit through Denmark's economic zone.
The bill was adopted 1 June, 2023. Parts of the law came into effect on July 1, 2023, while the entire law takes effect from January 1, 2024.
## Extension of the reporting obligation for foreign royalty payments
On 4 April, 2024, the Danish Parliament enacted legislation, introducing a requirement for reporting on foreign royalty payments regardless of whether there is an obligation to withhold taxes. The legislation became effective on 1 July, 2024.
Previously, companies granted an upfront exemption from withholding taxes on foreign royalty payments were not required to report such payments, provided there was no obligation to withhold royalty tax. The enactment of the new law requires companies to report all royalty payments and credits to the Danish Tax Authorities, regardless of whether there is an obligation to withhold taxes on the royalty payments. However, the reporting obligation does not apply if the royalty payments or credits are exempt under the EU Interest/Royalty Directive.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
A corporation is resident in Denmark for tax purposes if it is incorporated in Denmark and registered in the Companies Register as having a Danish place of business. Further, foreign companies having their actual place of management in Denmark are also tax resident in Denmark. The actual place of management is typically the place where the management decisions concerning the company’s day-to-day operations are made.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Non-resident companies are liable to tax in Denmark on business profits derived through a PE in Denmark. The existence of a PE is determined according to Danish tax law, which makes either a reference to a specific DTT or to text similar to Article 5 of the OECD Model Convention.
Denmark has adopted the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), which implies that the updated PE definition of the 2017 version of the OECD Model Convention will be directly applicable as regards Denmark’s DTTs with countries that have also adopted the MLI. As regards Denmark’s DTTs with countries that have not adopted the MLI, the specific PE definition in the respective DTT is still applicable.
A bill (Bill L48 2019-20) was adopted on 3 December 2020, which aligns the PE definition under Danish domestic tax law with the PE definition of the 2017 version of the OECD Model Convention. Bill L48 included a new definition of PEs by implementing an 'anti-fragmentation rule' into Danish tax law.
Up until the new legislation was implemented, a PE was deemed to not exist when a place of business was engaged solely in certain activities that were preparatory and auxiliary (such as maintenance of stocks of goods for storage, display, delivery, or processing, and purchasing of goods or merchandise).
According to the new definition, the exclusion will apply only when these activities are preparatory in relation to the business as a whole. The purpose of the new definition is to prevent the breakup of an operating business into several small business units in order to benefit from the preparatory and auxiliary exemption.
Furthermore, the Bill expands the scope of the agent rule. Thus the rule also includes situations in which an agent habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise. In such situations, the agent would create a PE.
As of July 2018, investments in shares and the acquisition of receivables, debt, and financial contracts are exempt from PE taxation if the individual investor’s investments cannot be classified as professionally trading and thus do not carry on business in Denmark that have a link to the partnership’s investment business. The purpose of this amendment was to make it more attractive for foreign investors to invest in Danish private equity funds.
Furthermore, the comments to OECD’s Model Tax Convention were revised in 2017. The question of the use of subcontractors for the execution of a contract in relation to the existence of a PE for the main contractor has been clarified. According to the revised comments, a PE will only exist for the main contractor if the subcontractors perform the work of the main contractor at a fixed place of business that is at the disposal of the main contractor. This assessment is, in most cases, based on the instruction powers. However, recent Danish case law regarding this revision shows that the Danish Tax Authorities may determine the existence of a fixed place of business for the main contractor on the basis of an evaluation of on whose 'expense and risk' the activities are carried on, as a decisive factor.
On 1 June 2023, the Danish Parliament enacted legislation to equalise Danish and foreign companies by constituting PE on companies who are engaged in establishing, operating, or otherwise using artificial islands, installations, or facilities when these activities are carried out in Denmark's exclusive economic zone, i.e. outside the 12 nautical mile limit. As a result, these activities become subject to limited tax liability as a consequence of the PE.
A PE is not established when the activities performed are linked to the establishment and use of submarine cables and pipelines that are used exclusively for transit through Denmark's economic zone.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Depreciation, amortisation, and depletion
Tax depreciation does not need to be in conformity with book depreciation.
For tax depreciation to apply, it is a condition that the asset on which the depreciation is to be claimed is used for business purposes by the owner. Furthermore, it is stipulated that unless otherwise specified, it is the owner of the depreciable asset who is eligible to claim depreciation.
### New machinery and equipment
Annual depreciation allowances on machinery and equipment may be claimed under the diminishing-balance method at up to 25%. The depreciation base is the cost of fixed assets minus sales proceeds from disposals and depreciation that has already been claimed.
New machinery and equipment acquired between 23 November 2020 and 31 December 2022 could be included in the base with a supplement of 16%. Hence, 116% of costs of new fixed assets was added to the base and depreciated at up to 25% per year. If a company has applied this principle, the assets in question must be kept on a separate account until the end of the tax year 2017.
If the acquisition cost of the respective asset is DKK 34,400 (2025) or below, an immediate depreciation can be applied. The same applies if the carrying amount before the year’s depreciation is below DKK 34,400 (2025), allowing the entire remaining balance to be depreciated in the particular year.
### Ships
For ships solely used commercially, the depreciation rate is up to 25% of the depreciable book value.
If the ship has a gross tonnage of 20 tons or more and is used for the commercial transport of passengers or goods, the depreciation rate is 20% in the year of construction (provided that the ship is not subject to tonnage taxation) and a 12% declining-balance basis in subsequent years.
If the acquisition involves a ship intended for leasing, or if the ship is already leased at time of the acquisition, the acquisition cost is not included in the depreciable book value for the acquisition year or the income year following the acquisition year. No depreciation can be applied to the ship in the acquisition year. In the following year, a separate depreciation of up to 50% of the acquisition cost can be applied. The portion of the acquisition cost for the ship that has not been deprecated must then be added to the regular depreciation balance for the second year after the acquisition year.
For ships used both for commercial and private purposes, the depreciation rate in the acquisition year is up to 25% of the acquisition cost. In the subsequent income years, depreciation can be applied to the amount remaining un-depreciated at the beginning of each income year. The proportionate share of the depreciated amount corresponding to the commercial use in the current income year can be deducted when calculating the taxable income.
### Buildings
Depreciation allowances on buildings (other than residential buildings and office buildings, etc. not adjoining a depreciable building) may be claimed at up to 4% *per annum* for buildings acquired before 1 January 2023 and 3% *per annum* for buildings acquired after 1 January 2023 on a straight-line basis. The same applies to installations that serve only depreciable buildings or are used exclusively for commercial purposes.
### Airplanes, trains, and utility plants
Airplanes, trains, and utility plants can be depreciated only at 15% *per annum* on a declining-balance basis.
### Rails, telecommunications facilities, and certain long-life plants and equipment
Rails, telecommunications facilities, and certain other long-life plants and equipment can be depreciated only at 7% *per annum* on a declining-balance basis.
### Recaptured as part of a capital gain on the sale of assets
Depreciation allowances that are recaptured as part of a capital gain on the sale of an asset generally are fully taxable.
### Goodwill and other intangible property rights
Acquired goodwill and other intangible property rights, patents or know-how (including rights/licences to utilise patents or know-how), can be amortized at up to 1/7 per year on a straight-line basis.
Certain restrictions regarding the depreciable value of goodwill apply in the case of group transactions. Goodwill on the purchase of shares cannot be amortized for tax purposes.
### Natural resources
Depletion of the cost of acquisition or exploitation of natural resources is subject to special rules.
## Start-up expenses
No specific rules in Danish tax law govern the treatment of start-up expenses. Instead, these expenses are treated according to general tax law.
## Interest expenses
## Bad debt
Companies may deduct loss on bad debt, which is not inter-company debt.
The main rule for calculation and taxation of companies’ gains and losses on receivables for tax purposes will be the mark-to-market principle (i.e. taxation based on the difference in value at the beginning and end of the assessment year). Use of the mark-to-market principle means that recognition of losses on these types of receivables for tax purposes is not conditional on a final loss having been ascertained.
Special rules apply to gains and losses on trade and inter-company receivables, as these, as a main rule, should be calculated according to realisation principles. Companies may, however, opt for the mark-to-market principle for each category of receivables.
## Charitable contributions
Companies may deduct a small amount in gifts to certain organisations approved by the Danish tax authorities and mentioned in the Danish tax authorities' guidelines. The deduction cannot exceed DKK 19,000 per year (2025).
Furthermore, companies may deduct gifts to cultural organisations that receive a maintenance grant for operating expenses from either the government or the municipality. According to these rules, there is no limitation in terms of value, but certain restrictions regarding the use of the gift are applicable.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are, in general, not deductible, as these are not considered operational expenses.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Even if considered economically reasoned and custom in certain jurisdictions, amounts used for bribery of officials are not deductible.
## Taxes
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. However, the utilisation of tax losses carried forward may be restricted. According to the rules, taxable income up to DKK 9,825,000 for 2025 (9,457,500 for 2024) can always be eliminated by tax losses carried forward, whereas taxable income exceeding DKK 9,825,000 can only be reduced by 60% as a result of tax losses carried forward. For Danish tax consolidation groups, the rules apply for the group collectively. If losses are restricted, the limitation must be allocated to each of the companies according to complex rules.
Certain restrictions on the right to carry tax losses forward apply when more than 50% of the share capital or 50% of the voting rights at the end of the financial year are owned by shareholders different from those that held control at the beginning of the income year in which the tax loss was incurred. Certain exceptions apply regarding intra-group transfers.
Similarly, under certain circumstances, tax losses may be cancelled if a Danish company receives a debt forgiveness or comparable transaction. However, there are numerous exceptions (e.g. inter-company transactions).
Tax losses may not be carried back for utilisation in previous income years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Danish corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management fees, and similar payments made to foreign affiliates, provided that such amounts are made on an arm’s-length basis and reflect services received. Interest at normal commercial rates paid to foreign affiliates will generally be allowed as a deduction but is subject to very complex thin capitalisation and interest relief limitation rules (*see* *Thin capitalisation and interest relief limitations* *in* *the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
### No deduction for payments to related recipients in countries or territories on the EU blacklist of tax havens
A payment can neither be deducted nor otherwise included in the calculation of taxable income of a Danish taxpayer, or in any other way allow the payment to affect the income statement, when the recipient of the payment is tax resident or registered in one of the countries or territories that are currently included in the EU blacklist of tax havens, when this is incorporated into Danish law, and the payee in question is also related to the taxpayer.
The blacklist includes the following countries and territories:
The measures came into effect 1 July 2024.
The payments covered are any consideration granted in connection with the acquisition of ownership or use of rights to an asset, benefit, or right, including consideration for loans or credits. The rule thus covers any form of consideration granted as a purchase price on the acquisition of assets, regardless of the nature of the asset. Likewise, any remuneration in the form of rent payments, leasing fees, and royalties granted as consideration for the right to dispose of real estate or movable or intangible assets. Also, remuneration for loans and credits are covered by the rule (e.g. interest) as well as remuneration in the form of one-off payments or an obligation to repay a larger amount than the amount lent.
The rule applies in all cases where:
The rule will not apply as regards payments for which it is proven that the beneficial owner of the payment is a tax resident in a country that is a member of the European Union or European Economic Area, or which has entered into a DTT with Denmark.

# Denmark
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Mandatory Danish tax consolidation
A mandatory tax consolidation regime obligates all Danish resident companies and Danish branches that are members of the same Danish or international group to file a joint group tax return. The definition of a group generally corresponds with the definition of a group for accounting purposes. The tax consolidated income is equal to the sum of the taxable income of each individual Danish company and Danish branches of foreign companies that are a member of the consolidated group.
Companies included in a mandatory tax consolidation are jointly and severally liable for payment of corporate taxes. WHTs on dividends, interest, and royalty payments are also covered by the joint and several liability. For companies with external minority shareholders, the company has a reduced liability and is merely liable if none of the other jointly taxed companies are able to pay the taxes.
## Elective cross-border tax consolidation
A non-Danish subsidiary may be included as a member to a Danish tax grouping, provided that the group includes all group companies and branches in the Danish tax grouping. In effect, this all-or-nothing provision rules out the possibility for major international groups to have their Danish subgroup file a Danish group tax return that includes only certain hand-picked (typically loss-making) foreign group members. Losses deducted in an elective cross-border tax consolidation will be recaptured either fully or to a limited extent.
If a general cross-border tax consolidation is established, it will be binding for ten years; however, there are certain possibilities of ‘breaking’ the ten-year period (e.g. in connection with takeovers). ‘Breaking’ the ten-year period will result in a full recapture of previously deducted tax losses.
The comments under Mandatory Danish tax consolidation with respect to the calculation of the tax consolidation income, ‘management company’, etc. generally also apply to international tax consolidation.
## Transfer pricing
A group must prepare detailed and extensive transfer pricing documentation to substantiate that intra-group transactions are conducted in accordance with the arm’s-length principle if it employs 250 or more employees (calculated as the average number of full-time employees during the income year).
If the group employs less than 250 employees, it will qualify for the small business exemption if it meets either of the following criteria: (i) has revenue under DKK 250 million or (ii) has a balance sheet sum under DKK 125 million.
However, an enterprise that is generally exempted from preparing transfer pricing documentation based on the above criteria must prepare transfer pricing documentation for transactions with group companies resident in countries outside the European Union / European Economic Area with which Denmark does not have a transfer pricing relevant double tax treaty.
The overall purpose of the transfer pricing documentation is to give the Danish tax authorities an opportunity to assess the prices and conditions used in order to determine whether inter-company transactions are conducted in accordance with the arm’s-length principle.
Denmark has implemented the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (including the latest updated version as of January 2022), under which the following transfer pricing documentation must be prepared:
The master file must contain standardised information relevant for the entire group, whereas the local file(s) must contain specific information on the local affiliate(s). It follows from the Executive Order on Documentation that a local file must be prepared for each legal entity even though the group has several entities in the same country.
The Danish tax authorities have clarified their interpretation of the documentation requirements with regard to benchmarking studies, stating that if a transfer pricing method is chosen where a benchmarking study is deemed necessary, such benchmarking study must be prepared; otherwise, the Danish tax authorities may consider the transfer pricing documentation as insufficient.
For income years beginning on 1 January 2021 or later, companies are required to submit the transfer pricing documentation no later than 60 days after the deadline for filing the tax return (the first time on 30 June 2022).
The Danish tax authorities may also impose a penalty of DKK 250,000 per year, per company where transfer pricing documentation is missing or is declared inadequate by the Danish tax authorities. If adequate documentation is subsequently submitted, the penalty may be reduced by 50%.
Furthermore, if an upward income adjustment is issued (i.e. on the basis that inter-company prices were not at arm’s length), the penalty may be increased by an amount equal to 10% of such adjustment. In addition, a surcharge and interest will be levied on underpaid tax related to any income increase.
The size of the penalty will be determined ultimately by the courts. However, recent case law has confirmed the penalty of DKK 250,000 per year, per company where the documentation is missing, declared inadequate, or has not been prepared on a contemporaneous basis. Trial cases are currently running at the courts regarding the penalty amounting to 10% of the income adjustment imposed by the tax authorities.
It should be noted that, as a general rule, controlled transactions between Danish entities are exempt from the documentation requirements in Denmark. However, this only applies in cases where the entities are taxed under the same regime (i.e. if one part in the controlled transaction is taxed according to a different tax regime [as specified by the law], then the controlled transactions still need to be documented).
The Danish tax authorities may request the taxpayer to obtain an independent auditor’s report. The Danish tax authorities can request the statement seven days after receiving the transfer pricing documentation. The circumstances for requesting an auditor’s statement are:
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Groups with a consolidated turnover of DKK 5.6 billion (EUR 750 million) or more, based on previous year's turnover, must additionally prepare a CbC report. The CbC report must contain a range of information for each country in which the group operates, including revenue, profit, tax, capital structure, assets, and employees. Furthermore, the group has to identify each entity within the group and specify the entities’ tax residencies and the activities of each entity.
The deadline for submission of the CbC report is 12 months after the end of the income year (i.e. for the financial year 2020, the deadline is the end of 2021). The rules apply for income years starting on 1 January 2016 or later. A Danish subsidiary, which is part of a multinational group, but is not the ultimate parent entity, will have to file the CbC report if certain requirements are met. However, this is only applicable for income years starting 1 January 2017 or later.
Additionally, Danish taxpayers must notify the Danish tax authorities about which group entity is obligated to file the CbC report. To notify the Danish tax authorities, the taxpayer submits the notification through the Danish online filing system (TastSelv) at the company’s tax folder (*skattemappe*). The notification should be submitted before the year-end of the year covering the CbC report (e.g. if the CbC report will include information for the financial year ending 31 December 2021, the notification must be submitted no later than 31 December 2021).
## Thin capitalisation and interest relief limitations
Danish resident companies and Danish branches of foreign companies are subject to three sets of restrictions, each of which may seriously limit or disallow Danish tax deductions for financing costs.
Firstly, there is the thin capitalisation rule. This rule works to disallow gross interest costs and capital losses on related company debt to the extent the overall debt-to-equity ratio based on market values exceeds 4:1. Related company debt includes external bank debt if group member companies have provided guarantees to the bank. This rule only applies if the controlled debt exceeds DKK 10 million. When calculating the 4:1 ratio, a special consolidation rule applies if two or more companies are considered affiliated (note that the definition of affiliated companies differs from the definition under the Danish rules on joint taxation). There is no recharacterisation of interest as dividends.
Secondly, there is an asset-based rule that applies in relation to financing costs that remain after the thin capitalisation limitation. To the extent a Danish company on a stand-alone basis or, if part of a joint tax group, together with group companies has net financing costs in excess of DKK 21.3 million, the deductibility of the remaining financing costs can be limited to an amount equal to 5,8% for tax year 2025 (6% in 2024) of the tax basis of certain assets of the group. Net financing costs consist of, among other things, interest income/expenses, taxable gains/losses on debt, receivables and financial contracts, taxable gains/losses on shares, and taxable dividends.
Thirdly, there is an EBITDA-based rule that works to limit the deductibility of financing costs that remain after the thin capitalisation test and the asset-based rule to an amount equal to 30% of the Danish company’s/tax group’s taxable EBITDA income. This rule applies the same definition of net financing costs as the asset-based rule, and it allows for a minimum deduction of DKK 22.3 million. Exceeding borrowing costs that are disallowed by the EBITDA rule can indefinitely be carried forward for potential use, and unutilised interest deduction capacity can be carried forward for the five following income years.
If a Danish resident company has a debt to a non-Danish resident creditor (person or company) that considers the payments as dividends on a contributed capital (hybrid financing), the debt will also, in accordance with Danish rule, be requalified as equity. The Danish debtor company is then cut off from deducting the interest cost and/or capital losses on the requalified debt.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
According to the Danish CFC rules, a Danish company has to include in its taxable income either the total taxable income of a subsidiary or the CFC income of the subsidiary, foreign or Danish, if such subsidiary qualifies as a CFC. A subsidiary qualifies as a CFC if all of the following criteria are met:
## Adopted implementation of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD)
### General anti-avoidance rule (GAAR)
One of the main components of the adopted rules is the introduction of a GAAR, which applies not only to cross-border transactions, but also to domestic Danish transactions, where benefits may be denied if tax avoidance is a key purpose of the transactions and the transactions do not have real substance.
### Hybrid mismatches
The rules apply when hybrid mismatches arise in situations where a risk of tax avoidance exists due to different treatment of entities in different jurisdictions (e.g. between an entity and its PE or between associated entities). The new hybrid mismatch rules are effective from 1 January 2020. The definition of an associated person is, as a starting point, a person that has an influence over another person of at least 25% voting rights, profits, and share capital, but can range to a requirement of 50% ownership for specific hybrid mismatches.
### Thin capitalisation
The scope of the thin capitalisation rule, as mentioned above, regarding tax exemption for the creditor to cover the circumstance when a foreign subsidiary’s interest deductions are limited under other EU/EEA member states’ thin capitalisation rules, is expanded.
Exemption cannot exceed the interest deduction restriction in the case where both companies would have been Danish tax residents.
### Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA)
### Exit taxation
The rules regarding exit taxation apply for income years starting 1 January 2020 and thereafter. The rules imply that the maximum period of deferral of exit taxes is reduced from seven years to five years. Furthermore, with the new rules, assets that are brought under Danish tax jurisdiction will, as a general rule, obtain a fair market value basis for tax purposes.
## Minimum Tax Act (adoption of the GloBE rules from Pillar II)
On 7 December, 2023, the Danish Parliament enacted legislation, specifically the Minimum Tax Act, incorporating Pillar Two into Danish Law. The bill implements the EU directive of 15 December, 2022 and the OECD Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules ensuring a global effective minimum taxation of 15 percent. The Minimum Tax Act comes into effect on 31 December 2023.
The rules apply to group entities that are part of a multinational group or a large national group, where the group has had an annual turnover of at least EUR 750 million (approx. DKK 5.6 billion) in two of the last four financial years before the current year. The calculation of the effective tax rate is based on a specially calculated tax base, determined with reference to the consolidated financial statements of the group, and an assessment of the taxes that may be included in the calculation of the effective tax rate.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
PEs of foreign companies are taxed under the same rules and rates as Danish resident companies. There is no branch remittance tax or other similar tax on repatriation of branch profits unless specific anti-avoidance rules apply. As a branch is considered to be the same legal entity as the headquarters, interest and other payments made from the branch to the foreign head office are seen as internal payments that are not tax deductible.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Capital expenditure incentives
A variety of tax incentives are available in the form of deductions for certain capital expenditures.
Danish tax law allows for an immediate write-off of capital expenditures for R&D. Alternatively, the taxpayer may choose to take tax depreciation in the same year and the following four years on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred in connection with the exploration for raw materials may also be fully deducted in the same year.
Companies in a loss-making situation may not benefit from an immediate write-off of R&D costs. However, companies have been granted the opportunity to apply to the Danish tax authorities for a payment equal to the tax value (22%) of negative taxable income. It is a condition that the negative taxable income relates to R&D costs. The rule does not cover costs incurred in connection with exploration for raw materials. The negative taxable income is calculated on the total negative income of the companies participating in the joint taxation, thus the company incurring the R&D costs does not need to have negative taxable income to request for the payment, as long as the joint taxation income is negative.
Tax payment according to this rule cannot exceed an amount of DKK 5.5 million, corresponding to a tax loss relating to R&D expenditure of DKK 25 million. For companies participating in joint taxation, the limit applies for all companies in total.
Furthermore, the Danish Parliament has introduced an increased deduction for R&D costs gradually increasing from 100% to 110% over a period of eight years.
| Year | Deduction rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 2018-2019 | 101.5 |
| 2020 | 103.0\* |
| 2021-2022 | 105.0\* |
| 2023-2025 | 108.0 |
| 2026 | 110.0 |
| 2027 | 116.0 |
| 2028 | 120.0 |
The total amount of deductible R&D expenses exceeding an annually adjusted amount can only be deducted at a rate of 110% as of the calendar year 2026.
| Year | Deduction cap (DKK) |
| --- | --- |
| 2020 | 845 million\*\* |
| 2021-2023 | 910 million\*\* |
| 2024 | 1 billion (annually adjusted) |
The total amount of deductible R&D expenses are calculated at group level for entities in the same joint taxation group.
In relation to the above-mentioned tax incentive scheme, only the actual incurred R&D costs may be included in the request for the cash payment from the Danish tax authorities. The remaining deduction exceeding the 100% will be a negative taxable income that will increase the net operating loss carried forward.
\* The rate for 2020 to 2022 is 130% for qualifying R&D expenses within certain limits.
\*\* The exceeding amount may only be deducted at a rate of 110% as of the calendar year 2026.
## Foreign tax credit
According to Danish tax law, relief is generally available to credit foreign tax paid on non-Danish source profits against the Danish tax on the same profits. As Danish companies are not taxed on income from foreign PEs or properties, the rules have limited application.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
## Tax-free restructuring
Restructuring (e.g. mergers, demergers, share exchanges, drop-down of assets) can, in many cases, be carried out tax-free under the provisions of the EU Mergers Directive as implemented into Danish law. These types of restructuring can be carried out in a tax-exempt manner without prior approval from the tax authorities. However, several objective conditions must be fulfilled. Formation, merger, reorganisation, and liquidation expenses are non-deductible if related to external assistance. However, if any costs related to the restructuring are incurred as employee wages within the group, the cost of the wages can be deducted.
## Cross-border mergers
Companies domiciled abroad are subject to Section 15 of the Danish Merger Tax Act. Thus, a cross-border merger requires, that:
In order to address cases where mergers retroactively exclude income earned in Denmark from taxation, a new provision was implemented in the Danish law concerning mergers in June 2018. This provision prevents cross-border mergers, in which a foreign company is the recipient company and where income that is earned in the Danish company before the merger took place, is exempted from Danish taxation. The merger date for the Danish company that participates in a tax-exempt cross-border merger with a foreign company shall be the date on which the merger is adopted in all the merging companies. Therefore, the merger date cannot be prior to the date of the actual merger of all the merging companies. The new rule has retroactive effect for cross-border mergers adopted by one or more of the participating companies on 23 March 2018 or later.
## Danish Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States (US)
Denmark has entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA Model 1) with the United States on the Danish implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The IGA is implemented into Danish law and is, to a large extent, an overlay to existing Danish tax reporting rules applying to Danish banks. The scope of FATCA is, however, wider than the existing rules in terms of both entities and products covered and customer due diligence procedures. The IGA implies that Danish foreign financial institutions (FFIs) must report to the Danish tax authorities instead of directly to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Denmark-US IGA contains important exceptions for both the Danish mutual fund and pension savings industries.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
Denmark is among the ‘early adopters’ of the CRS, whereby the first exchange of information took place in 2017.
The Council Directive 2014/107/EU, amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation, has been fully implemented in Denmark and is effective from 1 January 2016.
## Reporting under FATCA/CRS
The reporting financial institutions must submit the required information under FATCA/CRS through the online system solution of the Danish tax authorities. The reporting deadline is 1 May and is the same under both regimes.
## DAC6
The EU Council Directive 2011/16 in relation to cross-border tax arrangements, known as DAC6, has been in force since 25 June 2018. DAC6 aims at transparency and fairness in taxation.
DAC6 applies to cross-border tax arrangements, which meet one or more specified characteristics (hallmarks), and which concern either more than one EU country or an EU country and a non-EU country. It mandates a reporting obligation for these tax arrangements if in scope, no matter whether the arrangement is justified according to national law.
The reporting obligation is required of both the relevant taxpayer(s) and its advisors.
Failure to comply with DAC6 could mean facing significant sanctions under local law in EU countries and reputational risks for businesses, individuals, and intermediaries.
Denmark has implemented DAC6 as part of Danish law by Act. No. 1573 of 27 December 2019.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident in Denmark is entitled to deduct foreign income taxes paid or accrued on foreign-source income from the Danish tax payable up to a maximum of Danish tax paid on that part of the taxable income that is foreign-source income. Relief according to DTTs may be claimed if their provisions are more favourable.
Unutilised credits are not refundable and cannot be carried back or forward.
## Tax treaties
### Double taxation treaties (DTTs)
To avoid double taxation on income, Denmark has concluded DTTs with a large number of countries. All tax treaties contain rules on tax information exchanges, and specific EU regulations also apply.
Double taxation may also occur in relation to inheritance tax. To counteract this situation, Denmark has concluded treaties with the other Scandinavian countries, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States in this respect.
Countries with which Denmark currently has DTTs and where the treaty contains a remuneration clause are:
| Argentina | Faroe Islands | Latvia | Sweden |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
The employment deduction is raised to a maximum of DKK 55,600 in 2025.
Furthermore, the taxation of share income is eased by raising the threshold for when the higher tax rate of 42% on share income must be paid instead of 27%. In 2025 a 27% tax rate apply on the first DKK 67,500 of share income, and a 42% on share income exceeding DKK 67,500.
For married couples living together at the end of the income year, the thresholds are doubled.
The thresholds are to be raised in 2026 and 2027.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Deductions that have not been taken into consideration in connection with the preliminary tax return and therefore have not led to a reduction of the monthly withheld tax may lead to a refund of tax when the final tax for an income year is assessed.
Deductions can only be made related to income from sources that are taxable in Denmark, and it is not possible to deduct expenses exceeding the income.
## Employment expenses
In general, an employment allowance is available for any individual engaged in active employment. The allowance amounts to 12.30% of the employment income and cannot exceed DKK 55,600 (in 2025).
Furthermore, under certain circumstances, salary earners' expenses related to the performance of their work, such as technical literature, work clothes, etc., may be deductible from the taxable income if they exceed a basic amount (DKK 7,300 in 2025).
### Travel to and from work
Usage of the Øresund connection (the bridge and tunnel between Denmark and Sweden), or the Storebælts connection (the bridge and tunnel between the Island of Funen and Sealand) also entitles one to an extra mileage allowance. The allowance amount depends on the means of transport.
### Deductions for travel expenses
The right to deduct travel expenses is maximised to DKK 32,800 annually (2025). The maximum applies to both the deduction of standard rate and actual expenses but does not affect an employer’s ability to pay tax-free allowances, reimburse the employees expenses, or provide free food and lodging.
In general, the rules regarding deductions of travel expenses imply that employees in relation to a work-related trip can either get their expenses reimbursed by the employer as a business expense or make deductions when determining taxable income.
Allowances/deductions can either be based on actual documented expenses or on standard rates. In 2025, the standard rates are DKK 597 per day for meals and miscellaneous and DKK 256 per day for lodging.
### Contributions to pension schemes
Contributions to a lifelong annuity pension plan established with a Danish pension fund, an insurance company, or a financial institution are tax-exempt if made by the employer and, within certain limits, tax deductible if made by the individual.
In addition to the tax benefit from the above-mentioned exemption/deduction for contributions, the contributions will also trigger an additional tax deduction in the tax calculation; up to a certain limit. The rate depends on the age of the taxpayer; the closer to the retirement age, the higher the deduction rate.
As a general rule, deductible contributions to a pension plan may not exceed DKK 65,500 (2025) if paid by the individual into a private pension plan, and the same ceiling applies as to contributions paid by the employer (i.e. DKK 65,500 [2025]) unless it is a lifelong annuity plan. However, due to special regulations applicable in connection with later repatriation, the contribution paid by/for an expatriate to a Danish pension plan should be handled carefully.
Contributions to a foreign pension scheme may be tax exempt/tax deductible if certain circumstances are observed or according to certain DTTs.
### Moving costs
### Service expenses
Certain approved expenses regarding household services may be deducted. The deduction is capped at DKK 12,400 in 2025 per individual.
For 2025, the deductible value for the use of household services is around 25%.
### Double household
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Donations to certain approved charities, foundations, institutions, etc. are deductible in the determination of taxable income. The maximum deductible amount per year is DKK 19,000 (in 2025), regardless of whether the contributions are spread out among different foundations. The foundation must report the donations made annually to the tax authorities.
### Child benefits
### Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible from capital income and are generally deducted in the year in which they fall due. Penalty interest paid in connection with late payment of taxes is non-deductible. Deduction of interest expenses covering a period of more than six months and falling due more than six months before the end of that period must be allocated to the period to which the expenses relate.
### Bad debt
In general, losses on debt are not deductible or refundable.
### Association expenses
A taxpayer can deduct expenses incurred for quotas for membership of employer associations, unions (maximum DKK 7,000 per year [2025]), and other professional associations that aim to defend the economic interests of the professional group to which the taxpayer falls. Furthermore, contributions to unemployment insurance schemes and pre-retirement schemes are deductible. Deductions are made in the determination of taxable income. The associations must annually report the payments received from each member to the tax authorities.
### Fines and penalties
Private persons cannot deduct any fines or penalties. If an employer pays fines imposed on employees in carrying out their work, the employer may deduct the amounts, but the payout will be considered taxable income for the employee who cannot deduct the fine.
## Personal allowances
## Losses
The treatment of losses depends on whether the shares are quoted or unquoted. Losses on shares quoted on a regulated stock exchange can be offset against gains (i.e. dividends and capital gains) on other quoted shares within the same year. Any unused losses may be carried forward for an unlimited period of time. If the taxpayer is married, any unused losses can also be offset against the spouse’s gains on quoted shares.
Losses on unquoted shares can be offset against gains (i.e. dividends and capital gains) on both quoted and unquoted shares within the same year. If the total annual share income becomes negative, the tax value of the loss on unquoted shares (27%/42%) may be deducted from the ordinary income taxes of the individual liable to taxation.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Employment income
All remuneration from employment, whether in cash or in kind, is subject to tax when the employee has obtained a legal right to the remuneration, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether remitted. The liability extends to any living or housing allowance and any reimbursement of tax or other personal liability, whether paid directly to an employee or borne by the employer on the employee’s behalf.
The Danish Parliament has adjusted the rates for taxation of company cars in order to promote environmental and climate 'friendly' cars, which are used as company cars. Accordingly, the thought is that the environmental amount in the coming years will be weighted higher in the total taxation of a company car, while the purchase price must be weighted less.
These adjustments of the rates are gradual and takes place between 2021 and 2025, as illustrated in the below table:
| Percentage | Prior 1 July 2021 | 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rate on the car value up to DKK 300,000 | 25 | 24.5 | 24 | 23.5 | 23 | 22.5 |
| Rate on the car value above DKK 300,000 | 20 | 20.5 | 21 | 21.5 | 22 | 22.5 |
| Environmental charge | 150 | 250 | 350 | 450 | 600 | 700 |
Payments by reimbursement to an employee for expenses for travel, entertainment, or any other service to be performed on behalf of the employer are taxable only to the extent that they are not actually expended in the performance of the service. Special rules apply for free housing provided by the employer. For some work-related benefits in kind, a limit of DKK 7,300 (2025) applies. Further, there are special rules related to tax-free allowances for travel costs and mileage.
Any employee who is given a free telephone from their employer is taxed on DKK 3,300 (2025), regardless of actual usage and saved private expenditures. If spouses are both comprised by this tax, a reduction of the tax is applicable.
## Equity compensation
Share-based payments are, as a starting point, taxed as any other remuneration from employment, with the marginal tax rate at approximately 56%. However, the rules are very complicated and dependent on the specific situation. A beneficial reward scheme has been reintroduced from 1 July 2016.
Further, special rules apply under certain conditions and limitations for 'small start-up businesses', as defined in the legislation.
## Business income
In general, private business owners (i.e. individuals operating a business on their own account and risk) are comprised by the general tax rates, etc. as employees. However, a number of rules and practises only apply to private business owners.
It may be possible for independent business owners to use a special tax scheme, the Business Tax Scheme. This scheme primarily ensures that private business owners get full value when deducting commercial investments (e.g. interest expenses) thereby increasing the possibilities of consolidating and expanding the business by taxing the savings more gently than savings made for private purpose.
To obtain the approval to apply the Business Tax Scheme, a number of formalities regarding bank accounts, withdrawals, and accounting, ensuring that private and corporate funds can be distinguished, must be observed. Basically, the business taxable profit is all taxable income with deduction of all corporate expenses. When using the Business Tax Scheme, the business profit that is not cashed for private use is taxed at 22%, which is equivalent to the corporate tax.
## Capital gains and investment income
Generally speaking, Denmark imposes tax on capital gains arising from the sale of private (non-business) assets. Typical assets not subject to capital gains taxation (if assets are non-business related) are furniture, art, and jewellery.
### Properties
Gains from the sale of a privately owned property, which has served as the primary place of living for the owner (during the period of ownership), will not be subject to capital gain taxation if the property is located on a lot/land that is less than 1,400 square metres in size. This is known as the '*parcelhusregel*'. If the lot/land is larger than 1,400 square metres, then the realised gain may still be exempted from taxation depending on actual circumstances. A similar rule exists for vacation houses/properties (known as '*sommerhusreglen*'), although conditions differ somewhat from what applies for ordinary houses/properties.
Taxable capital gains from the sale of other property acquired after 1 January 1999 are taxed either as personal income or capital income. Special transitional rules apply to profits on property acquired before 1 January 1999 and sold in the income year 1999 or later.
For individuals subject to full tax liability (resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark), foreign properties owned are subject to special exit tax rules. Under these rules, an unrealised gain due to increase in the property value (of a property located outside of Denmark) will be subject to exit tax upon departure from Denmark. Gain is determined based on value of the property upon arrival to Denmark (or date of purchase if bought while already living in Denmark) converted to Danish kroner using the exchange rate on the date of arrival/date of purchase, and then the value of the property in Danish kroner using the exchange rate on the date the Danish tax liability (tax liability as resident subject to taxation on worldwide income) ceases.
### Capital gains and investment income
Taxable gains and investment income are added to the taxable income. Certain allowances are available.
The taxable income of an individual subject to full tax liability (resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark) includes interest, dividends, profits from gains on sale of shares, rents, royalties, professional fees, pensions, annuities, and alimony from all sources, wherever located, subject to any limitation that may be imposed under a tax treaty.
While sale of ordinary shares is taxable based on a realisation principle, a so-called mark-to-market taxation is applied on certain investment funds, ETFs, etc., which implies that each year taxable gain/loss is to be declared even though a sale has not actually occurred. The gain/loss is determined based on the market value at the start of the year compared to the value end of the year (values for start and end of the year will be changed to value upon arrival/departure if moving to/out of Denmark during the year). Value is to be converted to Danish kroner using the exchange rate at start of the year/end of the year, so this will cover both gain due to increase in value of the investment fund, etc. and gain due to currency fluctuations.
A person must declare income/gain/loss along with the filing of a Danish tax return each year, including profit/loss above a threshold of DKK 2,000 concerning bonds, certain other securities, and realised gains due to exchange rate fluctuations on deposits or debt in foreign currency.
Capital gains taxation also applies to capital gains related to transactions of funds between accounts kept in other country of Danish kroner, where a capital gains arises due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the relevant currency and Danish kroner between the time where the money was originally deposited and the time where the same funds are later withdrawn. In this regard, a first in first out principle is applied. Capital gain determined in this regard is composed by the threshold of DKK 2,000 per year (*see above*). This type of capital gain evaluation is to be made for persons who are considered resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark and will include any withdrawals of funds from accounts with funds in other currency than Danish kroner (possible also for transfers between accounts in the same bank), payments made to reduce mortgage principal, etc.
### Pension
In certain cases, foreign pension plans will not qualify as tax approved under Danish tax rules, and, in that case, the pension plan will be subject to mark-to-market taxation. This applies for individuals subject to full tax liability (resident and tax treaty resident in Denmark).
The gain/loss is determined based on the market value at the start of the year compared to the value at the end of the year (values for start and end of the year will be changed to value upon arrival/departure if moving to/out of Denmark during the year). Value is to be converted to Danish kroner using the exchange rate at the start of the year/end of the year, so this will cover both gain due to increase in value of the pension plan and gain due to currency fluctuations.
Besides the capital gains taxation, there may also be possible taxation related to contributions made to the foreign pension plan if such are still being made.
## Treatment of intellectual property (IP)
Individuals shall include profit or loss regarding sales of IP in their personal income. This means that profit from sale is subject to ordinary taxation.
Royalties, defined as payment for the right to use any patent, trademark, secret formula, etc., are subject to a fixed tax rate of 22%, which must be withheld by the payer of the royalty. According to many tax treaties, Denmark has either waived right to tax the royalties or accepted a lower tax.

A personal allowance of DKK 51,600 (in 2025) is granted to all individuals over the age of 18. For individuals under the age of 18, the personal allowance is DKK 51,600 (in 2025). The personal allowance leads to a reduction of income tax. Where a spouse cannot utilise the whole personal allowance, the balance is normally transferred to the other spouse. The value of the tax reduction is calculated based on the applicable tax rates.
For individuals who are subject to limited tax liability, the personal allowance is granted only in relation to income such as salaries and pensions, and where the individual is subject to limited tax liability to Denmark during the whole year. If the individual is subject to limited tax liability to Denmark for less than one year, the personal allowance may be chosen based on certain conditions.

An individual who does not set up residence will become subject to full Danish tax liability from the first day of one’s stay if one stays in Denmark for at least six consecutive months. When determining the six-month period, short stays outside Denmark due to holidays etc. are included, whereas stays abroad due to employment may interrupt the six-month period.
