## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Social security contributions
The Social Security Law deals with the various benefits from and payments to the National Insurance Scheme.
The scheme is financed by the individual's and employer's social security contributions in addition to grants from the state and the municipalities. The individual's contribution is charged at a higher rate for self-employed persons (11%) than for employees (7.8%). The employer's contribution (14.1%) must be paid with respect to salaries, etc. The rates are determined by the Parliament in the annual decrees on contributions to the National Insurance Scheme.
Social security contributions are levied on the ‘personal income’ base.
### Employee's contribution
The following conditions apply to both employed and self-employed individuals:
The individual's contribution is not deductible for their tax purposes.
### Employer's contribution
The employer must also make social security contributions. The contribution is based on total Norwegian gross salary (and taxable benefit) costs. The employer’s contribution is levied at a rate of 14.1% but could be lower when the employer is established in certain sparsely populated areas. The employer share increases 5% (meaning a total rate of 19.1%) for income exceeding NOK 850,000 (NOK 750,000 in 2023).
Social security agreements may exempt the employer from this tax *(see the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](norway/individual/foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for a list of countries with which social security agreements exist*). If a similar social security contribution is paid to another state based on the same salaries, etc., then a credit may be applied for against the employer's Norwegian social security costs.
The employer's contribution is deductible for tax purposes of the employer insofar as the wages to which it relates are deductible.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a tax on sales. It is due to be paid when sales of goods and taxable services are taking place at all stages in the chain of distribution within Norway. VAT is also levied on imports.
The expenses (actual costs) are included in the following VAT rates:
## Wealth taxes
Individuals pay both municipal wealth tax and state wealth tax.
The municipal wealth tax rate is 0.7% and is calculated based on assets exceeding a net capital tax basis of NOK 1.7 million for single/not married taxpayers and NOK 3.4 million for married couples.
The state wealth tax rate is 0.3% and is calculated based on assets exceeding a net capital tax basis of NOK 1.7 million for single/not married taxpayers and NOK 3.4 million for married couples. For 2022, a new step for the state rate is introduced. For net wealth in excess of NOK 20 million (NOK 40 million for married couples), the rate is 0.4%.
Thus, the maximum wealth tax rate is 1.1%.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance and gift tax was removed as of 1 January 2014.
## Property taxes
## Possible changes in exit taxation
On 20 March 2024, the Ministry of Finance issued a proposal for consultation regarding the amendment of the rules on the taxation of capital gains, etc. upon emigration. The proposed rules entail that individuals moving from Norway will be subject to an exit tax, which is to be paid in full upon emigration, in instalments over 12 years, or in full after 12 years. The rules have an uncertain aspect in relation to EEA law and could severely impact heirs. The consultation deadline expired on 21 May 2024, and the hearing is currently marked as not yet concluded.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at cost or the production value for goods produced by the taxpayer, including goods produced to order. Cost is normally determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. The last in first out (LIFO) method is not acceptable for tax purposes. Conformity between book and tax reporting is not required. Tax deduction for loss of value is only permitted on disposal.
## Capital gains
Capital gains realised in the course of a business activity are almost always regarded as taxable income. Gains resulting from real estate transactions are taxed, regardless of whether they are incurred in connection with business activity. Losses may be offset against the taxpayer’s other income.
Capital gains realised on both business-related and non-business-related securities are, in principle, taxable. In general, any capital gains realised on bonds at maturity are regarded as taxable income. Correspondingly, realised losses will be eligible for deductions.
## Tax (participation) exemption for corporate shareholders
Under the participation exemption rules, corporate shareholders are generally exempt from tax on dividends received, on capital gains from qualifying shares, and on derivatives where the underlying object is qualifying shares. Correspondingly, corporate losses on qualifying shares are non-deductible.
All operating expenses related to exempt income from shares (e.g. management costs) are fully tax deductible. Dividends received only fall under the participation exemption for 97% of the received value, with the remaining 3% taxable at the standard corporate rate of 22%, providing for an effective tax rate of 0.66%. Dividend distributions within a tax group (where the ultimate parent company directly or indirectly owns more than 90% of the shares and voting rights) are, however, fully tax exempt, reflecting that an alternative in many cases would be a tax neutral group contribution.
The 100% exemption is also applicable for dividends received from qualifying EU/EEA companies provided that the ownership requirement is fulfilled.
In addition, the participation exemption rule applies for certain distributions from partnerships and, under certain conditions, to foreign-resident companies with taxable activity in Norway. However, distributions on hybrid instruments will not be tax exempt if the distribution is deductible for the distributing company.
However, for investments outside the EEA, the tax exemption rules only apply if a shareholder owns 10% or more of the share capital and the voting rights of the foreign company for a consecutive period of two or more years. To be able to deduct losses on the realisation of shareholdings outside the EEA, the shareholder and/or a related party may not own 10% or more of the share capital and the voting rights of the foreign company at any point in a two-year period prior to the realisation. For dividends, the holding period of two years does not have to be met when dividends are distributed but can also be met after the dividend date.
Shareholdings in low-tax countries outside of the EEA do not qualify for the participation-exemption rules. The Directorate of Taxes has published a non-exhaustive list of *de facto* low-tax jurisdictions (black list) and non-low-tax jurisdictions (white list).
Acquisition and sales related costs (e.g. broker fees) must be added to the cost basis of the shares for tax purposes. Costs incurred to manage acquired tax-exempt shares are, however, tax deductible.
Norway’s domestic tax rules do not allow taxation of a non-resident’s capital gain on the disposal of financial instruments, including shares in Norwegian companies, unless the non-resident has a PE to which the financial instrument may be allocated.
### **Stock dividends**
Stock dividends (bonus shares) are not taxable on receipt, provided that the dividends have been distributed in accordance with the Limited Liability Company Acts and distributed in proportion with the ownership level of the shares.
### **Tax treatment of investments in mutual funds**
The taxation of investments in mutual funds will be determined by the proportion of shares in the fund. Distributions from mutual funds with a share proportion between 20% and 80% will be split between dividend and interest income on a *pro rata* basis. Furthermore, distributions from funds with more than 80% shares will only be taxed as dividends, and funds with less than 20% shares will only be taxed as interest.
## Interest income
In general, interest income is taxable on an accrual basis.
## Royalty income
In general, royalty income is taxable on an accrual basis.
## Foreign income
A Norwegian resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income. Double taxation of foreign-source income, including foreign-branch income and CFC income, is mitigated either through tax treaties or domestic tax provisions. A deduction for foreign tax may either be claimed as an expense or as a credit against Norwegian tax payable on that income. In most cases, foreign dividends are exempt according to the participation exemption rules. As a consequence, foreign WHT may not be credited and constitutes a real cost for the companies concerned.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
Norway imposes WHT on dividends paid to foreign shareholders. The internal WHT rate on dividends is 25%, which may either be reduced under the exemption rule or by an applicable tax treaty. To qualify for the exemption rule, the recipient of the dividends has to be a corporate investor resident in an EEA country and must also fulfil certain substance requirements.
Norway imposes a 15% WHT rate on the gross payment on interest, royalties, and certain payments for lease of tangible assets to related parties resident in low-tax jurisdictions. WHT will not be imposed when the related party recipient of the interest, royalty, or lease payments is tax resident in an EEA state and is actually established and carries out genuine business activities.
A tax treaty may also reduce or exempt WHT on the payment.

# Norway
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year for individuals equals the calendar year (i.e. January thru December).
## Tax returns
Individuals will receive a pre-drafted tax return from the tax authorities to be controlled, corrected, and filed by 30 April of the consecutive year after the income year. Extensions may be granted by the tax authorities.
In cases where no amendments of the pre-drafted tax return needs to be made, filing is not required since the tax authorities will consider the pre-drafted tax return as accepted by the individual, and the tax assessment will be based on the information in the pre-drafted tax return.
Individuals on source tax (PAYE) are not required to file a tax return.
## Payment of tax
Individuals taxable in Norway are obligated to pay tax in advance during the income year. This applies to employees as well as self-employed persons. The employer must, without prior request, withhold taxes in advance. This also applies to foreign employers with employees working in Norway. An employer is defined as the person who oneself or through an authorised person pays the wages or other remuneration subject to the obligation to withhold taxes in advance. In case of hiring out of labour, both the contractor and subcontractor are responsible for fulfilment of this obligation.
The withholding is based on tax deduction cards issued by the local Assessment Office. This may either be a source tax card (PAYE) or an ordinary tax withholding card. If a tax deduction card has not been provided to the employer, the employer must withhold 50% of gross payments.
Advance tax paid by individuals as regards income not subject to withholding must be affected in four equal instalments during the income year, on 15 March, 15 May, 15 September, and 15 November. If the advance tax is not paid when due, an interest charge is imposed on the taxpayer.
When the assessed tax is higher than the withholding or advance tax, the difference is payable by the taxpayer in two equal instalments 3 and 8 weeks after the date on which the assessment has been made public. No payment is due before 20 August. Interest is charged on the amount equal to the instructive interest determined by the Norwegian National Bank less 22%. The taxpayer may avoid interest by making additional payments before 31 May in the assessment year. If the prepayments are greater than the assessed tax, the difference plus interest is refunded to the taxpayer.
## Tax audit process
In certain cases, the taxable income and capital will be estimated by the assessment authorities at their discretion. This applies when the information given by the taxpayer is not considered to constitute a proper basis for the assessment and when the taxpayer has not filed a tax return or given other requested information.
The assessment will normally be finalised between June and October in the assessment year, depending on the nature of the taxpayer's income. A notice of assessment is sent to the taxpayer.
## Statute of limitations
A taxpayer can alter their personal tax assessment three years after the ordinary deadline.
The deadline for raising issues for amendment is normally five years after the end of the tax assessment period. The deadline is ten years if the taxpayer is subject to aggravated additional tax or is reported for violations of the penal provisions in Straffeloven.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Norwegian tax legislation distinguishes between full tax liability for resident taxpayers and limited tax liability for non-resident taxpayers. Residents are liable to income tax on their worldwide income, whereas non-resident taxpayers are only subject to income tax on specific types of income from Norwegian sources.
To simplify reporting and compliance for temporary employment in Norway, a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system is introduced and in force from 1 January 2019. The PAYE scheme is applicable for limited tax liable non-resident workers, except workers offshore and seamen on ships, who have a salary below bracket tax level 3 (for the 2023 income year, the maximum amount is NOK 644,700; for 2024, the maximum amount is NOK 670,000). The rate is a flat 25% rate (includes social security contributions). Where PAYE applies, deductions are not applicable.
If PAYE applies, the workers are not in need of an individual tax return. The tax is final at payment and is, therefore, not subject to change.
Where an individual is tax liable to Norway only a part of the income year, the income is annualised. The same applies for certain deductions (i.e. personal deduction and minimum deduction, *see the [Deductions](norway/individual/deductions.html) section*).
The Norwegian income tax system for individuals is based on a dual tax base system: general income and personal income.
## General income tax
General income is taxed at a flat rate of 22%. The general income tax base comprises all categories of taxable income (i.e. income from employment, business, and capital). Tax allowances, expenses, and certain losses are deductible when computing general income. The taxes on general income are the county tax, the municipal tax (Norway is divided into 11 counties and subdivided into 356 municipalities), and the state tax.
## Bracket tax on personal income
Personal income between NOK 208,051 and NOK 292,850 is subject to a bracket tax of 1.7%. For personal income between NOK 292,851 and NOK 670,000, the bracket tax rate is 4.0%. For personal income between NOK 670,001 and NOK 937,900, the bracket tax rate is 13.6%. For personal income between NOK 937,901 and NOK 1,350,000, the bracket tax rate is 16.6%. For income exceeding NOK 1,350,000, the bracket tax rate is 17.6%. The personal income tax base comprises income mainly from employment, including benefits in kind, and pensions, as well as income from a self-proprietorship and certain remuneration from partnerships.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
## Taxable period
The income tax year normally runs from 1 January to 31 December, with assessments being issued no later than 1 December in the following calendar year. Companies are liable for both advance payments and final settlements in the calendar year of assessment. Companies with a financial year other than the calendar year may use the financial year for tax purposes in certain instances (e.g. if they belong to a foreign group with a deviating accounting year, they may also use the financial year of the group for tax purposes).
## Tax returns
Companies are, in general, required to file their tax returns electronically by the end of May in the year following their financial year. Upon application, an extension until the end of June to file the tax return will normally be granted. The tax returns are obligatory for all corporate taxpayers. Additional requirements may apply for specific business sectors, such as hydro power production. Under the petroleum tax regime, the filing deadline is the end of April.
The taxpayer is responsible for reporting the taxable income in the tax return, which will be the basis for the tax assessment. The taxpayer can voluntarily change information given in the tax return for up to three years after the filing deadline.
## Payment of tax
Companies are required to make advance payments of tax on 15 February and 15 April in the year following the income year. The two payments should together cover all of the expected CIT to be assessed but could be complemented by an additional payment by 31 May of the year following the income year to avoid interest on any remaining tax balance. If the remaining tax balance is not paid by 31 May of the year following the income year, the company will receive an invoice from the tax authorities that is due for payment three weeks after the assessment has been made public (approximately in September/October of the year following the relevant accounting year).
The above applies to all corporate taxpayers, except for taxpayers under the petroleum tax regime, where tax shall be paid in six instalments.
## Tax audit process
The Norwegian tax system is tax return based. The Norwegian tax office carries out tax audits based on different selection criterions. A tax audit can be caused by a review of the tax return, random selection of companies or business sectors, information obtained from other parties, etc.
The tax office normally gives notice of an upcoming tax audit, but it can also be unannounced. The examination generally takes place by formal, written communication, and the process can take from a few weeks to several years.
In general, a reassessment of the tax assessment requires a notice from the tax authorities with a reasonable timeframe for the taxpayer to give a reply to the notified amendments.
## Statute of limitations
The general reassessment period is five years (starting from the year after the income year in question). A ten-year limit applies in cases where the taxpayer has demonstrated gross negligence.
The taxpayer may file an appeal on the resolutions made by the tax authorities within six weeks after they were sent to the taxpayer. The time limit for appealing other decisions is normally three weeks after the tax office’s decision. This applies both under the new and previous rule set.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Social security contributions
The Social Security Law deals with the various benefits from and payments to the National Insurance Scheme.
The scheme is financed by the individual's and employer's social security contributions in addition to grants from the state and the municipalities. The individual's contribution is charged at a higher rate for self-employed persons (11%) than for employees (7.8%). The employer's contribution (14.1%) must be paid with respect to salaries, etc. The rates are determined by the Parliament in the annual decrees on contributions to the National Insurance Scheme.
Social security contributions are levied on the ‘personal income’ base.
### Employee's contribution
The following conditions apply to both employed and self-employed individuals:
The individual's contribution is not deductible for their tax purposes.
### Employer's contribution
The employer must also make social security contributions. The contribution is based on total Norwegian gross salary (and taxable benefit) costs. The employer’s contribution is levied at a rate of 14.1% but could be lower when the employer is established in certain sparsely populated areas. The employer share increases 5% (meaning a total rate of 19.1%) for income exceeding NOK 850,000 (NOK 750,000 in 2023).
Social security agreements may exempt the employer from this tax *(see the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](norway/individual/foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for a list of countries with which social security agreements exist*). If a similar social security contribution is paid to another state based on the same salaries, etc., then a credit may be applied for against the employer's Norwegian social security costs.
The employer's contribution is deductible for tax purposes of the employer insofar as the wages to which it relates are deductible.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a tax on sales. It is due to be paid when sales of goods and taxable services are taking place at all stages in the chain of distribution within Norway. VAT is also levied on imports.
The expenses (actual costs) are included in the following VAT rates:
## Wealth taxes
Individuals pay both municipal wealth tax and state wealth tax.
The municipal wealth tax rate is 0.7% and is calculated based on assets exceeding a net capital tax basis of NOK 1.7 million for single/not married taxpayers and NOK 3.4 million for married couples.
The state wealth tax rate is 0.3% and is calculated based on assets exceeding a net capital tax basis of NOK 1.7 million for single/not married taxpayers and NOK 3.4 million for married couples. For 2022, a new step for the state rate is introduced. For net wealth in excess of NOK 20 million (NOK 40 million for married couples), the rate is 0.4%.
Thus, the maximum wealth tax rate is 1.1%.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance and gift tax was removed as of 1 January 2014.
## Property taxes
## Possible changes in exit taxation
On 20 March 2024, the Ministry of Finance issued a proposal for consultation regarding the amendment of the rules on the taxation of capital gains, etc. upon emigration. The proposed rules entail that individuals moving from Norway will be subject to an exit tax, which is to be paid in full upon emigration, in instalments over 12 years, or in full after 12 years. The rules have an uncertain aspect in relation to EEA law and could severely impact heirs. The consultation deadline expired on 21 May 2024, and the hearing is currently marked as not yet concluded.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
Norway is a country in Northern Europe occupying the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The capital city of Norway is Oslo. Norwegian is the official language of Norway, and the Norwegian krone (NOK) is the currency.
Norway has a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy type of government, wherein the King is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government. Norway's well-established monarchy has had an uninterrupted chain of successors to the throne since 1905, and is currently led by King Harald V.
In 1949, Norway became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The discovery of petroleum in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the European Union (EU). However, Norway is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA).
The Norwegian government controls key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector and the major hydropower producers, through large-scale, publicly-majority-owned enterprises.
Norway is richly endowed with natural resources, such as petroleum, hydro power, fish, forests, and minerals, and is highly dependent on the oil and gas sector, which accounts for approximately half of the total value of Norway’s exports of goods. Norway is the world's third largest exporter of natural gas and one of the world's largest oil exporters.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to increase by 0.8% in 2024.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The general VAT rate is 25% and applies to all supplies of goods and services not qualifying for another rate or an exemption.
A reduced rate of 15% applies to supply of food and beverages, excluding tobacco, alcohol, medication, and water from waterworks. The reduced rate is not applicable to the supply of food and beverages consumed in restaurants and other food establishments.
Further, a reduced VAT rate of 12% applies to domestic passenger transport services and procurement of such services, domestic ferry services related to transport of vehicles, accommodation services, cinema tickets, museum and gallery tickets, amusement park tickets, and sports events.
Exemptions with credit (zero-rated) include, but are not limited to, the following (please note that there might be specific conditions for the exemptions to apply):
Exemptions without credit include, but are not limited to, the following (please note that there might be specific conditions for the exemptions to apply):
Input VAT on purchases used in VAT liable activity is, as a starting point, deductible. However, please note that there are limitations on the right to deduct certain costs even if used in VAT liable activity, including, but not limited to (note that certain conditions and exceptions might apply), the following:
Businesses and public enterprises shall be liable to register in the VAT Register once the sum of VAT liable supplies and withdrawals exceeds NOK 50,000 during a 12-month period. The threshold for charitable and benevolent institutions and organisations is NOK 140,000.
Exemptions, whereby an option to tax is available, include the letting of immovable property to VAT-liable lessees following a specific VAT registration with the VAT authorities. Please note that an ordinary VAT-registered business is not required to specifically register for letting of property. The same registration thresholds apply.
The registration threshold is met when supplies subject to VAT in accordance with the Norwegian VAT legislation (including self-supplies) exceed NOK 50,000 during a 12-month period. For charitable and public utility institutions and organisations, the threshold is NOK 140,000.
As of April 2020, a simplified VAT registration scheme is applicable for B2C sales of goods with a value below NOK 3,000 per item (VAT on E-Commerce or VOEC). The scheme is not applicable to foodstuffs and goods that are subject to excise duties. A similar simplified registration scheme also applies to B2C supplies of electronic services (VOES). None of the simplified registration schemes entitles deduction of input VAT.
As of January 2023, the simplified VAT registration scheme has been extended to include all remotely deliverable services.
As of January 2024, the Norwegian Tax Administration has developed a new solution for VOEC, which replaces the old solution in Altinn. The existing data from the old solution will be migrated to the new portal. The temporary customs declaration exemption for consignments valued below NOK 350 will be abolished.
## Customs duties
There are quite extensive customs duties on agricultural products and foodstuffs, which must be paid upon importation. However, it is often possible to avoid customs duties on these products partly or completely by applying for an exemption from the agricultural authorities in advance. Some of these exemptions are subject to tariff quotas.
Clothes and some other textile products are also subject to customs duties upon importation to Norway, but imports comprised by free trade agreements (such as the EEA with the EU) and the General System of Preferences (for developing countries) are exempt. As a result, clothes will, as a general rule, not be subject to customs duties as long as the importer presents valid proof of origin.
There are no customs duties on other products than agricultural products, foodstuffs, clothes, and textile products.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are calculated on import and domestic production of the following:
There are also excise taxes related to the following:
## Property taxes
Real estate may, under certain conditions, be subject to property tax. It is up to the different municipalities to choose whether it wants to impose property tax on real estate. Not all municipalities impose property tax on real estate. The applicable rate varies between 0.1% and 0.7%, which is decided by the municipality. The tax base will normally be the estimated market value (with some adjustments). The maximum rate for property tax on private residences and leisure properties is 0.4%.
Production equipment and production installations are exempt from property tax from 2019, with a seven-year transitional period.
Hydropower producers must pay property tax on the hydropower plant’s capitalised value using a capital interest rate of 4.5%. However, the basis for the calculation of the property tax should fall in the range of NOK 0.95 to NOK 2.74 per kWh of the power plant average production for the last seven years. For hydropower plants with nominal capacity less than 10,000 kVA, the property tax base will be the same as the tax value for income tax purposes.
## Stamp taxes
A tax is levied on the registration of a change of ownership of real estate. The tax is calculated at 2.5% of the fair market value.
## Net wealth taxes
There is no net wealth tax or other capital taxes for limited companies, investment funds, state-owned enterprises (according to the State-owned Enterprise Act), inter-municipal companies, and companies in which somebody owns a part in or receives income from, when the responsibility for the companies’ liabilities is limited to the companies’ capital.
Some institutional holders (e.g. mutual insurance companies, savings banks, co-operatives, taxable pension funds, self-owned finance institutions, mortgage credit associations) pay 0.3% (state) net wealth tax.
As of the income year 2024, shares in quoted limited companies and equity funds are valued at 80% of quoted value as of 1 January of the year after the relevant income year for net wealth tax purposes. If quoted both on the Norwegian and a foreign stock exchange, the Norwegian stock exchange value will be applicable. If not quoted, the basis for taxation is, as a rule, the company’s net taxable value for wealth tax purposes as of 1 January of the income year in question. The basis for taxation of non-quoted shares in foreign companies is, as a starting point, the assumed market value of the shares as of 1 January of the assessment year.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than national insurance contributions and financial activities tax (*see below*).
## National insurance contributions
Employers are subject to pay employers' national insurance contributions on the employees’ gross salary. The employers’ contribution rate varies between 0% and 14.1% based on the municipality of the head office of the business. The contribution shall be reported and paid on a bimonthly basis.
## Financial activities tax
Entities within the financial services sector are, in general, subject to a special payroll tax. The tax rate is 5% and shall be calculated on the wage base. Companies where the employees use more than 30% of their time on financial services exempt from VAT will be comprised by the tax
## Exit tax
The exit rules levy taxes upon the migration of assets or liabilities. The tax is calculated by reference to the accrued but unrealised gains at the time of migration at a rate of 22% (25%).
Exit tax is also levied if Norwegian CFC taxation lapses because the control requirement is no longer met or if:
Transfer of assets or liabilities from a PE of a Norwegian company to another PE in a country where the DTT in question is based on the credit method is, however, not regarded as a taxable event.
Assets being transferred out of Norwegian taxing jurisdiction are considered as taxable events, but the tax charge may be deferred if certain conditions are met. The main conditions are that the taxpayer is resident within the EEA/EU and has provided a guarantee for the deferred tax and interest charge.
## Carbon dioxide (CO2) tax
A CO2 tax is calculated on petroleum that is flared and on natural gas emitted into the air, as well as on CO2 that is separated from petroleum and emitted into the air, and on installations used for production or transportation of petroleum. The petroleum included in the CO2 tax is mineral oil, petrol, gas, natural gas, and LPG.
The CO2 tax is regarded as a normal operating cost for CIT purposes and is a fully deductible cost both for corporate and special tax calculations

| Petrol | 2.72 |
| Mineral oil: |  |

## Natural resource tax
Hydropower activities are subject to a natural resource tax of NOK 0.013 per kWh as determined based on 1/7 of the produced kWh for the income year in question and the six previous years. The natural resource tax is creditable against the standard CIT.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
A Norwegian resident company is, as a starting point, subject to corporate income tax (CIT) on its worldwide income. Non-resident companies are, as a starting point, liable for CIT in Norway when engaged in a business that is either conducted in or managed from Norway.
CIT is, in general, assessed at a rate of 22%. Certain companies within the financial sector are assessed at a CIT rate of 25%.
As a general rule, income is taxable when the right to receive it arises and costs are deductible when the liability to cover the costs arises. The actual payment is generally not relevant.
## Petroleum tax regime
All upstream petroleum activity on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) is taxable to Norway.
Taxation is based on net income at a marginal tax rate of 78%, which comprises the ordinary 22% CIT rate and a 56% special tax. All income is subject to 22% CIT, while only income from offshore production and pipeline transportation of petroleum on the NCS (offshore tax regime) is subject to the additional 56% special tax.
Following the 2022 shift to a ‘sequential’ tax system, tax on upstream petroleum tax activities is calculated in two steps. Firstly, the tax in the ordinary 22% tax base is calculated. The resulting tax amount is then deducted from the special tax base, on which a ‘technical special tax rate’ of 71.8% is applied in order for the overall effective tax rate to remain 78%:
Example:
| Income subject to 78% tax = 100 | |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary CIT: | 100 \* 22% = **22** |
| Special tax base: | 100 - 22 = 78 |
| Special tax: | 78 \* 71.8% = **56** |
| Total tax: | 22 + 56 = **78** |
All upstream activity on the NCS must be consolidated within the company. There is no ring fence per oil field, and tax consolidation against other activity is limited.
Crude oil sales from most of the fields are taxed at a predetermined market price set by an official board (i.e., the ‘norm price’). In theory, a norm price may be imposed on gas sales, but this has not been implemented in practice. A company may apply for a binding ruling for pricing of inter-company sales of gas, but not many companies have used this opportunity. The pricing of inter-company sales of gas must be in accordance with the arm’s length principle.
Under the Petroleum Tax Act, investments on the NCS can be deducted in the year of investment in the special tax base (i.e., against 71.8% tax). In the ordinary 22% tax base, the same investments must be depreciated on a linear basis over six years.
The tax value of losses (both exploration losses and other losses) in the special tax base (71.8%) is refunded by the Norwegian State as a general loss refund. The general loss refund for Year 1 is paid as a cash payment part of the ordinary tax settlement, i.e. in Year 2. The loss refund can be pledged as security for external financing.
The ordinary CIT value of losses (6.2%) is not refunded. It must be carried forward without interest. For companies in the closing down phase, there is a risk that this tax value will never be recovered.
Special rules apply as to the deductibility of net interest costs in the special tax basis.
A special regime ensures that transfer of licences on NCS is tax exempt; there is no step up in the tax basis.
Note that dividends that stem from income subject to the special tax regime are exempted from dividend withholding tax (WHT).
The Oil Taxation Office (OTO) has a special responsibility for the taxation of the petroleum sector. Generally, the OTO has a high focus on transfer pricing.
As part of the financial measures for Norwegian businesses in relation to the COVID-19 situation, temporary amendments to the upstream petroleum tax regime were made for 2020 and 2021. These amendments continue to be effective for investment costs incurred in subsequent years to the extent such costs are part of a Plan for Development and Operation (PDO) or a Plan for Installation and Operation (PIO) (or application for exemption from such Plan) submitted by year-end 2022 and approved by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy by year-end 2023. The amendments will apply for costs incurred until the start of production.
## Hydropower tax regime
The hydropower tax regime applies to income derived from the production of hydroelectric power in plants having an installed nominal capacity of 10,000 kVA.
Net income from the production of hydroelectric power is taxable both at the ordinary 22% CIT rate and at a 57.7% resource rent tax. The ordinary CIT is deductible in the basis for the calculation of the resource rent tax, resulting in an overall marginal tax rate of 67%.
The resource rent is calculated per hydro power plant. The gross income is, with some exceptions, calculated as the annual spot market price per hour multiplied by the plant’s actual power production. Actual income from power sold under certain standardised long-term power purchasing agreements (PPAs) are, however, recognised for resource rent purposes. In addition, actual income from green certificates and certificates of origin is included. Generally, expenses related to the power plant are deductible, with the exception of interest costs, which are non-deductible for resource rent purposes.
For resource rent purposes, investments in hydropower plants are deducted according to special rules. Investments made after 1 January 2021 may be fully deducted in the year in which they are made. Investments made before this date are depreciated according to separate rules. Rent expenditure and depreciation related to waterfalls are never deductible.
Tax consolidation is mandatory within each hydropower producing company and is available on a group level provided the conditions for group taxation are met. Losses (negative resource rent) on a company level (eventually on a group level) will be compensated by the Norwegian state.
## Shipping tonnage tax regime
The tonnage tax rules in Norway are generally in line with those found in other European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries and imply that shipping income will be tax-exempt on a permanent basis. On 14 December 2017, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) announced that the Norwegian tonnage tax regime is approved for a new ten-year period, with certain amendments.
Norwegian tonnage-taxed companies are allowed to keep only certain kinds of assets inside the tonnage regime (legal assets) and are not allowed to have income from non-tonnage-taxed activities except some financial income. If the requirements are not fulfilled, the company will fall outside the scope of the model and be taxed at the ordinary rate (22%).
### **Qualifying assets**
A tonnage-taxed company must own at least one qualifying asset (i.e. a vessel, for example bulk tankers, container vessels, car carriers, tugboats, and entrepreneurial vessels and auxiliary vessels for use in the petroleum industry), new building contracts, a 3% share in another tonnage-taxed limited company, or a 3% ownership interest in a qualifying partnership or controlled foreign company (CFC).
One of the important amendments from the ESA announced in December 2017 relates to the inclusion of windmill farm entrepreneurial vessels to the regime. More precisely, this means that vessels engaged in the construction, maintenance, repair, and disassembly of windmills at sea are eligible under the scheme as of the income year 2017.
Non-self-propelled barges are eligible for the tonnage tax regime with effect from 1 January 2018, provided certain conditions are met.
### **Qualifying and legal business activities/income**
Qualifying business income is income from the operation of the company’s own and chartered vessels. There are limitations on chartering out vessels on bareboat. The limitations on bareboat chartering out in the approved regime are different for vessels in the offshore sector and vessels outside the offshore sector (traditional shipping).
The following limitations apply for bareboat chartering out in the offshore sector:
On bareboat chartering out outside the offshore sector, a distinction must be made between contracts regarded as operational lease and financial lease.
Chartering out on contracts regarded as financial lease are not permitted under the regime.
Bareboat contracts regarded as operational lease are allowed with the following limitations:
For both the offshore sector and traditional shipping, the share of allowed bareboat chartering out is measured on group level.
The limitations on bareboat chartering out will not apply to existing contracts that are not regarded as long-term. The assessment of what constitutes a long-term contract are different in and outside the offshore sector. Further, a transitional period will be implemented for the companies subject to the updated rules.
Chartering in of vessels on time-charter terms is limited to 90% of non-EEA flagged vessels. These rules are not applicable for existing time-charter contracts.
Furthermore, gains upon disposal of vessels and new building contracts are exempt from taxation.
Income from related activities, such as the sale of goods and services onboard vessels, loading and discharging vessels, or leasing out containers and operations of ticket offices, is also exempt from taxation. The exemption also applies to income from the strategic and commercial management of the company’s owned and chartered vessels, as well as vessels owned or operated by group companies (more than 50% joint ownership), and vessels operated according to a pool agreement. Pure management companies are not included (i.e. all companies must have at least one qualifying asset).
Financial income is permitted, except for income from shares in unlisted companies and ownership interests in partnerships that are not taxed under the tonnage tax system. The condition is that financial activities do not constitute a separate business. Net financial income is subject to ordinary taxation (22%). Currency gains and losses are partly taxable/deductible, and interest costs are partly deductible, depending on the proportion between the company’s finance capital and total book capital.
### **Withholding tax (WHT)**
Norway has domestic legal authority to impose royalty WHT at 15% on payment to related parties in low-tax jurisdictions. The 15% WHT also applies to lease payments for ships and other physical assets paid to related parties resident in low-tax jurisdictions.
Payments from Norwegian tonnage taxed companies are, however, exempt from the royalty WHT rule.
### **Entrance into the tonnage tax system**
Entry into the tonnage tax system is optional and may take place with effect from 1 January every year, provided that the company has fulfilled the conditions for the application into the tonnage tax system from the beginning of the year. Newly established companies will have direct entry and may enter into the tonnage tax system with an effective date from the date of incorporation. All qualifying companies within the same group are obligated to make the same election (tonnage taxation or ordinary taxation). The election is made in the corporate tax return filing.
Companies that enter into the tonnage tax system are subject to a formal ten-year lock-in period. If a company exits the tonnage tax system before the lock-in period expires, it will be excluded from the tonnage tax system until after the initial lock-in period has ended.
Upon entry into the tonnage tax system, the difference between market value and tax value of the company’s assets (including vessels, new building contracts, ownership interests in partnerships, and shares in CFCs/tax exempt assets) is taxed as a capital gain (22%) that can be transferred to the gain and loss account. 20% of the balance will be entered as income each year (balance method). There is continuity for financial assets and assets covered by the tax-exemption rules (qualifying shares and derivatives).
### **Exit from the tonnage tax system**
A shipping company may exit the regime on a voluntary basis or may be obligated to do so after breaching specific company requirements within the tonnage tax system. There is no specific exit charge when leaving the regime, and the tax value on the company’s assets will be adjusted to market value at the time of exit. However, a company that has untaxed gains calculated upon entry into the tonnage tax system could have a tax liability upon exit.
## Local income taxes
There is no county or municipal CIT in Norway.

## Implementation of Pillar Two in Norway
## Onshore wind power taxation
As of 1 January 2024, Norway has introduced resource rent tax on onshore wind power production. This entails that net income from the production of wind power is taxable both at the ordinary 22% corporate income tax (CIT) rate and, in addition, at a 25% effective rate of resource rent tax (effective marginal tax rate of 47%).
The income computation for the resource rent tax is based on the hydropower regime. As a main rule, the gross resource rent income is determined as spot market prices per hour x actual power production. The actual power prices obtained will, however, be recognised, *inter alia*, where the power is sold pursuant to existing power purchase agreements (PPAs) concluded with unrelated parties before 28 September 2022 or PPAs concluded with unrelated parties after 28 September 2022 that satisfy certain conditions. In addition, the gross resource rent will include income from the sale of electricity certificates and guarantees of origin.
Deductions in the resource rent income are granted, notably, for ordinary operating expenses, capital expenditure (with separate rules for historical and future investments, cf. below), real property taxes, and a simulated CIT calculated on the activity that is subject to resource rent tax. Financing costs are non-deductible in the resource rent.
Deductions for capital expenditure are subject to separate rules for historical and future investments in onshore wind power assets. While future investments are fully deductible in the year of investment (cash flow taxation), historical investments are subject to transitional rules for calculating the tax values upon entry into the new regime and annual depreciation.
For existing wind farms, negative resource rent income may be carried forward with a risk-free interest. For new wind farms, the tax value of negative resource rent income will be paid out to the taxpayer subject to the Norwegian tax authorities having controlled the tax assessment (subject to approval from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority before taking effect).
In addition, as of 1 January 2024, onshore wind power is subject to a production tax (excise duty) levied at a rate of 0.023 Norwegian kroner (NOK) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity produced.
## Resource rent tax on aquaculture
Resource rent tax on aquaculture was introduced in September 2022 with effect from 1 January 2023 and approved by Parliament on 31 May 2023. The effective tax rate of 25% applies to the production of salmon, trout, and rainbow trout in the sea phase, and implies a marginal tax rate of 47%. A tax-free allowance of NOK 70 million is granted at the corporate group level, making the smallest companies exempt from the resource rent taxation. The group definition includes companies with decisive influence over another enterprise by agreement as well as companies owned by related-party individuals. The tax-free allowance of NOK 70 million must be adjusted by the CIT rate of 22%, resulting in a net allowance of NOK 54.6 million.
The resource rent tax is structured as a cash-flow tax, meaning revenues and costs are included in the tax basis in the year in which they are earned or incurred. Revenues are based on the market value of the fish at the time the fish are removed from the cages. From July 2024, an independent price board will be established to determine the market value/taxable income based on extensive reporting by the companies. For 2023, and the first six months of 2024, companies are responsible for determining the market values themselves.
Companies subject to the resource rent tax can immediately deduct investments used exclusively during the sea phase. Deductions for investments made prior to 1 January 2023 are granted through deprecation of remaining tax values. Accordingly, there is no step-up in tax basis or other compensation for historical investments according to the tax authorities, but this is expected to be challenged by taxpayers.
Negative resource rent income can be carried forward with interest and deducted from positive calculated resource rent income in subsequent years. The tax-free allowance cannot be used to generate a loss. If activities cease, the tax value of the negative resource rent will be disbursed.
No deductions are granted for the value of fish farming licences, but a stipulated deduction is permitted for licences purchased at auction in 2018/2020 and allocated at fixed prices in 2020. The deduction is set at 40% of the actual remuneration paid to the central government divided over five years.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
All companies that are incorporated under Norwegian company law are, as a general rule, regarded as tax resident in Norway and taxable in Norway on their worldwide income. Companies incorporated under Norwegian company law that are considered tax resident in another country under an applicable tax treaty between Norway and that other country will not be treated as tax resident in Norway.
Foreign corporations are regarded as tax resident in Norway if the *de facto* management of the company is carried out in Norway. When assessing whether *de facto* management is carried out in Norway, one must consider where management at board level and daily management are exercised. Other circumstances concerning the organisation and the business of the company may be relevant in an overall assessment where the management functions are split and carried out in different jurisdictions.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under Norwegian domestic law, a foreign company is liable to tax in Norway when engaged in a business that is either conducted in or managed from Norway. The tax liability is limited to income that is derived from Norwegian activity. As a general rule, non-residents without a PE are not liable for tax on capital gains when selling Norwegian financial instruments. However, if the financial instrument is connected to a business that is conducted in or managed from Norway, a sale of financial instruments can trigger taxation in Norway.
The domestic legislation does not include a reference to the treaty concepts of 'permanent establishment' or 'permanent representative'. The threshold for tax liability is normally lower under Norwegian domestic law than the taxing right afforded to source states under double tax treaties (DTTs).
With respect to DTTs, the Norwegian tax authorities will, to a large extent, follow the OECD Commentaries when interpreting the relevant DTT, provided the wording is similar to the OECD Model Tax Convention.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
## Depreciation
In Norway, the declining-balance method of depreciation is mandatory for most capitalised assets. The depreciation rates given below are the maximum rates.
There is a duty to capitalise an asset that has a value of NOK 30,000 or higher and an economic life of at least three years.
| Asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Office equipment machines, etc. (asset group a) | 30 |
| Acquired goodwill/business value (asset group b) | 20 |
| Heavy goods vehicles, lorries, buses, vans, taxis, and vehicles for persons with disabilities (asset group c) | 24 |
| Passenger cars, tractors, machinery, tools, instruments, fixtures and furniture, etc. (asset group d) | 20 |
| Ships, vessels, offshore rigs, etc. (asset group e) | 14 |
| Aircraft, helicopters (asset group f) | 12 |
| Transmission and distribution facilities for electric power and electrical equipment in power plants (asset group g) | 5 |
| Buildings and construction, hotels, hostels, inns, etc. (asset group h) | 4/6/10/20 (1) |
| Office buildings (asset group i) | 2 |
| Fixed technical installations in buildings (e.g. heating, cooling and freezing installations, electrical installation, sanitary installations, elevators). (asset group j) | 10 |
Notes
1. 1. Livestock housing construction in agriculture can be depreciated at a rate of 6%. The applicable rate is 10% if, from the date of its erection, the structure has an economic life of 20 years or less. Costs for the establishment of fruit and berry fields can be depreciated as facilities at 10% and 20%, respectively, annually.
Special depreciation rules apply to assets moved in and out of Norwegian jurisdiction to and from companies resident outside the European Economic Area.
## Goodwill
Acquired goodwill may be amortised according to the declining-balance method at up to 20% *per annum*. Tax authorities have, however, in some cases questioned an allocation to goodwill and claimed that a part of the purchase price should be allocated to intellectual property (IP), concessions, etc. Intangibles other than goodwill are amortisable (on a linear basis) only if they are subject to an evident loss in value (impairment test) or if they are time-limited.
## Start-up expenses
In general, start-up expenses are deductible, provided that the costs are borne by the company. Start-up costs could include costs related to registration in the Register of Business Enterprises, lawyers and accountant fees, drafting articles of association and shareholders agreement, etc.
## Interest expenses
In general, interest expenses are deductible.
## Bad debts
In general, receivables are tax deductible if the debt is clearly irrecoverable or realised (e.g. if the receivable is sold to a third party, converted to share capital, or waived) and is sufficiently connected to the company’s business (the business requirement). For accounts receivables, a calculated rate multiplied by the total account receivables at year-end may be deducted. The rate is calculated based on the two preceding years losses on such receivables multiplied by a fixed rate set by the Ministry of Finance.
Losses on receivables between group companies (with more than 90% direct or indirect mutual ownership of shares) and partnerships are, as a main rule, not tax deductible. However, trade receivables and losses on receivables created in connection with mergers or demergers are deductible for tax purposes. The Ministry of Finance has published a proposal to disregard trading receivables between group companies where the receivable has been outstanding for more than 12 months. The proposal is subject to a public hearing, ending 5 August 2024.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to certain charitable institutions are tax deductible. The upper limit for the tax deduction per year is NOK 25,000. The donation must at least correspond to an amount of NOK 500 per charity. Donations exceeding NOK 10,000 must be paid via bank transfers to be tax deductible. The same limit applies to individuals and companies. The receiving entity must be pre-approved by the Norwegian tax authorities.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are normally not tax deductible. This also applies to some administrative charges that are penal in nature. Charges that have no statutory basis in Norwegian law may be tax deductible, provided that the general conditions are fulfilled.
## Taxes
Real estate tax, as well as foreign income and capital taxes paid by the taxpayer, are deductible when determining corporate income. Foreign taxes derived from income that is taxable in Norway are deductible only if they have not been credited against Norwegian tax payable.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward indefinitely. Losses incurred in the year of ceasing business may be carried back for a period of two years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
Income taxes are assessed on companies individually, not on a consolidated basis. Limited group relief is secured by the possibility of group contributions between Norwegian companies, provided common group direct or indirect (including foreign) ownership and voting rights is more than 90%. Furthermore, the Norwegian group contribution rules are, under certain conditions, also applicable to Norwegian branches of foreign companies that are resident within the European Economic Area. Note that group contributions are not deductible for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities subject to the Petroleum Tax Act.
Assets may, pursuant to the Group Regulations, be transferred tax-free between group companies at tax book value for tax purposes and at market value for financial book purposes. However, a guarantee for the latent tax liability created by the transfer must be provided upon request by the tax authorities.
Payment must equal market value of the assets transferred. The same applies to payment in the form of shares. If the transferee loses the affiliation with the tax group while still owning the transferred assets, the transferor will be taxed for the difference between the tax book value and the market value of the assets.
## Transfer pricing
In Norway, the arm’slength principle for related-party transactions is incorporated into the Tax Act. The transfer pricing provision of the Tax Act states that the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 'shall be taken into account' when addressing transfer pricing issues under Norwegian tax law.
Transfer pricing has increasingly become the focus of the tax authorities’ attention in recent years. It is fairly common for the Norwegian tax authorities to choose test cases that are subject to substantial investment. During the most recent years, focus has been on, *inter alia*, business restructuring, services, cost contribution arrangements, and the financing of operations.
Norway does not have a general, unilateral advance pricing agreement (APA) regime. Bilateral and multilateral APAs are available under the relevant DTTs. It is also becoming more common to discuss complex cases with the tax authorities on a non-binding basis in advance of implementation or before assessment. However, there are no particular Norwegian safe harbour rules or any other official guidance on how to price specific transactions, etc.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Norway has implemented CbC reporting rules for multinational groups with an overall income of NOK 6.5 billion or more. The report is to be submitted, at the latest, by 31 December of the year after the relevant accounting year. For multinational groups with divergent accounting years, the deadline is 12 months after the end of the accounting year.
## Thin capitalisation, etc.
There is no general fixed debt-to-equity ratio requirement in Norwegian tax law, but general interest limitation rules apply (*see below*). For companies that are part of a group, adjustments to deductible interest costs may be made under the arm’s length principle. Generally, such adjustments may be made if the company has obtained a larger loan from a group company than an independent credit institution would have granted, or if the agreed level of interest is higher than an independent credit institution would have required. Naturally, this analysis will vary based on the actual company’s financial capacity and its creditworthiness, which depends on several elements, such as the nature of the business, financial status, future income possibilities, financial guarantees, group relationships, etc. As such, there is no applicable 'safe harbour'. The company must also be able to service its debts. Typically, a thin capitalisation challenge from the tax authorities will be based on comparisons of key ratios indicating the company’s debt servicing capacity.
If a Norwegian entity is regarded as being thinly capitalised, part of the entity’s interest and debts may be reclassified to equity.
## Interest deduction limitation
Interest expenses are, as a starting point, deductible for Norwegian tax purposes. There are, however, rules on interest deduction limitations on both internal and external interest in place, which are in line with the OECD G20 BEPS project. The rules on deduction limitation on interest to related parties apply to both stand-alone companies and group companies, while the deduction limitation rules on external interest only apply to companies that are consolidated into a group financial statement in the year before the income year or could have been consolidated under IFRS.
### **Threshold**
The rules apply if the threshold is exceeded. For stand-alone companies, the threshold is net NOK 5 million. For entities that are considered as group companies, the threshold is net NOK 25 million combined for all Norwegian entities consolidated into the same group. The threshold is measured at the end of the year, and all interest expenses, both to related parties and external parties, should be included.
### **Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rule**
The maximum deduction in each company is 25% of tax EBITDA. The portion of net interest expenses that exceed 25% of tax EBITDA may be carried forward for ten years. In practice, the carryforward period is longer due to the old interest being deducted first within the deduction frame, while interest in the current tax year is added to the carryforward balance.
### **Equity escape clause**
Group companies may utilise the equity escape clause and deduct all interest expenses to related and external parties if it can be demonstrated that the equity ratio at the company level or for the Norwegian part of the group is no more than 2 percentage points lower compared to the equity ratio in the globally consolidated Group.
The equity ratio is calculated based on the year-end accounts of the year prior to the tax year. ​
In order to compare the equity ratios, certain adjustments must be made to the accounts of the Norwegian entities to ensure comparability.
### **Interest expenses to related parties outside the group**
Norway has a separate rule on interest expenses to related parties outside the group, where, if a group company has such interest expenses, it is subject to the NOK 5 million threshold and 25% of tax-EBITDA rule. A related party outside the group will typically be an individual who holds, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the shares in the company. Consequently, a Norwegian company belonging to a group and qualifying for the equity escape clause may still be exposed to the interest deduction limitation to the extent it has debt to a related party outside the group.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Norwegian residents are taxed directly on their allocable part of the profits from a CFC’s income if the foreign company is resident in a low-tax country, irrespective of whether income is distributed to the Norwegian investor. A low-tax country, in this respect, is a country where the effective foreign income taxation of the company’s profits is less than two-thirds of the effective taxation that would have been due had the company been resident in Norway. A condition for such taxation is that 50% or more of the foreign company’s shares or capital is held or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Norwegian taxpayers (alone or together), based on the status at the beginning and end of the income year in question.
Note that if Norwegian taxpayers own or control more than 60% of the shares or capital in a foreign company at the end of the income year, Norwegian control exists irrespective of the level of control at the beginning of the year. Norwegian control ceases to exist if Norwegian taxpayers own or control less than 50% of the shares or capital at both the beginning and end of the income year or less than 40% of the shares or capital at the end of the income year.
On the condition that Norway has signed a tax treaty with the country where the CFC is resident, and the foreign company in question is covered by the treaty, the CFC rules will be applicable only if the income of the entity in question is mainly of a passive nature. Furthermore, CFC taxation will also not apply if the foreign company in question is resident in a low-tax jurisdiction within the European Economic Area and is not deemed as a wholly artificial arrangement as outlined in the ECJ’s decision in the Cadbury Schweppes case. Hence, CFC taxation will be avoided for EEA companies that fulfil certain substance requirements.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
Branch income is taxed at the corporate rate of 22% (25% for certain entities within the financial sector), i.e. the same as Norwegian companies. The basis for taxation is gross income less deductible costs. Both direct and indirect costs related to the activities carried out in Norway may be deductible.
There is no branch profit tax or other repatriation taxes. However, if assets and/or liabilities are transferred from a PE in Norway to the head office or another foreign PE of the same company, this may trigger exit taxation. The transfer of assets to another corporate entity is subject to regular taxation.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Norwegian limited companies that have paid taxes on foreign-source income may, under certain conditions, offset the Norwegian tax paid against the foreign tax paid. A tax credit cannot be claimed if the income has been recognised by a PE of the Norwegian company and the tax treaty between Norway and the state of the PE prescribes avoidance of double taxation by exemption.
The tax credit is limited to the lower of the Norwegian tax paid on the same type of foreign income and the foreign tax actually paid. It is possible to carry forward unused foreign taxes for up to a maximum of five years. It is not possible to claim a tax credit for foreign tax paid in addition to claiming deductions in the taxable income in Norway for the same foreign tax paid. The tax credit rules are very technical, and it should be noted that there are two different 'baskets' of income, one basket for income subject to ‘ordinary’ taxation abroad and one basket for income that has been taxed in low-tax jurisdictions.
## Roll-over regulations
Under the roll-over relief rules, assets and liabilities can be transferred without triggering any immediate gain or loss calculation for tax purposes. The roll-over relief rules apply for transfer of assets and liabilities between Norwegian group companies (more than 90% ownership and voting rights), partnerships (with mainly the same owners), and from a PE in Norway to a Norwegian company within the group or to another Norwegian PE within the same group. The transfer will not trigger any taxation at the time of the transfer, but all tax positions, including the tax basis of the transferred assets, will be transferred to the acquiring company. The transaction must be at arm’s-length terms. The receiving company must provide collateral for tax that may be levied on gains upon subsequent realisation of the assets. The requirement for collateral and its duration is determined by the tax office in each individual case.
In the event a transfer of assets and liabilities has been made under the roll-over relief rules and the acquiring entity ceases to be within the same group as the seller, any latent gain or loss on the assets will be recognised at the hands of the seller.
The Ministry of Finance, upon application, also has the authority to grant tax relief on the realisation of property, business, shares, etc. during a reorganisation. The reorganisation must improve the efficiency of the business to qualify for tax relief, and, accordingly, administrative effects would not be sufficient. The tax relief must also help companies to carry out the reorganisation. In addition, the tax relief must not reduce the Norwegian tax base; the tax positions would be transferred to the new taxpayer.
The Norwegian government has enacted tax exemptions for specific transactions, effective from the income year 2023. These exemptions pertain to tax-free cross-border mergers for UCITS funds and the tax-free merging and splitting of savings banks, including the establishment of savings bank foundations. Additionally, the legislation adjusts tax rules for merger and demerger schemes related to triangular mergers and demergers, setting the tax input value equal to the receivables nominal value, typically resulting in no gain or loss during conversion.
The SkatteFUNN R&D tax incentive scheme is a government program that is designed to stimulate R&D in Norwegian trade and industry. Businesses and enterprises that are subject to taxation in Norway are eligible to apply for tax relief.
All Norwegian companies and branches with R&D projects can apply for a deduction of 19% of incurred costs, limited up to a cost base of NOK 25 million annually. If the company does not have taxable income for the income year in question, the company will receive a cash refund for the year following the income year.
The main criterion for applying for SkatteFUNN is that the company has an R&D project with the aim of developing a new or improved asset, service, or production process. There are no requirements regarding type of business. A distinction is made against ordinary product development without developing new knowledge, functions, etc., the ordinary day-to-day business operations, etc.

## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement with the United States
In April 2013, Norway entered into an FATCA agreement with the United States. The agreement is based on the US FATCA regulations and is the basis for information exchange between the Norwegian and US tax authorities with regards to financial transactions.
According to the agreement, Norwegian financial institutions can report to the Norwegian authorities instead of reporting to the US authorities. It is expected that this will ease the reporting liabilities for Norwegian financial institutions.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime
Norway has also entered into agreements with other countries concerning the automatic exchange of information relating to financial accounts in order to prevent tax evasion and international tax crime. Under the agreements, the Norwegian tax authorities will receive information from foreign financial institutions and tax authorities regarding persons liable to tax to Norway.
In addition, financial institutions are liable to report certain financial information about their clients, accounts, etc. to the Norwegian Tax Administration, which will forward the information to the relevant foreign tax authorities.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
## Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
Norway signed the MLI on 7 June 2017, and on 1 November 2019 the MLI entered into force for Norway. The Convention has been ratified and the ratification documents have been deposited.
Norway included 28 treaties to be Covered Tax Agreements (CTAs) and, in addition, several other treaties are under negotiation. As of 1 January 2021, the MLI was in force for 17 countries: Australia, Cyprus, Georgia, India, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom.
These entered into force for the treaty parties as follows:
As of 1 January 2024, the MLI is also in force for Bulgaria, China, Estonia, Mexico, Romania, and South Africa.
Several other treaties are being re-negotiated. Norway signed a new protocol to the Nordic tax treaty that entered into force 28 November 2019 and a new protocol to the Swiss tax treaty that entered into force 26 October 2020.
For its agreements listed under the MLI, Norway is implementing the preamble statement (Article 6 of the MLI) and the Principal Purpose Test (PPT, Article 7 of the MLI). Norway has adopted the PPT to counter abuse of tax treaties. According to the test, a taxpayer may not assert treaty benefits if one of the primary purposes of a transaction or arrangement is to exploit benefits under the treaty.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Resident individuals can use income taxes paid to a foreign country as a credit against imputed tax (subject to limitations and tax treaty conditions). A non-resident individual would not be entitled to a foreign tax credit.
As regards the credit method, the provisions described relating to unilateral relief will be supplementary to the credit provisions of the tax treaties. A WHT may not be deducted at an amount higher than the amount determined under the provisions of a tax treaty.
According to the Norwegian Tax Act, a foreign tax credit is granted for taxes paid abroad in respect of income derived from sources abroad and capital assets situated abroad.
The credit may not exceed the Norwegian tax, calculated before deducting the tax credit that is attributable to the relevant income category that has been taxed abroad (maximum tax credit). Nor may the tax credit exceed the amount of income tax actually paid abroad for the relevant income category. Tax credits exceeding the mentioned maximum may be carried forward for up to five years.
Foreign income tax may be credited only against Norwegian income tax, and foreign wealth tax may be credited only against Norwegian wealth tax.
## Tax treaties
### Double tax treaties (DTTs)
An individual Norwegian tax resident is entitled to claim tax credits and/or tax exemptions in respect of income derived from foreign sources. In order to decide what regulations apply, the current tax treaty must be examined. In previous years, the exemption method has been favoured in the Norwegian tax treaties, but this is changing, and new treaties are now based on the credit method to avoid double taxation.
### Social security agreements
Social security agreements have been entered into with Australia, Canada, the European Economic Area, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and others.
### Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
TIEAs have been concluded with numerous countries, including countries where no other forms of tax treaties have been entered.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Proposals for special rules for private consumption in companies
On 9 May 2022, the Ministry of Finance sent out proposals for special rules for private consumption in companies. Originally, the consultation deadline for the proposal was set for 1 August 2022 and the planned entry into force in the income year 2023. In connection with the proposed national budget for 2023, the introduction of the rules has been postponed, and there will be published a new proposal in 2023, which is planned to take effect from 2024. In the 2024 state budget, the special rules were not implemented. A new proposal is expected in 2024, with potential entry into force in 2025.
## Changes regarding taxation of pension
The pension income tax free deduction and the thresholds for reducing the deduction are decided based on the pension level in the national budget issued in October, while the actual regulation of the deductions in the revised national budget issued in the spring are based on wage and price growth. Since there has been an increase in wage and price growth since October, there is a mismatch between the original estimate and actual pension growth.
The government is therefore increasing the threshold for step 1 for reducing the pension income deduction from 219,950 to 246,800 Norwegian kroner (NOK). In 2023, the deduction is phased out at a pension income level of NOK 567,650. The deduction will therefore apply to a smaller portion of pension income, resulting in a higher deduction. This is estimated to give an overall tax relief of NOK 4,500 for those who receive pension above the new threshold and up to the current threshold for step 2.
Further, this change results in a higher taxation of low pension income, since the rate for reducing the deduction is higher in step 1 than step 2 (16.7% and 6%, respectively). In order to steer the tax relief towards low pension income, the threshold for step 2 is therefore increased from NOK 331,750 to NOK 373,650.
## Changes regarding deductions for commuter travel and long-haul drivers
The government is changing the tax-free deduction for additional costs for stays in barracks, boarding houses, and dormitories without cooking facilities when commuting from NOK 177 to NOK 250 per day. The rate for long-haul drivers will change from NOK 300 to NOK 350 per day. The changes come into effect on 1 September 2023, and it is therefore not necessary for employers to retroactively correct previously submitted salary reporting.
## Additional employer share
In 2023, an additional social security contribution was implemented, entailing 5% extra employer’s contribution on income exceeding NOK 750,000. (i.e. total contributions of 19.1%). The additional employer’s contribution will be phased out, starting by increasing the income threshold to NOK 850,000 for 2024. It is 'promised' that the additional 5% will be removed by 2025.
## Possible changes in exit taxation
On 20 March 2024, the Ministry of Finance issued a proposal for consultation regarding the amendment of the rules on the taxation of capital gains, etc. upon emigration. The proposed rules entail that individuals moving from Norway will be subject to an exit tax, which is to be paid in full upon emigration, in instalments over 12 years, or in full after 12 years. The rules have an uncertain aspect in relation to European Economic Area (EEA) law and could severely impact heirs. The consultation deadline expired on 21 May 2024, and the hearing is currently marked as not yet concluded.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Personal deduction (*personfradrag*)
Individuals are entitled to a personal deduction for municipal taxation purposes. The allowance amounts to NOK 88,250. As of 2018, no special deduction is granted to spouses who are assessed jointly on their total income and capital.
## Minimum deduction (*minstefradrag*)
As an alternative to deduction for actual expenses, the taxpayer may claim a standard deduction, called the minimum deduction. The minimum deduction is intended to cover expenses normally connected with employment. The taxpayer may, however, choose to claim a deduction for actual expenses if these are higher. On the other hand, the minimum deduction may be claimed even if the taxpayer has not incurred any of the expenses the deduction is supposed to cover.
## Interest expenses
As a general rule, interest expenses are deductible irrespective of whether the debt has any connection with the earning of income or not. Interest expenses are deductible irrespective of what the loan has been contracted for and irrespective of whether the loan is secured by mortgage or not.
If the taxpayer owns immovable property situated abroad or performs or participates in a business abroad and income from such property or business is exempt from tax in Norway under a tax treaty, only a proportional part of the business expenses is deductible, corresponding to the relationship between the value of the immovable property or assets abroad and the value of the total assets. Note that this is not applicable if immovable property is located in the EEA area.
## Alimony
In general, alimony is not deductible (and not taxable for the recipient).
## Charitable contributions
Deductions may be claimed for contributions to certain non-profit organisations. The total deduction per year may not exceed NOK 25,000.
## Contingent liabilities/pension schemes
Union dues are deductible (capped at NOK 7,700).
Both employers' and employees' contributions to various pension schemes may be deductible when certain conditions exist. The rules are of a very technical and extensive character.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are normally not deductible, including interest on tax due.
## Business versus non-business expenses
Expenses related to taxable income will normally be deductible (however, the minimum deduction will comprise expenses normally connected with employment). Private expenses not related to taxable income are not deductible.
## Losses
A loss or deficit incurred in business is normally deductible from other income in the year in which it occurs.
A capital loss is deductible to the extent a gain under similar conditions would have been taxable as general income.
As a general rule, a loss or deficit may be carried forward against a later year's income for an infinite period. The loss must be deducted the first year a profit arises.
A loss may only be carried forward in case of the taxpayer's bankruptcy to the extent that outstanding debts after the bankruptcy have been paid to the creditors.
A loss may normally not be carried back. However, when a business is terminated, a loss incurred in the year of termination or the previous year, which has not been set off, may be carried back for two years or one year, as the case may be.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Employment income
All types of income from employment, whether in cash or in kind, are normally taxable. Remuneration in kind includes items such as free housing, free car, and free travel. The taxable value of a company car and most other allowances are subject to withholding tax (WHT) along with the cash salary. The taxable values of these benefits are fixed annually by the tax authorities.
If the employee receives cash remuneration to cover housing costs, the gross income will be taxable. Married assignees with family abroad may claim a tax deduction for housing costs in Norway. In these cases only, the net profit will be taxable if the payment is split between deductible costs and profit. Personnel staying in hotels, guest houses, or barracks are subject to tax only on net profit on cash housing remuneration.
### Pensions with source in Norway
A tax of 15% is levied on all pensions with source in Norway. Exemptions may apply under tax treaties and for residents within the European Economic Area (provided certain conditions are met).
## Equity compensation
A benefit derived upon the exercise or sale of an option to acquire or sell shares or primary capital certificates related to employment is subject to tax on employment income. The benefit is calculated at the time of exercise.
For call options, such benefit is calculated as the difference between the market value of the shares upon exercise and the exercise price (less a possible premium paid).
For put options, the benefit is calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the market value of the shares (less a possible premium paid).
If the option itself is sold, a benefit is calculated as the difference between the sales price of the option and the acquisition cost (premium paid). The taxable benefit of the option is spread over the years during which it has been accumulated.
Social security contributions and income tax are computed as if the benefit of the option had been derived during the period the taxpayer held the option with the same amount for each year.
## Capital gains
Whether capital gains are taxable depends on the type of asset and the period of ownership. Losses will be tax deductible, provided that gain from the sale is taxable. Net positive capital income is subject to 22% income tax.
### Gains on shares and dividends
Gains on shares and dividends are adjusted by 1.72 before being taxed at the rate of 22% income tax. The effective tax rate on gains on shares and dividends is therefore 37.84%.
### Exit tax
Exit tax rules apply to total latent/contingent gains on shares and options exceeding NOK 500,000. The calculation of the taxable benefit is based on the value of the shares/options the last day before the day the individual is regarded as non-resident according to domestic rules or the individual is regarded as tax resident in another country according to tax treaty. If the shares/options are sold/exercised later than five years after the time the employee is regarded as non-resident, the tax liability lapses.
The Norwegian government has decided to review the exit tax regime and introduce stricter rules to ensure that unrealised gains accrued in Norway are actually taxed in Norway. As a starting point, the five-year exemption is therefore no longer applicable as of 29 November 2022. The taxability will also cover the transfer of shares to close family members living abroad.
## Interest income
Income on bank deposits, bonds, securities, or other outstanding amounts is taxable. The amounts are usually taxable in the income year in which they accrue.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Tax residency
Resident status is obtained when an alien resides in Norway more than 183 days in the course of any 12-month period or 270 days in any 36-month period.
An individual who is considered resident in Norway may, at the same time, be considered resident in another country under that country's domestic legislation (dual residence). If there is a tax treaty between that country and Norway, there are normally provisions in the treaty to determine in which country a person shall be considered resident in case of dual residence or how double taxation is to be eliminated. *See the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for a list of countries with which treaties exist*.
## Discontinuance of tax residency
When a person who is considered a Norwegian tax resident is moving from Norway, the individual will be considered resident until the first year they can prove that they have not stayed in Norway for more than a total of 61 days throughout the income year (1 January thru 31 December), and the individual (or any closely related person) has not had a dwelling in Norway at their disposal.
For a person who has been a Norwegian resident for a minimum of ten years, the rule is that the individual must fulfil the above mentioned obligations for three consecutive years. Residence is broken from 1 January in the fourth year.
