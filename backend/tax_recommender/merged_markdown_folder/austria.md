## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT) (*Mehrwertsteuer*)
Generally, the Austrian VAT law is based on the 6th EU VAT Directive. Under the Austrian VAT law, companies and individuals carrying out an active business on a permanent basis are qualified as entrepreneurs for VAT purposes. As entrepreneurs, they have to charge the supply of goods or services provided to their customers with Austrian VAT at a rate of 20%. A certain limited range of goods and services is taxed at the reduced rate of 10% (e.g. books, food, restaurants, passenger transportation, medicine, hotel accommodation) or 13% (e.g. animals, seeds and plants, cultural services, museums, zoos, film screenings, wood, ex-vineyard sales of wines, domestic air travel, public pools, youth care, athletic events). Certain other transactions are exempted from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions, cross-border passenger transport by air or sea). In two areas, Jungholz and Mittelberg, a reduced VAT rate of 19% applies.
### Input VAT
Entrepreneurs are entitled to deduct Austrian input VAT insofar as the input VAT does not result from goods/services purchased that are directly linked to certain VAT-exempt sales (e.g. interest income, insurance premium). However, certain transactions are exempt from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions) without limiting the ability of the entrepreneur to deduct the related input VAT. To be entitled to deduct input VAT, the entrepreneur must obtain an invoice from one's supplier that fulfils certain formal requirements.
### VAT filing and payment
Entrepreneurs have to file monthly or quarterly VAT returns by the 15th day of the second month following the month concerned or by the 15th day of the second month following the quarter concerned. The balance of the VAT due and the input VAT deducted has to be paid to the tax office (if VAT burden) or is refunded by the tax office (if in a net input VAT position) to the electronic tax account of the entrepreneur. A separate report has to be filed by the entrepreneur at the tax office showing the cross-border, intra-EU transactions made.
## Digital services tax ('*Digitalsteuer'*)
On 22 October 2019, the Digital Tax Act ('*Digitalsteuergesetz*') was published in the Austrian Federal Law Gazette. From 1 January 2020, large multinational companies with a worldwide revenue of at least EUR 750 million and a yearly domestic revenue at least EUR 25 million from providing online advertising services in Austria are subject to 5% digital services tax.
The assessment base is the remuneration that the online advertiser receives from a customer (reduced by expenditures on intermediate inputs by other third-party online advertisers).
On 21 October 2021, Austria and other countries agreed on a Joint Statement to abolish their national digital services taxes and to refrain from introducing any new similar taxes when Pillar One comes into force. While the national digital services tax will remain in place until Pillar One comes into force, a specific crediting of the local (Austrian) digital services tax is taken into account in the transition period between 1 January 2022 and the entry into force of Pillar One.
## Customs duties
Certain cross-border inbound movements of goods from non-EU countries trigger Austrian customs duty. The duty is levied according to the Austrian customs duty scheme, which is based on the EU customs duty scheme. It defines the customs duty tariffs, dependent on the nature of the goods.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on certain products, including petroleum (approximately EUR 40 to EUR 600 per 1,000 litres), tobacco products (13% to 47% of price), and alcoholic beverages (tax rate depends on type of alcohol).
## Stability fee for banks
A stability fee for financial institutions is charged at 0.024% based on balance sheet totals of over EUR 300 million to EUR 20 billion and 0.029% on balance sheet totals over EUR 20 billion. These contributions are deemed to be used for stability measures regarding the capital market.
## Real estate tax
Local authorities annually levy real estate tax on all Austrian real estate property, whether developed or not. The tax is levied on the assessed standard ratable value (*Einheitswert*) of immovable property. The assessed value is usually substantially below the market value. The effective tax rate depends on the intended use of the real estate and is calculated using a special multiplier.
Tax rates:
- to 0.05% for the first EUR 3,650 of the assessed standard ratable value and
- to 0.1% for the next EUR 7,300.
- to 0.1% for the first EUR 3,650 of the assessed standard ratable value and
- to 0.15% for the next EUR 3,650.
- to 0.1% for the first EUR 3,650 of the assessed standard ratable value.
After the assessed standard ratable value is multiplied by the relevant multiplier, the real estate tax is calculated by using a special municipal rate fixed by each municipality (maximum 500%). Finally, the tax amount is reduced by a general reduction of 25% as stated by law and increased by a 35% inflation adjustment.
## Real estate transfer tax
Tax is generally levied at 3.5% on transactions that cause a change in the ownership of Austrian real estate or in the person empowered to dispose of such property (e.g. direct owner). Real estate transfer tax is generally calculated on the basis of the acquisition price. However, the taxable base has to be at least the property value (*Grundstückswert*). This value will be calculated either on the basis of the sum of the projected *pro rata* three-fold land value (*Bodenwert*) and the *pro rata* value of the building or derived from a proper real estate price index. Further, in case the taxpayer is able to prove that the fair market value is lower than the property value, the fair market value represents the taxable base.
In the case of real estate transfers within the closer family circle, the three-fold assessed ratable value (capped at 30% of the fair market value) is taken as the tax base, and a tax rate of 2% applies. For transfers in connection with corporate restructuring under the Reorganisation Tax Act, the two-fold assessed standard ratable value is taken as the tax base, and the standard tax rate applies.
The taxable base for free-of-charge transfers (i.e. family and non-family transfers) is the property value. The rate for transfers without compensation is subject to different levels. It is 0.5% for a property value of below EUR 250,000, 2% up to EUR 400,000, and 3.5% over EUR 400,000. In case of business transfers, the tax is capped at 0.5% of the property value. For transfers in connection with corporate restructuring under the Reorganisation Tax Act and the consolidation of shares, the tax rate amounts to 0.5% of the property value.
Real estate transactions with a tax base of EUR 1,100 or below are exempt.
Note that an additional 1.1% registration fee becomes due upon incorporation of the ownership change in the land register. The registration fee is assessed on the basis of the market value. There is a preferential taxation (three-fold ratable value capped at 30% of the fair market value) in case of family transactions or corporate restructuring qualifying for the application of the Reorganisation Tax Act.
### Share transfers
Real estate transfer tax in the amount of 0.5% is also triggered in situations where the shares of companies and shares of partnerships owning Austrian real estate are transferred. The following transactions trigger real estate transfer tax:
Shares held by a trustee for tax purposes will be attributed to the trustor and are therefore part of the calculation of the shareholding limit. Real estate transfer tax is triggered only in scenarios where the shares of real estate owning corporations or partnerships are transferred by their direct shareholder or partners (no indirect transfer). The tax base for share transfers is the property value.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is imposed in connection with certain legally predefined transactions for which a written contract has been established (e.g. lease contracts for business premises, bills of exchange, assignments of receivables). The Austrian administration's understanding of a ‘written contract’ is very broad and covers not only paper contracts but also contracts concluded by electronic means (e.g. electronically signed emails).
The stamp duty is triggered upon the establishment of a legal relationship if at least one Austrian party is contractually involved or, even if a contract is concluded between non-Austrian parties only, if the subject of the contract relates to Austria (e.g. lease contract on Austrian real estate). However, for most legal transactions, various structuring possibilities are available in order to avoid triggering stamp duties (e.g. setting up of contracts abroad, offer-acceptance procedure, usage of audio-tapes).
Pursuant to the draft of the Austrian Tax Amendment Act 2024, multiple stamp duty fees should be reduced for enclosures submitted electronically to the authority if they have already been submitted on paper for the same procedure (one-off stamp duty).
Loan and credit agreements are not subject to stamp duty.
The stamp duty rates for the most common legal transactions are as follows:
| Legal transactions | Stamp duty (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Lease agreements (1) | 1.00 |
| Certificates of bonds/pledges | 1.00 |
| Bill of exchange | 0.13 |
| Assignment of receivables | 0.80 |
Notes
1. Lease agreements concerning living space concluded as of 11 November 2017 are no longer subject to a stamp duty.
## Environmental taxes and incentives
In Austria environmental taxes comprise energy taxes, transport taxes, resource taxes, as well as pollution taxes (e.g. taxes for electricity, natural gas, and coal consumption, motor vehicle tax, vignette for the use of highways, road pricing for lorries for the use of highways, toll for specific routes on highways, tax on mineral oils, waste deposit levy, fee on water use).
Under the Eco Social Tax Reform Act, Austria introduced a carbon tax as of 1 October 2022. Pursuant to this regulation, CO2 emissions get a price (starting with EUR 30 per ton and increasing annually up to EUR 55 per ton in 2025). In order to mitigate the adverse financial effects resulting from the implementation of these provisions, the increase is partially offset by the introduction of a climate bonus. Furthermore, a carbon leakage rule aimed at preventing companies from relocating and a hardship clause for companies with high energy intensity were introduced.
Green incentives are mainly granted by Municipal Credit (*Kommunalkredit Public Consulting* *GmbH* of KPC), but also by other funding agencies (e.g. Austrian Promotion Agency or FFG). Examples are the following funding programs: Raw Materials Management, Air Pollution Control, Energy Savings, Thermal Renovation of Buildings, Indoor LED Systems, Air Conditioning and Cooling, Thermal Solar Systems, etc.
## Payroll taxes
Payroll taxes are income taxes levied on employment income that are withheld by the employer. A progressive tax rate is applied to the tax base, being the salary after deduction of allowances and various expenditures (e.g. social security contribution). The employer is legally obligated to withhold the payroll tax and liable to do so *vis-a-vis* the Austrian tax authority.
## Social security contributions
Monthly rates of compulsory (pre-tax) social security contributions are shown below for sickness, unemployment, pensions, accident insurance, and certain minor contributions:
| Social security categories | Employer (%) | Employee (%) | Total (%) |

There is also a possibility that family members can be co-insured without any additional contributions. An additional insurance contribution of 3.4% from the calculation base is collected, e.g., in cases when the co-insured person (a spouse, a registered partner, or a person running the household) does not bring up a child/children living in the common household or did it for at least four years.
In addition, the employer is liable to the Family Burdens Equalisation Levy at the rate of 3.7%, the municipal tax on payroll at the rate of 3% of monthly gross salaries and wages, and a public transportation levy of EUR 2 per week per employee in the city of Vienna. In addition, a contribution to the Chamber of Commerce is levied at a rate between 0.31% and 0.40% of monthly gross salaries paid (depending on the province). Moreover, a contribution to the mandatory employee pension fund at the rate of 1.53% on monthly gross salaries is payable for employments subject to Austrian employment law.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Generally, the Austrian VAT law is based on the 6th European Union (EU) VAT Directive. Under the Austrian VAT law, companies and individuals carrying out an active business on a permanent basis are qualified as entrepreneurs for VAT purposes. As entrepreneurs, they have to charge the supply of goods or services provided to their customers with Austrian VAT at a rate of 20%. A certain limited range of goods and services (such as food, books, passenger transportation, cultural events) is taxed at the reduced rate of 10% or 13%. Certain other transactions are exempted from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions).
#### Input VAT
Entrepreneurs are entitled to deduct Austrian input VAT insofar as the input VAT does not result from goods/services purchased that are directly linked to certain VAT exempt sales (e.g. interest income, insurance premium). However, certain transactions are exempt from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions) without limiting the ability of the entrepreneur to deduct the related input VAT. To be entitled to deduct input VAT, the entrepreneur must obtain an invoice from one's supplier that fulfils certain formal requirements.
#### VAT filing and payment
Entrepreneurs have to file monthly or quarterly VAT returns by the 15th day of the second month following the month concerned or by the 15th day of the second month following the quarter concerned. The balance of the VAT due and the input VAT deducted has to be paid to the tax office (if VAT burden) or is refunded by the tax office (if in a net input VAT position) to the electronic tax account of the entrepreneur. A separate report has to be filed by the entrepreneur at the tax office showing the cross‑border intra EU‑transactions made.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no wealth/worth tax in Austria.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Austria.
## Property taxes
### Real property acquisition tax
The following tax is levied on the acquisition of real estate, including land and buildings, or any entitlements to build on Austrian real estate. The tax rate is generally 3.5% of the consideration paid, but the minimum of the property value. However, in case of non-remunerated acquisition (e.g. donations), the tax rate is scaled as follows:
| Value of property (EUR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 250,000 | 0.5 |
| 250,001 to 400,000 | 2.0 |
| 400,001 and more | 3.5 |
## Real estate tax
Austrian municipalities impose an annual tax on real estate. The assessment base is 0.1% to 0.2% of the assessed value of the real estate. This amount will be multiplied by the assessment rate determined by each municipality, which may range up to 500%. The annual maximum amount of the real estate tax is 1% of the assessed value. Instalments will be levied quarterly on 15 February, 15 May, 15 August, and 15 November if the real estate tax exceeds EUR 75 *per annum.*
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury taxes in Austria.
Excise taxes are imposed on certain products, including certain energy products such as petroleum (approximately EUR 60 to EUR 600 per 1,000 litres), tobacco products (mixture of percentage and fixed amount per unit [kilogramme, number]), and alcoholic beverages.
Since the year 2022 a CO2-tax is payable (as per 2025 EUR 55 per ton). This tax as well increases the price for petroleum accordingly.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp duty
Stamp duty is imposed in connection with certain legally predefined transactions for which a written contract has been established (e.g. lease contracts, bills of exchange). The Austrian administration's understanding of a ‘written contract’ is very broad and covers not only paper contracts but also contracts concluded by electronic means (e.g. electronically signed emails).
The stamp duty is triggered upon the establishment of a legal relationship if at least one Austrian party is contractually involved or, even if a contract is concluded between non‑Austrian parties only, if the subject of the contract relates to Austria (e.g. lease contract on Austrian real estate). However, various possibilities are available for most legal transactions subject to stamp duty to structure them in a way without triggering stamp duties (e.g. setting up of contracts abroad, offer‑acceptance procedure, usage of audio‑tapes).

# Austria
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The standard tax assessment period in Austria is the calendar year. However, a company's financial year may deviate. When the tax and financial years deviate, the tax assessments for a year are based on the profits derived in the financial year(s) ending in the respective calendar year (e.g. if tax year is 1 June 2022 to 31 May 2023, then the assessment is financial year 2023).
## Tax returns
### General rule
Generally, the CIT return has to be submitted electronically by 30 June of the calendar year following the year in which the fiscal year of the company ends. For example, the CIT return 2023 needs to be filed by 30 June 2024.
### Representation by Austrian certified tax advisor
If the company is represented by an Austrian certified tax advisor, based on the so-called 'quota system', the tax return can be submitted electronically between 1 October of the following year and 31 March of the second following year at the latest (if the company will not be formally requested by the tax office to file it earlier). The exact month has to be agreed between the company and the tax advisor in advance (*see below*).
For example, the CIT return 2024 needs to be filed between October 2025 and 31 March 2026 (but can also be submitted before October 2025). If the end of a tax year is 31 May 2024, for example, the filing deadline is 30 June 2025 (without tax advisor) or October 2025 to 31 March 2026 (with tax advisor).
The 'quota system' was based on an agreement between the tax authorities and the Chamber of Tax Advisors and Public Accountants. With the Tax Amendment Act 2023, the previous agreement has been regulated by law and became stricter. According to the new quota system effective since 1 January 2024 and applicable for the first time for CIT returns relating to an assessment period beginning after 31 December 2022, missed deadlines may result in penalties and future quota exclusions. Therefore, the specific month during which a certain CIT return actually needs to be submitted electronically has to be agreed in advance between the company and its Austrian certified tax advisor.
Irrespective of the quota system, the competent tax office can formally request an earlier filing of the CIT return.
In case it is impossible to comply with the deadline for submitting the CIT return, an extension of the deadline can be applied for. However, the approval is a discretionary decision by the competent tax office.
### Electronic filing of annual CIT returns
## Payment of tax
CIT is prepaid in quarterly instalments during the calendar year, with a final settlement subsequent to the annual assessment (payment falls due one month after assessment). Prepayments of CIT generally are based on the most recently assessed tax year's tax burden (unless the taxpayer can show that its tax charge for the current year will be lower).
The difference between CIT as per the final assessment and the prepayments made is interest bearing from 1 October of the year subsequent to the year when the tax claim arose up to the date when the assessment is made ('late payment interest'). Interest at a rate of currently 4.53% is applied to underpayments (as well as overpayments) of tax.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits usually cover CIT, VAT, and WHT. Separate audits are carried out in connection with payroll taxes and social security contributions.
In general, companies are audited every three to four years. The audit period usually covers three to four fiscal years, so, generally, each fiscal year is audited.
## Horizontal monitoring
According to the Annual Tax Act 2018, horizontal monitoring was established as an alternative to tax audits for larger companies (i.e. turnover greater than EUR 40 million) that satisfy certain procedural requirements (e.g. comprehensive internal control system).
Under the concept of horizontal monitoring, companies are in regular contact and cooperate with the tax authorities (e.g. regular meetings take place on a quarterly basis). It is based on mutual trust and transparency between the taxpayers and the tax authorities. Companies participating in the horizontal monitoring are not subject to regular tax audits.
## Advance rulings
The Austrian tax offices can issue binding rulings in respect of a planned transaction. A binding advance ruling can be obtained on issues of business restructurings, group taxation, international tax law (DTT qualifications), VAT law, and regarding the application of anti-abuse regulations.
The fee claimed by the Austrian tax offices for the ruling varies between EUR 1,500 and EUR 20,000, depending on the turnover of the company.
## Statute of limitations
The right to assess CIT is subject to a general limitation period of five years after the end of the calendar year in which the fiscal year ends. Additionally, the limitation period can be extended in cases where certain interruptive events (e.g. tax audit, tax assessment) take place within the general limitation period. The maximum limitation period is generally ten years.
In case of tax evasion, the limitation period is also ten years.
In certain cases, the maximum limitation period can be extended to 15 years.
Regarding the limitation period for collecting CIT, generally the same rules apply.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
All individuals resident in Austria are subject to Austrian income tax on their worldwide income, including income from trade or business, profession, employment, investments, and property. Non-residents are taxed on income from certain sources in Austria only.

# Austria
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals is always the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns can be filed with the local tax office after the end of each calendar year. Separate returns are required for the period in which an individual is resident and for the period in which an individual is non-resident (but with income subject to Austrian taxation).
Joint filing of income tax returns (e.g. for spouses, family members) is not permitted, each individual has to file their own annual tax return. Tax returns have to be filed by April 30 of the following year (paper form) or end of June of the following year (electronic filing). In case the taxpayer has only salary income where wage tax has already been withheld, a tax return can be filed within five years after the end of the tax year.
In case of filing a tax return, an annual amount of EUR 10,888 is added to a non-resident's annual income.
## Payment of tax
In general, income tax is withheld from salaries/wages, interest, and dividends (*see Dividend income in the [Income determination](austria/individual/income-determination.html) section for more information*). Income tax on other types of income is payable quarterly, with an annual return filing requirement.
The final tax will be assessed by an assessment note and is payable within about one month after tax assessment.
From 1 October of the following year until the date of tax assessment, interest is payable on the final tax amount due (or will be paid by the tax office in case of tax refund). Interest can be prevented if a sufficient down payment is made by 30 September. The interest rate is the basic interest rate of the ECB plus 2%.
## Tax audit process
The tax office checks the information provided (request of additional documents or information possible) and has to issue a tax assessment note within six months after filing.
Until the statute of limitations passes (*see below*), additional checks by the tax office are possible. Tax audits usually cover the prior three years for which tax assessment notes were issued.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for excise taxes is three years, for other taxes five years. In case of tax fraud, the period is ten years.

# Austria
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Basis of corporate income tax (*Körperschaftsteuer*)
Corporations (i.e. limited liability corporation [GmbH], stock corporation [AG]) are subject to unlimited taxation in Austria of their entire (domestic and foreign) income if they have their legal seat or place of effective management in Austria. A non-Austrian corporate tax resident (with neither a legal seat nor a place of effective management in Austria) is subject to limited taxation on certain sources of income in Austria.
## Rates of corporate income tax (*Körperschaftsteuer*)
Due to the qualification of corporations as independent tax subjects, a distinction must always be made between tax ramifications at the level of the company and those at the shareholder level. At the level of the company, profits are taxed at the standard corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 23% (24% in 2023 and 25% until 2022), regardless of whether profits are retained or distributed.
At the shareholder level, the profit distributions are usually subject to WHT of 23% for corporations (24% in 2023 and 25% until 2022) and 27.5% for other recipients.
There is also a minimum CIT, payable by companies in a tax-loss position. The minimum CIT can be carried forward without time limitation and can be credited against future CIT burdens of the company.
The minimum CIT amounts to EUR 875 for an AG for each full quarter of a year.
The minimum CIT for a GmbH is EUR 437.50 for each full quarter of a year. However, for GmbHs founded after 30 June 2013, the minimum CIT amounts to EUR 125 for each full quarter of the first five years and EUR 250 for the next five years.
## Minimum tax (Pillar II)
The Minimum Tax Act transposes the complex framework of the EU’s Directive on a global minimum level of taxation into domestic law. In scope are large company groups reaching a minimum of EUR 750 million in net sales in at least two of the last four financial years, irrespective whether it is a solely domestic or a multinational company group.
In order to simplify administration, the following safe harbour rules are included in the Minimum Tax Act:
The transitional CbCR safe harbours do only apply for the first three financial years (starting 2024). The significant simplification is that for these tests the CbCR and financial information (already available within the company) is used.
The new regulations entered into force on 1 January 2024.
## Local income taxes
There is no additional state or local income tax levied at the company level.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Austria, a landlocked country of approximately nine million inhabitants in Central Europe, is bordered by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. Austria is divided into nine federal states, with Vienna as the capital. The official language of Austria is German, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Austria's economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed, agricultural sector. The Austrian economy has greatly benefited from its strong commercial relations to the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, specifically in the banking and insurance sectors.

Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Social security contributions
Monthly rates of compulsory (pre-tax) social security contributions are shown below for pensions, sickness, unemployment, accident insurance, and certain minor contributions:
| Social security categories | Employer (%) | Employee (%) | Total (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sickness | 3.78 | 3.87 | 7.65 |
| Unemployment | 3.05 | 2.95 | 6.0 |
| Pension | 12.55 | 10.25 | 22.80 |
| Accident | 1.10 | 0.00 | 1.10 |
| Miscellaneous | 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.60 |
|  |  |  |  |
| Total | 20.98\* | 18.07\* | 39.05\* |
\* On a maximum assessment basis (gross salary) of EUR 6,450 per month for current payments and is applied for both employer and employee. Special payments receive a tax favoured treatment (employer at 20.48%, employee at 17.07%, for a total of 37.55%). The maximum assessment basis (gross) amounts to EUR 12,900 per year.
There is also a possibility that family members can be co-insured without any additional contributions. An additional insurance contribution of 3.4% from the calculation base is collected, e.g., in cases when the co-insured person (a spouse, a registered partner, or a person running the household) does not bring up a child/children living in the common household or did it for at least four years.
In addition, the employer is liable to the Family Burdens Equalisation Levy at the rate of 3.7%, the municipal tax on payroll at the rate of 3% of monthly gross salaries and wages, and a public transportation levy of EUR 2 per week per employee in the city of Vienna. In addition, a contribution to the Chamber of Commerce is levied at a rate between 0.31% and 0.40% of monthly gross salaries paid (depending on the province). Moreover, a contribution to the mandatory employee pension fund at the rate of 1.53% on monthly gross salaries is payable for employments subject to Austrian employment law.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Generally, the Austrian VAT law is based on the 6th European Union (EU) VAT Directive. Under the Austrian VAT law, companies and individuals carrying out an active business on a permanent basis are qualified as entrepreneurs for VAT purposes. As entrepreneurs, they have to charge the supply of goods or services provided to their customers with Austrian VAT at a rate of 20%. A certain limited range of goods and services (such as food, books, passenger transportation, cultural events) is taxed at the reduced rate of 10% or 13%. Certain other transactions are exempted from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions).
#### Input VAT
Entrepreneurs are entitled to deduct Austrian input VAT insofar as the input VAT does not result from goods/services purchased that are directly linked to certain VAT exempt sales (e.g. interest income, insurance premium). However, certain transactions are exempt from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions) without limiting the ability of the entrepreneur to deduct the related input VAT. To be entitled to deduct input VAT, the entrepreneur must obtain an invoice from one's supplier that fulfils certain formal requirements.
#### VAT filing and payment
Entrepreneurs have to file monthly or quarterly VAT returns by the 15th day of the second month following the month concerned or by the 15th day of the second month following the quarter concerned. The balance of the VAT due and the input VAT deducted has to be paid to the tax office (if VAT burden) or is refunded by the tax office (if in a net input VAT position) to the electronic tax account of the entrepreneur. A separate report has to be filed by the entrepreneur at the tax office showing the cross‑border intra EU‑transactions made.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no wealth/worth tax in Austria.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Austria.
## Property taxes
### Real property acquisition tax
The following tax is levied on the acquisition of real estate, including land and buildings, or any entitlements to build on Austrian real estate. The tax rate is generally 3.5% of the consideration paid, but the minimum of the property value. However, in case of non-remunerated acquisition (e.g. donations), the tax rate is scaled as follows:
| Value of property (EUR) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 250,000 | 0.5 |
| 250,001 to 400,000 | 2.0 |
| 400,001 and more | 3.5 |
## Real estate tax
Austrian municipalities impose an annual tax on real estate. The assessment base is 0.1% to 0.2% of the assessed value of the real estate. This amount will be multiplied by the assessment rate determined by each municipality, which may range up to 500%. The annual maximum amount of the real estate tax is 1% of the assessed value. Instalments will be levied quarterly on 15 February, 15 May, 15 August, and 15 November if the real estate tax exceeds EUR 75 *per annum.*
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury taxes in Austria.
Excise taxes are imposed on certain products, including certain energy products such as petroleum (approximately EUR 60 to EUR 600 per 1,000 litres), tobacco products (mixture of percentage and fixed amount per unit [kilogramme, number]), and alcoholic beverages.
Since the year 2022 a CO2-tax is payable (as per 2025 EUR 55 per ton). This tax as well increases the price for petroleum accordingly.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp duty
Stamp duty is imposed in connection with certain legally predefined transactions for which a written contract has been established (e.g. lease contracts, bills of exchange). The Austrian administration's understanding of a ‘written contract’ is very broad and covers not only paper contracts but also contracts concluded by electronic means (e.g. electronically signed emails).
The stamp duty is triggered upon the establishment of a legal relationship if at least one Austrian party is contractually involved or, even if a contract is concluded between non‑Austrian parties only, if the subject of the contract relates to Austria (e.g. lease contract on Austrian real estate). However, various possibilities are available for most legal transactions subject to stamp duty to structure them in a way without triggering stamp duties (e.g. setting up of contracts abroad, offer‑acceptance procedure, usage of audio‑tapes).

# Austria
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Dividend WHT
Under Austrian domestic law, there is generally a 23% WHT for corporations (24% in 2023, 25% until 2022) and 27.5% WHT for other recipients on dividends (profit distributions) paid to a foreign parent company. The WHT has to be deducted and forwarded by the Austrian subsidiary to the tax office.
To end up with the reduced WHT rate as defined under the DTT applicable, Austrian tax law provides for the following alternative methods of WHT relief: refund method or exemption at source method.
### Refund method
The Austrian subsidiary generally has to withhold 23% WHT (for corporations) or 27.5% WHT (for other recipients) on profit distributions to the foreign parent company, and the parent company has to apply for a refund (of the difference between 23% or 27.5% WHT and the lower DTT rate). In the course of the refund process, the Austrian tax administration analyses whether the foreign shareholder can be qualified as beneficial owner of the dividends paid. If the refund is approved by the Austrian tax authority, dividend distributions within the following three years can be done without deduction of WHT (for distributions of a comparable size and provided the foreign holding structure did not change in the meantime).
### Exemption at source method
Relief at source is available only if the direct parent company, within one year after the dividend distribution, issues a written declaration confirming that it is an ‘active’ company carrying out an active business that goes beyond the level of pure asset management (holding activities, group financing, etc.) and has its own employees and office space at its disposal (substance requirements).
### WHT on dividends paid to EU companies
With regard to dividends paid to EU resident corporate shareholders, Austria has implemented the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive according to which domestic WHT is reduced to zero. The requirements for the reduction are that the EU resident parent company, which also has to meet the substance requirements mentioned above (*see Exemption at source method*) at the moment of the dividend distribution, must directly own at least 10% of the share capital of the Austrian subsidiary for a period of at least one year. In case of foreign EU shareholders being qualified as pure holding or passive asset management companies, the Austrian tax administration does not allow an exemption at source but claims the application of the refund method.
Provided the requirements according to the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive are not met, Austrian WHT has to be deducted. If an EU parent company cannot credit the Austrian WHT deducted against the CIT of its resident state (e.g. because the foreign dividend income is exempted from the CIT or due to a loss position of the shareholder), it is entitled to apply for a refund of the Austrian WHT. This application has to include a confirmation/documentation that the Austrian WHT could (fully or partly) not be credited at the level of the parent company.
## Repayment of equity
The tax-wise equity of a company has to be reported annually to the Austrian tax authority as part of the CIT return (equity account, so-called ‘*Evidenzkonto*’). This equity can be repaid to the domestic or foreign shareholders without triggering Austrian WHT. However, the tax-wise classification of a dividend as ‘capital repayment’ has to be shown in the company’s equity account and be reported in a separate tax return.
For repayments and dividend distributions, the taxpayer has the possibility to choose whether a dividend for tax purposes should be treated either as dividend distribution or as repayment of equity. The execution of the option for treating dividends as dividend distribution requires a sufficient level of retained earnings while a classification as equity payment requires a positive level of tax-wise 'disposable' equity (in addition to the formal requirements outlined above).
## Interest WHT
Interest payments to non-resident companies are currently not subject to WHT (under Austrian tax law, irrespective of any DTT being applicable).
Interest on Austrian bank deposits received by individuals resident in the European Union is not subject to WHT, as Austria agreed on the automatic exchange of information (according to directive 2014/107/EU).
Interest (accrued) on Austrian bank deposits or Austrian bonds received by non-resident individuals, where the paying/depositary agent is located in Austria, is subject to 23% WHT (27.5% WHT for Austrian bonds). A tax exemption applies if an automatic system regarding the exchange of information is available and WHT has to be withheld.
## Royalties WHT
On royalties paid to a non-resident company, Austrian WHT at a rate of 20% has to be deducted. This tax rate can be reduced under an applicable DTT or under the application of the EU Interest Royalty Directive, which was implemented in Austrian Tax Law (*please see Refund method and Exemption at source method under Dividend WHT above for further details*).
## WHT for residents
The following table lists the WHT rates for resident recipients.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties, licences |
| **Residents:** |  |  |  |
| Corporations | 0/23 (1) | 0/23 (2) | 0 |
| Individuals | 27.5 (3) | 0/25/27.5 (4) | 0 |
Notes
1. If the recipient holds a participation of less than 10% in the distributing company, the dividends are subject to 23% WHT (24% in 2023, 25% until 2022). Since dividends distributed by an Austrian corporation to another Austrian corporation are generally not subject to taxation, the WHT is credited against CIT upon assessment of the recipient corporation for the respective tax year.
2. Interest on cash deposits in euros or foreign currency in bank accounts, on fixed interest-bearing securities in foreign currency (issued after 31 December 1988), and on fixed interest-bearing securities denominated in Austrian schillings or euros (issued after 31 December 1983) are subject to 23% WHT. Companies receiving interest payments may obtain an exemption from WHT if they provide the bank or other custodial agent with a written confirmation from the recipient that such interest payments constitute a part of the recipient’s operating revenues (exemption statement).
3. WHT on dividends from Austrian companies is final, i.e. no further income tax is collected from the recipient (provided it is an individual).
4. Interest on Austrian bank deposits (or Austrian bonds), where the paying/depositary agent is located in Austria, is subject to 25% WHT (27.5% WHT on Austrian bonds). If the recipient is an individual, this WHT is final (no further income taxation and inheritance taxation).
## WHT for non-residents
The following table lists the WHT rates for non-resident recipients if no tax treaty is applicable.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties, licences |
| **Non-residents:** |  |  |  |
| **Non-treaty:** |  |  |  |
| Corporations and business enterprises | 23 | 0 (2) | 20 |
| Individuals | 27.5 | 0/25/27.5 (3) | 20 |
Notes
1. 23% WHT for corporations (24% in 2023, 25% until 2022) and 27.5% WHT for other recipients.
2. Interest payments to non-resident corporations without a PE in Austria are generally not subject to WHT (provided the loan is not secured via Austrian land property). For interest payments between affiliated companies, the regulations stipulated by the EU Interest Directive have to be taken into consideration.
3. Interest on Austrian bank deposits received by individuals resident in the European Union was subject to 35% EU WHT on the basis of the Austrian EU Withholding Tax Act. However, the EU Withholding Tax Act was abolished as of 1 January 2017 (for new bank accounts as of 1 October 2016). Subsequently, interest on Austrian bank deposits received by individuals resident in the European Union are no longer subject to WHT. The background of this law amendment is that Austria agreed on the automatic exchange of information (according to Directive 2014/107/EU).
Interest (accrued) on Austrian bank deposits or Austrian bonds received by non-resident individuals, where the paying/depositary agent is located in Austria, is subject to 25% WHT (27.5% WHT for Austrian bonds).
## Tax treaties
The table below lists the countries that have signed a DTT with Austria and provides details of the amount of Austrian WHT for the most common payments of dividends and royalties/licences. Please refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up-to-date and ensure you have considered the potential impact of the Multilateral Instrument (MLI).
Furthermore, please note that the following table reflects current values/WHT rates, and its accuracy concerning past events is limited. Please also be aware that the table below may serve as a preliminary guide by providing an initial overview. However, it is essential to refer to the respective DTT for any specific provisions or special conditions.
### Dividends
As mentioned above, the WHT rate stipulated under domestic law can be reduced if dividend distributions fall within the scope of a DTT. The applicable WHT rate varies depending on the jurisdictions involved and can be found in the respective DTT.
Under certain treaties, the amount of the WHT depends on the extent of the proportion of the issued share capital held by the recipient. Therefore, dividend distributions from substantial holdings are often taxed at a lower rate than portfolio dividends. In order to qualify as a substantial holding, a certain minimum shareholding is required. The threshold deviates depending on the respective DTT and amounts to either 10% or 25% in most cases. The applicable threshold is shown in the table below.
Dividend distributions attributable to a prior release of paid-in surplus or other shareholder contributions (classified as capital reserves) are deemed to be a repayment of capital, i.e. no WHT is incurred. At the shareholder's level, dividends received and those classified as contribution refund will reduce the tax basis assessment for investments. To the extent to which the tax basis would become negative, such dividends are treated as taxable capital gain (unless taxation is eliminated by a tax treaty).
### Royalties/licences
As mentioned above, the WHT rate stipulated under domestic law can be reduced if royalty payments fall within the scope of a DTT. Many DDTs provide for a complete exemption from WHT, while others reduce the WHT rate. In most cases, a rate of 5% or 10% is applied. While most treaties apply a uniform tax rate, some apply different tax rates depending on the specific source of the royalties.
For royalty payments between affiliated companies, the regulations stipulated by the EU Interest Directive have to be taken into consideration.
### Interest
Interest payments to non-resident corporations, under domestic tax law, are currently not subject to WHT. Therefore, they are not included in the table below.

On 10 October 2017, the Council of the European Union adopted new rules on tax dispute resolution (Directive [EU] 2017/1852). This Directive lays down rules for a mechanism to resolve disputes between member states arising from the interpretation and application of agreements on the elimination of double taxation. The Directive applies to complaints submitted after 30 June 2019 on questions relating to tax years from 2018 onwards. The EU Tax Dispute Resolution Act (‘EU-*Besteuerungsstreitbeilegungsgesetz*’ or EU-BStbG), implementing the EU directive into domestic law, entered into force on 1 September 2019.

# Austria
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Taxable income is determined based on statutory accounts under Austrian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) adjusted for certain deductions and additions prescribed by the tax law.
## Inventory valuation
In general, inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. If specific identification during stock movements is not possible, other methods, such as last in first out (LIFO) and first in first out (FIFO), are permitted when shown to be appropriate. Conformity between financial bookkeeping and tax reporting is required.
## Capital gains/exit taxation/inbound transfer
Generally, capital gains (short and long-term) are part of the normal annual result of a corporation and are taxed at the ordinary CIT rate (23% as of 2024).
A special tax treatment applies to capital gains with respect to the exit of taxable assets. In the case of a transfer of assets that formed part of a business from Austria to a foreign country (e.g. allocation of assets to a foreign branch), latent capital gains are generally taxed at the time of the transfer. The same is true if Austrian taxing rights regarding an asset are lost due to other circumstances. In case Austrian taxing rights are lost due to the transfer of assets to another EU/EEA member state, it is possible to apply for a payment by instalments (i.e. seven years for non-current assets and two years for current assets). Asset transfers for which the taxation has been postponed in the past (i.e. transfer after 1 January 2006) will be subsequently recaptured (e.g. when the assets are sold or transferred outside the European Union).
According to the Annual Tax Act 2018, the exit tax rules were amended. The current period for the payment of equal instalments for non-current assets was reduced from seven to five years for transfers as of 1 January 2019. Furthermore, according to the Tax Reform Act 2020, applicable as of 1 January 2020, it is possible to apply for a voluntary, premature payment of initially postponed taxes.
In case of an inbound transfer, generally, the fair market value of the assets is considered for Austrian income tax purposes (step up). Therefore, any hidden reserves accumulated abroad are not taxed in Austria.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from an Austrian company at the corporate shareholder level are generally excluded from the tax base (no minimum stake, no minimum holding period). This tax exemption refers to domestic dividends only, not to capital gains or losses.
Additionally, dividends received from companies located within the European Union or from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) that concluded a comprehensive agreement on mutual assistance regarding the exchange of information with Austria are also tax exempt if the foreign company is subject to a tax similar to the Austrian CIT and if the foreign CIT rate is not below 15%.
In cases where the dividends from foreign investments are taxable, foreign CIT can be credited against the Austrian CIT.
### Portfolio dividends
Portfolio dividends (i.e. dividends from an investment below 10%) received from corporations located in member states of the European Union, as well as dividends from corporations that are located in EEA and third countries having concluded a comprehensive agreement on mutual assistance regarding the exchange of information with Austria, are generally exempt from CIT. However, under special circumstances, a switch-over to the credit method, as outlined under *International participation exemption for dividends and capital gains below*, has to be considered for participations of at least 5%. Moreover, the dividend must not be deductible for tax purposes in the source state in order to be tax exempt at the level of the Austrian recipient (valid for substantial investments and portfolio dividends).
In the light of recent case law, the Tax Amendment Act 2022 stipulates that the reimbursement of capital gains tax for portfolio dividends is also possible for limited tax residents in third countries if a comprehensive administrative assistance agreement is in place with the country of residence.
### Stock dividends
A conversion from revenue reserves (retained earnings) to capital by a company does not lead to taxable income for the shareholder. However, capital reductions are treated as taxable income if within ten years prior to the capital reduction the above-mentioned increase in capital was repaid to the shareholder. Otherwise, they are tax exempt.
## International participation exemption for dividends and capital gains
Dividends received from a foreign company are also tax exempt at the corporate shareholder level if the Austrian company holds at least 10% of the issued share capital for a minimum holding period of one year (international participation exemption). Furthermore, both capital gains and capital losses derived from shares qualifying for the international participation exemption are tax neutral. This means that a deduction of capital losses is no longer available. However, the parent company (in the tax return of the year of acquisition) can exercise an (irrevocable) option for each single participation acquired to treat both capital gains and capital losses as taxable (spread of losses and depreciations over a period of seven years). The option refers to capital gains (losses) only and does not affect the tax treatment of ongoing dividend distributions.
Note: An exemption from the principle of tax neutrality of capital losses for (non-opted) international participations exist in case of the liquidation and/or insolvency of the foreign subsidiary. In such situations, final capital losses can be deducted by Austrian corporate shareholders.
### Switch-over-clause
In the case of presumed tax abuse, the participation exemption for dividends and capital gains is replaced by a tax credit (switch-over-clause). The credit system is applied if the foreign subsidiary does not meet an active-trade-or-business test (i.e. passive income from royalties, interest, etc. is greater than 50% of total income of the subsidiary) and, at the same time, is regularly subject to a foreign income tax burden of 12.5% or below. The switch-over mechanism does not apply if the dividends have already been attributed to and taxed by the Austrian controlling parent company under the CFC regime, which is applicable for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2019. *For further details, see Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](austria/corporate/group-taxation.html)**section*.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed at the general CIT rate of 23% (as of 2024).
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed at the general CIT rate of 23% (as of 2024).
## Rental income
Rental income is treated as normal business income.
## Foreign income
Austrian resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income. If a double taxation treaty (DTT) is in force, double taxation is mitigated either through an exemption or by granting a tax credit equal to the foreign WHT at the maximum (capped with the Austrian CIT incurred on the foreign-source income). If foreign WHT cannot be credited at the level of the Austrian corporation (e.g. due to a loss position), Austrian tax law does not allow a carry forward of foreign WHT to future assessment periods. However, if the source of the income is a non-treaty country, an exemption or a tax credit shall be available based on unilateral relief (representing a discretionary decision of the Austrian Ministry of Finance only, without legally entitling the applicant). Austrian tax law does not provide for a deferral of taxes on foreign income. Special rules for taxing undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries are applicable only to foreign investment funds.
Please note that a CFC rule entered into force for financial years beginning after 31 December 2018. *For further details, see Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](austria/corporate/group-taxation.html) section*.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
A corporation is resident in Austria for tax purposes if either it is registered in Austria (legal seat) or its place of effective management is located in Austria. The ‘place of effective management’ is located where the day-to-day management of the company is actually carried out and not where singular board decisions are formally made. However, the definition of place of effective management under Austrian tax law does not significantly deviate from its definition under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
An Austrian PE is defined under Austrian tax law as a fixed establishment where a business is carried out, in particular:
However, the definition of PE is different in some tax treaties. The Austrian tax authorities generally follow the commentary to the OECD model convention regarding the PE concept.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Generally, only the straight-line method is accepted for tax purposes, whereby the cost is evenly spread over the useful life of an asset. For certain assets, depreciation rates relevant for tax purposes are prescribed by tax law and shown in the following chart:
| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 2.5 |
| Buildings for residential use | 1.5 |
| Automobiles | 12.5 |
Buildings used as business assets are depreciated at a rate of 2.5%, irrespective of their use. An exception applies for buildings for residential use, which are depreciated at a rate of 1.5%.
Tax depreciation is not required to conform to financial depreciation under Austrian GAAP. If depreciated property is sold, the difference between tax value and sale proceeds is considered as a profit or loss for tax purposes in the year of sale.
Trademarks are usually amortised over 15 years. Other intangibles have to be amortised over their useful lives.
With the Economic Strengthening Act 2020 (‘*Konjunkturstärkungsgesetz*‘), the declining-balance method was introduced for fixed assets acquired or created after 30 June 2020 in the maximum amount of 30% *per annum*, based on the residual book value. The declining-balance method does not apply to intangible and used assets, buildings, goodwill, certain kinds of passenger vehicles, and estate cars/station wagons, as well as fixed assets used for promotion, transport, or storage of non-renewable energy sources and fixed assets that make direct use of non-renewable energy sources (e.g. planes). A change from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method in the course of an asset's useful life is permissible, but not vice-versa.
## Goodwill
Goodwill arising in the course of an asset deal for tax purposes must be amortised over 15 years. Goodwill that arose in the course of a share deal can be amortised only if the acquired company is included in a tax group and if the share deal was effected until 28 February 2014 (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*. Goodwill arising as a result of a corporate merger cannot be amortised.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Generally, organisational and start-up expenses are tax deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest payments (also inter-company) are generally tax deductible if they meet the general arm's-length requirements. *See Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section and Payments to foreign affiliates below for more information*.
### Financing costs
However, interest expenses relating to the debt-financed acquisition of shares from related parties or (directly or indirectly) controlling shareholders are generally non-deductible. This disallowance of interest also applies in circumstances where the shareholder acquiring the shares has been funded by a debt-financed equity contribution (insofar as the equity contribution was made in direct connection with the share acquisition). The deductibility of interest expenses incurred in connection with the debt-financed acquisition of shares from a third party is not covered by this rule.
All financing costs (e.g. fees, foreign exchange expenses, legal advice) that relate to tax-exempted international participations are non-deductible.
Interest expenses to foreign affiliates that are effectively taxed below 10% are not deductible (*see Payments to foreign affiliates below*).
### Earnings-based interest limitation
With the COVID-19 Tax Measures Act (‘*COVID-19-Steuermaßnahmengesetz*’), which was published in the Austrian Federal Law Gazette on 7 January 2021, an interest limitation rule was implemented in the Austrian Corporate Income Tax Act in order to transpose the respective provision of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). Accordingly, a company’s financing expenses are deductible only up to a maximum extent of 30% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). Net interest expenses in the amount of EUR 3 million are deductible in any case, additionally further exceptions can apply (equity escape clause, tax group clause, etc).
## Accrued expenses
Certain accruals (such as provisions for liabilities and impending losses) running for more than 12 months as of the closing date of the accounts have to be discounted, depending on their actual duration. The discount rate to be used is 3.5%. Provisions for personnel benefits (severance payments, pensions, vacations, and anniversary awards) for which specific reduction and computation methods have been provided and provisions that were already calculated by discounting a future obligation are exempt.
In general, lump-sum accruals and accruals for deferred repairs and maintenance are not allowed for tax purposes.
However, pursuant to the COVID-19 Tax Measures Act (‘*COVID-19-Steuermaßnahmengesetz*’), which was published in the Austrian Federal Gazette on 7 January 2021, lump-sum provisions are accepted for tax purposes for financial years ending after 31 December 2020.
## Bad debt
Valuation allowances for bad debts are, in principle, deductible for tax purposes, unless they are calculated on a lump-sum basis. In case of inter-company receivables, appropriate documentation regarding the compliance with the arm's-length principle is required.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to certain charitable institutions are generally tax deductible, up to a limit of 10% of the current year’s profit.
## Meals and entertainment
The deductibility of costs for business lunches generally is limited to 50% of actual expenses incurred (provided that it aims at acquiring new business).
The deductibility of entertainment expenses is restricted to advertising expenses.
## Salary payments
Payments to a member of the supervisory board (*Aufsichtsrat*) are tax deductible up to a limit of 50%.
Salaries (including all payments in cash and in kind, excluding privileged severance payments) exceeding EUR 500,000 per person and per year are not tax deductible. This rule also covers bonus payments and pension schemes. However, for pension schemes there is a EUR 500,000 *per annum* threshold to be considered separately from the other salary payments.
This rule also covers costs on-charged in relation with employees for foreign (group) companies that are an active part of the organisation of the Austrian company (e.g. foreign group staff acting as managing director of an Austrian group company).
Severance payments granted by companies to employees exceeding statutory obligations (voluntary severance payments) at the level of the employer generally represent non-deductible expenses. Only voluntary severance payments in the’old severance pay scheme‘ (called *’Abfertigung alt*‘) are deductible for CIT purposes if these are taxed with the favourable tax rate of 6% at the level of the employee. According to a decision of the Supreme Administrative Court (VwGH Ro 2020/13/0013-4), voluntary severance payments in the ’new severance pay scheme‘ (called ‘*Abfertigung neu*‘) also may partly be deducted for CIT purposes, as it would be inappropriate to completely exclude voluntary severance payments for employees in the new severance pay scheme from the deduction as business expenses. Deductible is an amount calculated in line with the rules applicable for the taxation of payments with the favourable tax rate of 6% in the old severance pay scheme.
Additionally, in line with a decision from the Supreme Administrative Court (VfGH G 228/2021-8), an exception was introduced to the ban on voluntary severance payments for payments made in the context of social plans concluded as a result of a change in business operations within the meaning of the Austrian Labour Constitution Act after 1 January 2023.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Austrian and foreign taxes on income and other personal taxes, as well as VAT insofar as it relates to non-deductible expenditures, are non-deductible. Other taxes, such as payroll taxes, are deductible.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward without any time limit. However, tax loss carryforwards can generally be offset against taxable income only up to a maximum of 75% of the taxable income for any given year. Some exceptions apply (i.e. in connection with tax groups, in case of liquidations or the recapture taxation of foreign losses), allowing a company to charge tax loss carryforwards available against 100% of annual taxable income*.*
### Loss-trafficking (Mantelkauf)
Tax loss carryforwards may be lost in case of a share deal being classified as loss-trafficking (so-called *'Mantelkauf'*) or in the course of a legal restructuring leading to similar results.
Under Austrian tax law, a share deal against compensation is classified as a *Mantelkauf* if, from a substance-over-form perspective, the 'economic identity' of a company is changed due to the transaction. The change of economic identity of a company is realised if all of the following structural changes are made to the acquired Austrian company having the tax loss carryforwards available:
All three conditions cumulatively have to be met. There is no exact time period defined within which they have to be met; however, meeting them within one year before/after the share transfer usually is regarded as a strong indication for a *Mantelkauf*.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, there are no restrictions on the deductibility of royalties, interest, and service fees paid to foreign affiliates, provided they are at arm's length (which should be appropriately documented by agreements, contracts, calculation sheets, etc.). Payments to affiliated companies exceeding the arm's-length threshold are treated as a hidden distribution of earnings (i.e. they are not tax deductible, and WHT is usually triggered at source). *See Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*.
In addition, interest and royalty payments made by an Austrian company to affiliated companies (beneficial owner) located in low-tax jurisdictions (effectively taxed below 10%) are non-deductible as well. In this context, special attention has to be paid to the fact that the low-taxation test has to be passed at the level of the beneficial owner of the income (interest income, royalties). According to the Tax Reform Act 2020, CFC rules (see *Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html)**section for more information*) prevail over the non-deductibility in order to avoid double taxation.
Note that the domestic implementation of the EU Interest Royalty Directive, which abolishes WHT on cross-border payments of interest and licence fees (regardless of whether taken out by deduction or by assessment) between affiliated companies in the member states, should be considered.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Two or more companies can form a tax group, provided the parent company directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of the shares in the subsidiaries. The tax group also can include foreign group members. However, the scope of foreign tax group members is limited to corporations being resident in EU member states and in states that have entered into a comprehensive administrative assistance arrangement with Austria. In March 2024, the Austrian Supreme Administrative Court (VwGH) confirmed the possibility of setting up a `sister` tax group in Austria (27/03/2024, Ro 2023/13/0018). Therefore, an EU/EEA corporation may become a group parent of a tax group without having to operate a registered branch in Austria. If a group member withdraws from the group within a minimum commitment-period of three years, all tax effects derived from its group membership must be reversed.
Within a tax group, all of the taxable results (profit and loss) of the domestic group members are attributed to their respective group parent. In case of foreign tax group members, tax losses in the proportion of the shareholding quota are attributed to the tax group parent. The foreign tax loss has to be calculated in accordance with Austrian tax law. However, it is capped with the amount actually suffered based on foreign tax law. Starting in 2015, ongoing tax losses from foreign group members can only be recognised to the extent of 75% of the profit of all domestic group members (including the group leader). The remaining loss surplus may be carried forward by the group parent. In addition, foreign tax losses utilised by the Austrian tax group parent are subject to recapture taxation at the time they are (or could be) utilised by the tax group member in the source state, or at the moment the group member withdraws from the Austrian tax group. Under the recapture taxation scheme, the Austrian tax group has to increase its Austrian tax base by the amount of foreign tax losses used in prior periods ('recapture profit'). There is an exception from this principle only for situations where the foreign group member ceases to exist because of liquidation or insolvency. In such scenarios, the recapture profit can be reduced by former depreciations (which were treated as non-deductible because of the status as a group member, *see below*) down to zero.
For the purpose of the application of the recapture taxation scheme, a withdrawal from the tax group is also assumed if the foreign group member significantly reduces the size of its business (compared to the size of the business at the time the losses arose). Reduction of size is measured on the basis of business parameters such as turnover, assets, balance sheet totals, and employees, while the importance of the respective criteria depends on the nature of the particular business.
Under the previous tax group regime, goodwill that arose in the course of a share deal (acquisition of an Austrian active business company from a third-party contractor) had to be amortised over 15 years, provided that the acquired company was included in a tax group. Goodwill amortisations have now been abolished and are applicable only for share deals effected until 28 February 2014. Existing goodwill amortisations are grandfathered, provided the goodwill amortisation potentially impacted the share purchase price.
Note that in 2015 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) qualified the limitation of the goodwill amortisation to Austrian target companies as not being in line with EU law (case C-66/14, Finanzamt Linz). The VwGH followed the decision of the ECJ with its decision of 10 February 2016 (case 2015/15/0001).
Consequently, the acquisition of non-Austrian EU target companies basically qualifies for goodwill amortisation. However, the decision of the VwGH only has an impact on share deals that were made before 1 March 2014.
Write-downs of participations in tax group members are not tax deductible.
## Transfer pricing
Under Austrian Tax Law, there are no explicit transfer pricing regulations available defining, in detail, the local requirements with regards to arm’s length, the documentation standards required, penalties, etc. In general, Austria applies the OECD transfer pricing guidelines referring to the OECD model tax convention. Furthermore, Austrian transfer pricing guidelines have been issued by Austrian tax authorities. The guidelines represent the Austrian authority’s understanding of inter-company business relationships with regards to their arm’s-length classification and are based on the OECD transfer pricing guidelines.
According to these guidelines, all business transactions between affiliated companies must be carried out under consideration of the arm’s-length principle. Where a legal transaction is deemed not to correspond to arm’s-length principles, the transaction price is adjusted for CIT purposes. Such an adjustment constitutes either a constructive dividend or a capital contribution. Currently, there is the option of applying for a non-binding ruling of the tax authorities. Additionally, an advanced ruling opportunity is available. Under this regulation, binding information in the fields of transfer pricing, group taxation, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can be requested from the Austrian tax authorities against payment of an administrative fee (the fee rate depends on the size of the applicant’s business).
Mandatory transfer pricing documentation is required under the Austrian *Verrechnungspreisdokumentationsgesetz* (VPDG). The VPDG follows a three-tiered documentation approach, requiring the preparation of a Master File, a Local File, and a Country-by-Country Report (CbCR), and is effective for fiscal years starting from 1 January 2016 onwards. The entire documentation is to be prepared in either German or English.
Austrian companies with a turnover above EUR 50 million in the two preceding fiscal years are subject to transfer pricing documentation requirements under the Master File/Local File concept. In case the consolidated group revenue of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group amounted to at least EUR 750 million in the preceding fiscal year, the ultimate parent entity, if resident in Austria, is obligated to file a CbCR for the reporting year 2016 with the Austrian tax authorities by 31 December 2017. According to a bilateral agreement between Austria and the United States (US) as of 16 August 2018, subsidiaries of multinational groups that file a CbCR in the United States are exempt from this reporting obligation for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2017.
Further, it is possible that any Austrian business unit (i.e. basically legal entities or PEs preparing financial statements) of a qualifying foreign MNE may take over its parent's duty to report, for fiscal years beginning from 2017 onwards, in case the ultimate parent entity is not obligated to file a CbCR in its jurisdiction of tax residence or in case no (functioning) qualifying competent authority agreement is in place with the tax jurisdiction of the ultimate parent entity that provides a basis for the exchange of the CbCR.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no explicit tax regulations available under Austrian tax law stipulating the minimum equity required by a company (‘thin capitalisation rules’). Basically, group financing has to comply with general arm's-length requirements. Therefore, an Austrian group entity being financed by an affiliated entity must be able to document that it would have been able to obtain funds from third-party creditors under the same conditions as from an affiliated financing entity. Therefore, the appropriate ratio between an Austrian company's equity and debt will mainly depend on the individual situation of the company (profit expectations, market conditions, etc.) and its industry. Nonetheless, the fiscal authorities in administrative practice (i.e. no ‘safe-harbour’ rule) tend to accept a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 3:1 to 4:1. However, the debt-to-equity ratio accepted by tax authorities also strongly depends on the average ratio relevant for the respective industry sector. If an inter-company loan is not accepted as debt for tax purposes, it is reclassified into hidden equity and related interest payments into (non-deductible) dividend distributions.
Furthermore, under Austrian commercial law, a minimum equity ratio of 8% is claimed. If the equity ratio of the company falls below 8% and its earning power (virtual period for debt redemption) at the same time does not meet certain requirements, a formal and public reorganisation process will have to be initiated.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The Annual Tax Act 2018 implementing the ATAD was published in the Austrian Federal Law Gazette on 14 August 2018 and includes the introduction of a CFC rule. The CFC rule applies to financial years beginning after 31 December 2018.
Generally, the scheme of the implemented CFC rule widely follows the wording of the ATAD. The rule covers foreign CFCs directly or indirectly owned by the Austrian corporate shareholder. Austria follows the categorical/entity approach and covers all passive income items mentioned in the directive (interest income, royalty income, dividend income, finance lease income, etc.). The CFC rule applies if the effective tax burden regarding the passive income of the foreign CFC does not exceed 12.5% (meaning that even subsidiaries in EU-countries like Cyprus, Ireland, Hungary, and Bulgaria are targeted by the rule). The scheme results in a tax-wise allocation of the low-taxed passive income item to the Austrian corporate shareholder (allowing a credit of the foreign tax levied at the level of the CFC).
With respect to the member state options included in the ATAD, Austria applied the safeguard clause (‘bona-fide clause’) also to CFCs resident or situated in third countries. Furthermore, a *de-minimis* exception in case the passive income of the foreign CFC is below one-third of its overall income is foreseen.
According to the Tax Reform Act 2020, the provisions against hybrids provided by the EU Directive 2017/952 (ATAD 2) were implemented in domestic law as of 1 January 2020. The wording of the domestic anti-hybrid rules strongly coincides with the wording of the ATAD.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit (matching credit)
R&D costs are fully deductible at the time they accrue. An R&D premium of 14% (i.e. R&D expenses x 14% = R&D premium) may be claimed for R&D activities performed in Austria.
The R&D premium is also available in case of subcontracted R&D; however, R&D incentives cannot be claimed by both principal and agent (the agent is just able to apply for the premium if the principal does not). In case of subcontracted R&D, the privileged R&D costs are capped at EUR 1 million per year.
Austria has no ‘patent box regime’.

# Austria
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Choice of business entity
The most important types of companies in Austria are the limited liability corporation (GmbH) and the joint stock corporation (AG). Foreign investors generally choose the GmbH since it provides a higher degree of corporate law control and allows for lower equity provision.
As a legal entity, the GmbH exists upon registration with the Companies' Register. The conventional application for registration must contain the notarised signatures of all managing directors. The articles of association must be drawn up in the form of a notarial deed (written document executed by a public notary) and must, as minimum requirements, include the name of the company as well as its seat, the business purpose, the amount of registered capital, and the capital contribution of each of the various owners.
The application for registration for a GmbH with only one shareholder is possible without notarised signature as of 1 January 2018 via the Internet (based on the '*Deregulierungsgesetz* 2017').
The minimum share capital for a GmbH amounts to EUR 10,000 (EUR 35,000 until 31 December 2023). Formation costs and fees are linked with the amount of the minimum share capital.
The minimum share capital for companies founded after 30 June 2013 is EUR 10,000 for the first ten years after foundation. In case a company intends to claim this foundation privilege, an amendment of the articles of association is required. After the first ten years upon incorporation, the minimum share capital will be automatically increased to EUR 35,000. Pursuant to the Company Law Amendment Act 2023 (‘*Gesellschaftsrechts-Änderungsgesetz* 2023, ‘GesRÄG2023’), a general reduction of the minimum share capital to EUR 10,000 was implemented as of 1 January 2024, and the former foundation privilege was abolished.
Generally, one half of the registered capital must be raised in cash while the remainder may be contributed in the form of assets (contributions in kind). Of the original capital contribution, at least EUR 5,000 must actually be paid in upon incorporation. Under certain conditions, the capital can be provided exclusively in the form of assets (incorporation in kind, in this case the contribution is subject to an audit verifying the market value of the assets contributed). The articles of association may provide for additional capital contributions payable by the owners on the basis of a resolution adopted by the shareholder meeting.
The minimum share capital of an AG is EUR 70,000. For an AG, the same payment regulations apply as for a GmbH, but the owners can agree upon a further capital contribution going beyond the nominal value of the shares (premium). The premium is shown on the company's balance sheet as a capital reserve.
Since 2004, the company type *Societas Europaea* (SE) can be chosen in Austria. The SE is a stock corporation based on community law. The advantages of this legal form are the simplification of organisational structures (in particular for international groups) and the possibility of cross-border transfers of corporation seats without loss of the legal identity. The SE allows the choice of a business location under an economic point of view as well as the choice of the most favourable legislation. The minimum share capital required for the incorporation of a SE is EUR 120,000 while the statutory seat of the corporation must be located in the same country where the place of management is located in.
As of 1 January 2024, a new type of company, which is characterised by flexibility and simplifications compared to the existing ones, was implemented. The introduction of the so-called flexible corporation (FlexCo; in German: Flexible Kapitalgesellschaft or FlexKap) was designed to create an internationally competitive type of company. The Company Law Amendment Act 2023 ('*Gesellschaftsrechts-Änderungsgesetz* 2023', ‘GesRÄG2023’) was published in the Federal Law Gazette on 30 December 2023. Pursuant to this Act, FlexKap is a hybrid form between a GmbH and an AG. It is particularly attractive for startups and innovative small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).
## EU state aid investigations and base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
### BEPS
Austria is involved in the BEPS-development process at an EU/OECD level. The recommendations of the OECD have been implemented in local law in individual areas (*see the limitation of the deductibility of interest under Payments to foreign affiliates in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
The main changes in local tax law due to the BEPS project are probably the introduction of local rules on the transfer pricing documentation. On 1 August 2016, the Austrian government published the new mandatory transfer pricing documentation requirements (VPDG). *For more details, see Transfer Pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*.
On 7 June 2017, Austria was one of the jurisdictions signing the MLI (Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) in Paris. The MLI entered into force on 1 July 2018. It only modifies the covered tax agreements if both contracting jurisdictions have ratified the MLI and share a common position on specific provisions. Thus, the MLI also needs to enter into effect on the DTT level in both states. For events in 2019 giving rise to local WHTs, the modification(s) of the respective treaty apply from 1 January 2019. For all other taxes (e.g. assessment in the course of a tax return), the entry into effect of the modified DTT was delayed for another year (until 2020) if the partner country's ratification took place after 30 June 2018.
The following table summarises Austria’s position, including 'Application for methods for Elimination of Double Taxation' (Article 5), 'Purpose of a Covered Tax Agreement' (Article 6), 'Prevention of Treaty Abuse' (Article 7), 'Anti-abuse Rule for Permanent Establishments Situated in Third Jurisdictions' (Article 10), 'Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishments Status through the Specific Activity Exemptions' (Article 13), and 'Arbitration' (Part VI, including article 18 to 28):

Notes
1. The agreement would not be a ‘Covered Tax Agreement’ because neither jurisdiction has included it in its notification.
2. The treaty with Russia was partially suspended unilaterally by Russia by note verbale of 8 August 2023. On 6 December 2023, Austria announced that, as of 7 December 2023, a significant part of the treaty is to be regarded as suspended, including the provisions on dividends, interest, and royalties. This also affects the application of the provisions modified by the MLI.
### EU state aid investigations
Currently, there are no investigations on the part of the European Commission with regard to Austrian tax law.
## International exchange of information
## EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC 6)
The European Union is increasing transparency to detect potentially aggressive tax arrangements. The new rules of DAC6 introduce mandatory disclosure requirements for certain cross-border tax arrangements provided the main benefit of such arrangements is the expectation of a lower tax burden and/or of other specific characteristics (so-called 'hallmarks') defined in the Directive.
The Directive has to be implemented locally by 31 December 2019 and the rules have to apply from 1 July 2020. However, the reporting obligation already applies to transactions implemented from 25 June 2018 onwards.
On 22 October 2019, the ‘EU-M*eldepflichtgesetz*’ (EU-MPfG), which implements the EU Directive locally, was published in the Austrian Federal Law Gazette. The final text of the EU-MPfG largely adopts the language of the German translation of the EU Directive. Hence, the scope of the implementation coincides with the scope of the directive (no additional hallmarks were implemented). Infringements of the Austrian reporting obligation trigger penalties of up to EUR 50,000 per case and can be imposed on several levels (company, members of board of directors). The ‘EU Meldepflichtgesetz’ became effective from 1 July 2020 onwards.
## EU Directive (DAC 7)
In March 2021, the European Union adopted Directive 2021/514, known as DAC 7, amending Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation. This Directive extends EU tax transparency rules to digital platforms and introduces new reporting obligations for platform operators to provide information on income derived by sellers through their platform.
The Tax Amendment Act 2022 (‘*Abgabenänderungsgesetz 2022*’) comprises the implementation of the Reporting Act concerning Digital Platforms ('*Digitale Plattformen-Meldepflichtgesetz*’, DPMG), which transposes this Directive into domestic law. The Reporting Act largely corresponds to the Directive and shows no significant deviations. It is applicable from 1 January 2023. The DPMG requires operators of certain digital platforms to report tax relevant information on so-called '*Anbieter*' ('suppliers') on these platforms to the Austrian tax authority. The first DAC7 report (report according to DPMG [Austrian Digital Reporting Requirement Act]) had to be submitted to the Austrian tax authority via the web portal for digital platforms until 31 January 2024. Various information and due diligence obligations had to be fulfilled prior to reporting.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
On 29 October 2014, the Republic of Austria signed a multilateral administrative agreement on the automatic exchange of information, which required Austria to apply the Standard for the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (Common Reporting Standard). EU Directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Assistance implements this Common Reporting Standard at the EU level. The EU Directive was implemented in Austrian national law (‘Austrian Common Reporting Standard Act’ or ‘*Gemeinsames Meldestandardgesetz*’) by 31 December 2015.
Based on this domestic law, financial service companies must comply with certain administrative obligations and report information on foreign account holders to the Austrian tax authorities.
## Restructuring measures (M&A from a business perspective)
Transfers of assets and undertakings can be realised with retroactive effect and be tax neutral within the framework of the Austrian Reorganisation Tax Act (so-called '*UmgrStG*').
The legislation administers the following areas (Article I-VI):
If the reorganisation qualifies for the application of the Austrian Reorganisation Tax Act, the reorganisation steps are realised tax neutrally and with a retroactive effect as of the reorganisation due date. Existing tax loss carryforwards can be transferred under certain conditions as well. Furthermore, several other tax privileges are granted under the Reorganisation Tax Act for stamp duties, etc. However, the application of the Austrian Reorganisation Tax Act requires the transaction to be classified as a non-abusive transaction; consequently, it must be based on plausible non-tax reasons.
The Austrian draft law for the implementation of the EU Mobility Directive (Directive 2019/2121; EU Mobility Directive) was published in February 2023. The draft law aims at simplifying cross-border conversions as well as mergers and divisions. The implementation primarily took place through the national EU Reorganization Act (EU-UmgrG).

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Austria has entered into DTTs with all major trading countries. Some of the treaties provide for elimination or partial elimination of double taxation by foreign tax credit (e.g. Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, United States). Under the majority of treaties, however, double taxation is avoided or partially avoided by an exemption-with-saving clause as to progression. As an exception to the rule, dividends and interest are usually fully taxable with a foreign tax credit.
## Tax treaties

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Inflation adjustment: Cold progression/bracket creep
From 1 January 2023 on, the effect of the cold progression should be counteracted as far as possible.
For this reason, each year many tax-relevant tax brackets, standard deductions, fixed payments, etc. will be valorised on an annual basis. The increase of the corresponding amounts is based on the inflation for the period June to May of the current year (arithmetic average).
2/3 of the calculated percentage will be used to increase the corresponding values as per 1 January of the next following year. The amounts that will be amended have to be announce via an ordinance by 31 August of the current year for the following year.
The tax rates will not be amended, only the applicable tax brackets.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Employee portions of mandatory contributions to Austrian and/or foreign social security are tax deductible.
In computing income from employment, expenses related to the production and collection of income is generally tax deductible. These expenses include the following:
## Personal deductions
### Special expenses
Church tax is deductible up to EUR 600, and charitable contributions to certain institutions are deductible up to 10% of the current year’s taxable income. Austrian tax adviser fees are fully deductible.
### Extraordinary expenses
Individuals who incur extraordinary expenses can obtain some tax relief. This relief applies to resident individuals who are subject to unlimited tax liability who incur unavoidable expenses (e.g. funeral costs, medical expenses for special treatments not reimbursed by health insurance). Depending on income and family status, the taxpayer may be able to deduct an amount that exceeds a certain percentage of one's income. The retention rates are as follows:
| Annual income (EUR) | | Retention rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 7,300 | 6 |
| 7,300 | 14,600 | 8 |
| 14,600 | 36,400 | 10 |
| 36,400 |  | 12 |
The percentage is reduced by 1% for an individual:
Certain expenses (e.g. damage due to disaster) are generally fully tax deductible.
### Family bonus plus
The family bonus plus is a tax credit, which reduces the amount of tax paid. The annual tax credit of EUR 2,000 per child can be claimed for children up to the age of 18 years, who live in Austria, and are entitled to family allowance. If both parents claim the family bonus plus, both taxpayers are entitled to 50% of the tax-free amount (EUR 1,000 *per annum* for each taxpayer).
For children between 19 and 24 (in some cases until 25), the family bonus plus can be granted up to an amount of EUR 700 *per annum*.
## Allowances
Generally, personal allowances take the form of tax credits, i.e. deductions from tax payable. By contrast, family allowances are paid to the taxpayer in cash. *See the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*.
## Losses
Business losses or rental losses can be offset with other categories of income. Business losses can be forwarded in following years in case assessed by adequate and orderly accounting.
Rental losses cannot be carried forward.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Special ruling for expatriates
The consideration of flat-rate professional expenses is possible in the ongoing payroll accounting or in the annual income tax return.
You will find the provision in detail below:
### How is an expatriate defined?
An expatriate is an employee:
All these persons are entitled to a flat-rate professional expenses allowance of 20% of the calculation basis.
### How is the calculation basis determined?
The calculation basis results from the gross remuneration:
If the employee does not work in Austria for the whole year, the (maximum) amount is to be calculated on a *pro rata* basis. Months commenced are treated as full months.
### The professional expenses exceed the flat rate - what needs to be done?
Please note that cost reimbursements pursuant to Section 26 of the Income Tax Act (*Einkommensteuergesetz*or EStG) (e.g. remuneration for relocation) reduce the flat rate for professional expenses. However, travel reimbursements pursuant to Section 26 Clause 4 of the Income Tax Act (EStG) do not reduce the flat-rate allowance.
### Time aspect?
In contrast to the flat-rate allowances for professional expenses for other professional groups, the flat rate for expatriates can already be taken into account by the employer directly in the monthly payroll accounting; if this is not the case, the allowance can be claimed in the employee's tax declaration.
If the flat-rate allowance for professional expenses is taken into consideration in the monthly payroll accounting, this is to be listed in wage slip L16 under "allowance pursuant to Section 63 of the Income Tax Act (EStG)". A separate notice of the allowance is not necessary.
Additional special expenditures, business expenses, and extraordinary financial burdens can be considered in the annual tax return.
In case of consideration during payroll, the employer must forward a written notification to the appropriate tax office at the beginning of the assignment and thereafter at the beginning of every calendar year, stating the names of the employees for whom the beneficial tax treatment is claimed, and must inform the tax authorities of their personal data, including addresses in Austria and in the foreign country.
## Work and residence permit
According to the current Austrian legal regulations, individuals who wish to take up employment in Austria basically need a work permit and residence permit unless they are citizens of a country that is a member of the European Union, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland. Special provisions apply for British citizens as of 1 January 2021 (*please see below*).
Nevertheless, EU/EEA and Swiss nationals must apply for a registration certificate (*EU-Anmeldebescheinigung*) at the competent immigration authority within four months of arrival if they intend to stay longer than three months in Austria. The registration certificate is only qualified as a kind of registration requirement and not as a permit as such.
Furthermore, depending on the individual's professional experience and educational background, other immigration routes may be applicable, such as the Red-White-Red Card or the Blue Card-EU, which are combined work and residence permits for local hires only.
Note that only upon receipt of a combined work and residence permit may a third-country national legally start working in Austria.
Family members (spouses over 21 years, children younger than 18 years) of ICT permit holders can apply for a residence permit ‘Family Member (with ICT)’, family members of Red-White-Red Card or Blue Card-EU holders can apply for the Red-White-Red Card plus.
Also introduced by the legislator as of 1 October 2017, for third-country nationals who hold a valid work and residence permit from an EEA country, a so-called ‘Personal Lease Confirmation – EU’ (EU-*Überlassungsbestätigung*) can be issued (by the local labour authority) for temporary employment in Austria.
As far as regulations for British nationals post Brexit are concerned, the following regulations apply from the perspective of Austrian immigration law as of 1 January 2021:
British nationals who have exercised their right of residence in Austria before the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 or who have exercised employment as cross-border commuters in accordance with EU law and who continue to reside there or work as cross-border commuters thereafter will continue to have unrestricted access to the Austrian labour market on the basis of the withdrawal agreement.
British nationals who wish to take up long-term employment in Austria from 1 January 2021 will not be granted such special status under the Withdrawal Agreement. Since the Trade and Cooperation Agreement of 24 December 2020 does not provide for any special regulations either, the same regulations that apply to other newly arriving third-country nationals therefore apply to these individuals. British nationals who plan to work or settle in Austria for more than six months must therefore apply for a residence permit under the Settlement and Residence Act (such as a Red-White-Red Card for highly qualified key workers).
However, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement contains provisions on short-term business trips, intra-corporate transferees, contract service providers, and freelancers. An individual assessment of each case is required.
Furthermore, the agreement contains a clause on short-stay visas (stay of 90 days within a period of 180 days). In this clause, the European Union and the United Kingdom have agreed that short stays in the European Union or the United Kingdom will continue to be exempt from visa requirements.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment income
Income from employment includes all benefits in cash or in kind received by an individual from an employer and from third parties. Benefits in kind are valued according to specific rules, with some cases of global allocations (mainly cars). Company-provided housing might be valued at 75% of the actual gross rent paid by the company; reimbursement for privately paid housing is fully taxable. Certain minor benefits in kind (e.g. the granting of company stock up to an annual limit of EUR 3,000 per employee) or employee profit sharing (up to an annual limit of EUR 3,000 per employee) are tax exempt (when the legally given conditions will be fulfilled).
Reimbursement of an employee's actual relocation costs (due to a transfer or group internal transfer, not when a new job with a new employer will be started; the employee must give up one's residence) is tax-exempt; lump sum relocation allowances are tax-exempt within certain limits (due to a transfer or group internal transfer, not when a new job with a new employer will be started; the employee must give up one's residence). Reimbursement of tax costs is fully taxable.
Bonus payments (e.g. 13th- and 14th-month salaries, i.e. vacation and Christmas pay) up to an annual amount equal to two average monthly salaries are taxed as follows:
| Other remuneration (EUR) | Wage tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| for the first 620 | 0 |
| for the next 24,380 | 6 |
| for the next 25,000 | 27 |
| for the next 33,333 | 35.75 |
| above 83,333 | regular tax rate, typically 50% |
## Equity compensation
Special rules apply to employee share schemes granted to all employees or to certain groups of employees. The acquisition of shares of an employee (from the employer or a group company) either at a favourable purchase price or free of charge is considered tax-free up to an amount of EUR 3,000 per calendar year (for all equity plans together). Amounts exceeding EUR 3,000 are taxed at the progressive tax rate. Generally, the shares have to be deposited with a European Community (EC) bank, an Austrian branch of a foreign bank, or a trustee (may be located abroad). A transfer of shares within five years after acquisition is taxable if the employment contract is still in force (the originally tax free amount has to be taxed). The employee has to prove by 31 March of each year that the shares have not been sold. Otherwise, the originally tax free amount is taxable.
## Employee profit sharing
Special rules apply to employee profit sharing schemes granted to all employees or to certain groups of employees. The payment of a bonus is considered tax-free up to an amount of EUR 3,000 per calendar year. Amounts exceeding EUR 3,000 are taxed at the progressive tax rate. The bonus is linked with and limited by the profit of the company.
## Business income
Taxable profit is the total income realised from carrying on business activities, whatever the nature of the income or business.
As a general rule, the taxable profit of a small business (up to a turnover of EUR 700,000) and special freelance professionals (e.g. lawyers, tax advisors, artists, doctors) is determined on a cash basis. For a larger business, the profit is calculated on an accrual basis of accounting.
## **Capital income**
Capital income encompasses, *inter alia*, interest income, dividends, and capital gains, as well as income from investment funds.
### Interest income
Interest income from (publicly placed) interest-bearing securities is subject to tax at 27.5%, whereas interest income from bank deposits/savings is taxed at a rate of 25% (interest from privately placed securities and private loans is taxed at the progressive income tax rate). With this WHT deduction by the Austrian bank, the income tax in general is deemed to be satisfied (final or definitive taxation).
Losses (negative capital income) cannot be offset against positive interest from bank accounts/deposits but can be offset against coupon interest from debt securities acquired after 30 March 2012.
Interest income from securities in foreign deposit accounts that is not subject to the WHT deduction must be included in the income tax return and is taxed at a 27.5% special tax rate.
If the individual’s average tax rate is less than 27.5%, then, upon assessment application, a reduction to the lower average tax rate is possible where all definitively taxable income, as well as income subject to the special tax rate, must be included.
### Dividend income
Domestic earnings from dividends are definitively taxed for income tax purposes with the 27.5% WHT deduction by the corporation distributing the dividend.
Foreign dividend earnings paid to a domestic deposit account are also subject to final taxation through the 27.5% WHT deduction. In this case, however, banks are only liable for WHT insofar as they know the nature of the capital income.
Dividend income paid to foreign deposit accounts must be included in the tax return. Such income is subject to the special 27.5% tax rate.
If the investor applies for assessment of the capital income, dividend income is subject to the average tax rate. Regardless of a double taxation treaty (DTT) with the corresponding source country, foreign paid taxes on foreign dividends can be credited up to maximum of 15% (by the Austrian depositary bank).
Where disposal profits or income from capital assets are derived from abroad, then the corresponding double taxation convention must be taken into account.
### Capital gains
Under the Austrian capital gains regulations effective since 1 April 2012, capital gains resulting from sales of shares (including qualifying participation's), securities, or other financial assets (e.g. securitised derivatives, certificates) are subject to 27.5% income tax as a final tax if the assets have been acquired after 31 December 2010 (or 30 March 2012 for interest-bearing securities and securitised derivatives). Realised capital gains from the sale of securities or other financial assets bought before the above mentioned date ('grandfathered' assets) are generally tax free. The grandfathering provisions do not apply to holdings where the relevant person owned at least 1% of the total issued capital of a company at any time within the five-year period preceding 1 April 2012.
The capital gain taxation provides for calculation of the realised capital gains by deducting the acquisition costs from the disposal proceeds (each inclusive of accrued interest, where applicable, but excluding transaction charges and other costs for individuals). Acquisition costs for securities with the same security identification number are derived from a moving average of the actual costs of acquisitions.
Realised capital losses on assets may be offset against capital income and gains earned within the same calendar year. The following exceptions apply:
### Investment funds
The basic principle of taxation of both Austrian and foreign investment funds is transparency (if foreign investment funds comply with the Austrian reporting requirements, the same taxation rules are applicable as for domestic funds).
Taxable income from investment funds consists of both ordinary income (e.g. dividends and interest income) and income from capital gains realised at the fund level. Both types of income may be distributed or accumulated within the investment fund. Distributions of ordinary income and income from capital gains are taxable with 27.5% with no difference between domestic and foreign funds. The key difference in treatment depends on whether the foreign investment fund is registered as a reporting fund or not registered and therefore a non-reporting fund.
Capital gains realised by the fund are taxable; however, for private investors, only 60% of accumulated realised capital gains are taxable (applicable for Austrian funds and in Austria registered foreign reporting funds, but not for non-registered foreign non-reporting funds).
The accumulated income of a fund is deemed to be distributed to the fund holders and taxed accordingly. The Austrian tax figures have to be filed by an Austrian tax representative within five months after the fund’s financial year-end for domestic investment funds and within seven months after the fund’s financial year-end for foreign investment funds.
Income (distributed or accumulated) from domestic Austrian investment funds and foreign investment funds held by a private investor on a domestic deposit account is basically subject to immediate and complete final taxation with 27.5% Consequently, domestic and foreign reporting investment funds held by a private investor on a domestic deposit account do not have to be included into the annual tax return.
Non-reporting foreign investment funds will be taxed differently. The tax rates are the same, but the calculation of the taxable amounts is different. As for these investment funds, the composition of the income (interest, dividends, capital gains) is not known. The calculation of the taxable deemed distributed income (DDI) is based on a lump sum calculation rule: taxable as DDI are 90% of the growth in value during the year, but at least 10% from the value of the fund at the end of the year. The DDI calculated will be taxed at 27.5%. The taxed DDI increases the acquisition costs of the investment fund. The actual distribution and the capital gains when the shares of the fund are sold are usually available. For this reason, the actual amounts can be calculated and are taxable at the 27.5% rate.
Income from investment funds held by a private investor on a foreign deposit must be included in the investor’s annual income tax return and is taxed at a 27.5% special tax rate.
## Rental income
Rental income is subject to the individual progressive tax rates.
Rental income is the difference between the rent payments received less any deductions for expenses paid (e.g. mortgage, repairs).
In case of foreign rental income, the conditions of the applicable DTT have to be considered, and foreign rental income has to be converted into Austrian rental income, based on the Austrian tax rules.
## Exempt income
Only income mentioned in the income tax act is taxable. For this reason, heritages, gifts, earnings from gambling or bets, specific awards, finder’s fees, etc. are income tax free.

The retiree allowance is reduced on a pro-rata basis for annual income between EUR 21,245 and EUR 30,957. For income exceeding the limit of EUR 30,957 *per annum*, no credit is available.
## Family allowance
A monthly tax-free cash payment for children up to age 18, or up to 24 if still in school, or handicapped (up to age 25 under certain conditions), is granted by the government upon formal request. Family allowance (*Familienbeihilfe*) in Austria is only granted if no foreign entitlement to child benefit is given.
For children living in Austria, the allowances are as follows:
Monthly increase: The total family allowance is increased for each child by:
A 13th instalment of family allowance of EUR 121.40 per child will be paid by the tax office in the month of September in each calendar year for each child between the ages of 6 and 15.
These allowances are granted even in cases where no income tax is payable.
Family allowance is paid by the tax office in cash along with the monthly child allowance of EUR 70.90 for each child.
Furthermore, a child care allowance (*Kinderbetreuungsgeld*) is granted for new-born children. An amount between EUR 17.65 and EUR 80.12 per day is paid for children who have passed the mother-child check up and depends on the length of maternity leave taken by the individual. If the mother-child check up examination is not taken, the child pay will be reduced.
One can choose between flat-rate and income-related child care allowances, whereas the income limit with a flat-rate option is EUR 18,000 per year, the income limit is EUR 8,100 per year if one chooses the income-related option.
An additional allowance for three or more children is granted (*Mehrkindzuschlag*), but only when the family allowance for children has been obtained and the household income for the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 55,000. The additional allowance amounts to EUR 24.40 per month for the third and each additional dependent child. This allowance has to be applied by filing a tax return.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
A person is generally regarded as resident with the establishment of an abode or, in any event, after a six-month stay in Austria.
Nationality is not in itself a criterion for determining residence or tax liability; however, it may serve as an indicator of residence in cases of doubt.
