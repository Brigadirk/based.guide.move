## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Passive income (dividends, interest, royalties) from Ukrainian sources that is paid to non-resident entities is generally subject to 15% WHT. Other payments, including payments for engineering services, lease payments, and agency and brokerage fees, are also subject to 15% WHT, but payments for most other services are not subject to withholding. WHT rates may be reduced under a relevant tax treaty.
The 15% WHT rate applies to income (rather than capital gain) on the sale of real estate (including construction in progress) and on profits from the sale of securities.
Capital gains from alienation of shares in Ukrainian companies are subject to 15% WHT unless such shares are traded on a qualifying stock exchange or the respective DTT provides for exemption. Capital gains from either a direct or indirect alienation of shares of Ukrainian companies rich in real estate are also subject to 15% WHT. A non-resident that acquires shares should register itself with the Ukrainian tax authorities as a CIT payer in Ukraine and report and pay tax liabilities (if any).
Capital gains from disposal of interest-free (discounted) bonds and treasury bills are taxed at an 18% rate.
Income in the form of interest, discount, and capital gain from disposal of Ukrainian government / municipal bonds or bonds guaranteed by the state or municipal bodies is not subject to WHT (except capital gains received by a resident of a low-tax jurisdiction).
Payments for freight services (including sea freight) are subject to 6% WHT.
А special 5% WHT rate on qualifying Eurobond yield applies (excluding payment of interest to residents of low-tax jurisdictions).
Starting from 1 January 2021, certain types of payments will be treated as deemed dividends subject to 15% WHT. Such payments include (i) payments for goods/services/shares purchased in controlled transactions in excess of the arm’s-length level, (ii) the amount of understatement of the selling price of goods/services in controlled transactions below the arm's-length level, and (iii) payments related to reduction of share capital, share buy-back, exit from shareholding, or similar transactions that result in decrease of a Ukrainian company’s retained earnings.
As a general rule, the WHT due should be withheld and remitted to the tax authorities by the Ukrainian taxpayer that makes the respective payment to a non-resident and no later than the date of such payment. In certain cases (e.g. deemed dividend distribution), the option of later WHT payment is envisaged based on a gross-up mechanism.
Starting from 1 July 2024, the retention period of primary documents for WHT purposes has been extended from 1,095 days to 2,555 days, and tax authorities have the right to conduct a tax audit regarding WHT issues for this period.
## Application of treaty benefits
The non-resident recipient of income sourced in Ukraine must also be considered the beneficial owner of such income in order to benefit from the reduced tax rates under relevant tax treaties. The beneficial owner test applies only if it is also stipulated by the respective DTT. According to the Tax Code, agents, nominee holders, and other intermediaries in respect of received income cannot be beneficial owners of income sourced in Ukraine, and, therefore, are not entitled to favourable treaty provisions. Lack of substance at the level of income recipient (e.g. lack of sufficient decision-making powers, assets, qualified employees, equity, significant functions, and risks with respect to the received income) may indicate that such recipient of Ukrainian-sourced income is a mere intermediary and consequently not the beneficial owner of such income.
Interest payable under a syndicated loan through the organising bank may be subject to reduced WHT rates under the DTTs between Ukraine and the country of residence of each participating bank.
The Tax Code provides for a look-through approach for all taxpayers (i.e. if the direct recipient of Ukrainian-sourced income is not the beneficial owner, the reduced rate under the DTT with the jurisdiction of the beneficial owner may be applied).
A principal purpose test (PPT) is incorporated into the Tax Code. Under this test, the DTT benefits may be denied if one of the principal purposes of a cross-border transaction was an intention to obtain such treaty benefits (this is basically alignment with the MLI).
## Remittance tax
A resident payer is required to pay, from its own funds, a 12% remittance tax if a payment is made to a foreign insurer or reinsurer whose rating of financial reliability does not meet the requirements set by the authorised state agency. Otherwise, 0% or 4% rates apply depending on the type of reinsured risk.
The remittance tax is levied on a resident party and cannot be relieved using a tax treaty.
## MLI status
The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) came into force for Ukraine on 1 December 2019. Ukraine decided that the MLI should cover all its DTTs (except for the treaty with Qatar), but not all other countries choose to apply the MLI to their treaties with Ukraine. Therefore, not all treaties with Ukraine are modified by the MLI.
Ukraine chose the following MLI novelties/amendments to apply to its treaties:
It is noteworthy that the new rules apply to a certain treaty only if the other signatory thereto also chooses to apply the same rules.

Notes
1. The ownership threshold for the non-portfolio rate is 10%, 20%, 25%, or 50%, depending on the specific provisions in the treaty.
2. Several treaties contain a rate of 0% on interest paid to or guaranteed by a government or one of its agencies.
3. If more than one rate is shown, this means that the rate will depend on the type of royalties paid.
4. The 18% rate applies to dividends from privileged shares or other fixed payments on shares, as well as to disguised employment income. Dividends received from a Ukrainian legal entity CIT payer (other than collective investment arrangement) are subject to the 5% rate. Dividends received from collective investment funds are subject to the 9% rate.
5. The lower rate applies to interest paid on certain credit sales and on loans granted by a financial institution.
6. The treaties with Japan, Malaysia, and Spain were entered into by the USSR before it dissolved. Ukraine will continue to honour these treaties, unless they are superseded. A new treaty with Malaysia has already been signed and awaits ratification from the Malaysian side. Ukraine has already ratified the new treaty. Spain and Ukraine signed a tax treaty on 10 September 2020 pending the ratification procedures by both countries. On 19 February 2024, Ukraine and Japan signed a new tax treaty, and, in June 2024 Ukraine ratified this treaty. Under the new DTT, reduced WHT rates of 5% for dividends and royalty and 5% and 10% for interest will be introduced.
7. The lower rate applies to interest paid in connection with the sale on credit of any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, unless the debenture is between associated enterprises.
8. The 0% rate applies if the investor holds at least 50% of the capital of the company paying the dividends and the capital invested is at least USD 1 million; the payer of dividends should not operate in the field of gambling, show business or an intermediation business, or in auctions.
9. The 0% rate will apply if a French company or companies hold, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the capital of the Ukrainian company, and the aggregate investments exceed 5 million French francs.
10. The lower rate applies to interest paid on any loan granted by a bank.
11. The 0% rate applies if the recipient of income is a pension fund or its investment or the capital of the company paying the dividends is guaranteed or insured by a government or one of its agencies.
12. The 10% rate applies if the company receiving the dividend has, for an uninterrupted period of two years before the dividend is paid, owned at least 25% of the capital stock of the company paying the dividends.
13. The 5% rate applies if the capital invested is at least USD 50,000.
14. The 0% rate applies if the Swedish company directly holds at least 25% of the voting power of the company paying the dividends and at least 50% of the Swedish company is held by Swedish residents.
15. The 5% rate on dividends applies if the Cypriot company holds at least 20% of the capital of the Ukrainian company paying the dividends and the capital invested is at least EUR 100,000.
16. The lower rate applies in the case of interest paid in connection with the sale on credit of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or on any loan granted by a bank.
17. The 5% rate applies if the royalties are payments for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of scientific work, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience. The 10% rate applies for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary or artistic work, including cinematograph films, and films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting.
18. Ukraine signed a treaty with former Yugoslavia before it dissolved. Ukraine applies this treaty in its relations with current Montenegro and Serbia, unless the treaty is superseded.
19. The DTT between Ukraine and Iran will be terminated on 1 January 2025.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
The Tax Code determines taxable profits as net profits before tax (NPBT) as per accounting records, either Ukrainian statutory or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and adjusted for ‘tax differences’.
Taxpayers with prior year annual income equal to or less than UAH 40 million (net of indirect taxes) may opt out of making the adjustments. Note that they do remain eligible for loss carryforward allowances (*see the [Deductions](ukraine/corporate/deductions.html) section*).
## Inventory valuation
A taxpayer is entitled to adopt any of the methods of inventory valuation prescribed by financial accounting rules, namely: the first in first out (FIFO) method, weighted average methods, identified cost of unit of goods, normative cost, or sale price. The last in first out (LIFO) method does not apply in Ukraine.
## Capital gains on the sale of property
Income from the sale of property (including buildings and land plots) should be recognised according to financial accounting rules.
## Income from securities
Profit from trading in securities is taxable at the standard CIT rate. Incurred losses are non-deductible, but may be carried forward to offset future profits from trading in securities without any limitations.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Ukrainian entity from another Ukrainian entity that is a CIT payer are exempt from CIT.
Dividends received by a Ukrainian entity from a non-resident are exempt from CIT only if:
Companies paying dividends are required to pay advance CIT on payment of dividends (ATD) at the standard CIT rate, unless the dividends are paid to individuals or out of received dividends from its subsidiaries, i.e. pass-through dividends (with some other exceptions). ATD applies only to the portion of dividends that exceeds taxable profits (i.e. adjusted NPBT) of the respective dividend year for which CIT is already paid.
If the amount of the paid ATD exceeds the amount of the accrued CIT of the taxpayer-issuer of corporate rights, the excess amount will be applied to reduce the taxpayer’s CIT payment due in the following periods. In case the taxpayer is in a loss-making position, the said amount will be carried forward to the following periods until it is fully utilised. Collective investment vehicles and taxpayers under the simplified tax regime are released from ATD.
## Interest income
Interest received by taxpayers is included in their taxable income on a general basis according to financial accounting rules.
## Rent/royalties income
Income from rent/royalties received by taxpayers is included in their taxable income on a general basis according to financial accounting rules.
## Foreign exchange gains/losses
Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses are generally treated as taxable income/deductible expenses, similar to financial accounting rules.
## Other significant items
Ukrainian tax legislation does not provide special tax treatment for bribes, kickbacks, or illegal payments.
Income received as payment for goods (works, services) shipped (provided) while the taxpayer used the simplified tax system will increase the NPBT.
The CIT base shall be increased by 30% of the value of goods, works, or services purchased/sold from/to residents of low-tax jurisdictions and non-resident entities established under certain legal forms. The lists of low-tax jurisdictions and legal forms (e.g. a partnership) are approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and are being amended from time to time. This rule does not apply if the transaction is controlled for transfer pricing purposes. Even if the transaction is uncontrolled, this rule can be waived if a taxpayer confirms the arm’s-length nature of the transactions in accordance with the transfer pricing rules.
Profits from sale of an indivisible residential construction in progress/future object of residential real estate is recognised in the period of putting the respective object into exploitation.
## Foreign income
Foreign income is taxed under the general rules, and there are no special rules regarding anti-deferral or unremitted earnings.

# Ukraine
## Overview
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Ukraine, located in the heart of Eastern Europe and occupying a land area of 603,700 square kilometres, is the second largest country in Europe after Russia. It is divided into 24 provinces (oblasts) and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, with Kyiv as its capital and the largest city. Ukrainian is the official language, and the currency is the hryvnia (UAH). Ukraine's population was estimated at approximately 36.7 million people as of 2024.
Ukraine's proximity to the European Union (EU), the sheer quantity of its consumers, and the physical size of the country makes it an opportunity for investments. The country's main asset is its extensive human capital. Ukraine's well-educated workforce provides a competitive advantage.
After rebounding from the 2008/09 financial crisis, with positive gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2010 to 2013, Ukraine again suffered from a significant decline in GDP in 2014 and 2015. During 2014 to 2016, Ukraine faced a number of significant political, economic, and social problems, which resulted in a contraction of industrial production, a significant devaluation of the national currency, and an outflow of investments.
As a result of the ongoing confrontation with the Russian Federation, which escalated from 24 February 2022, the territories of Crimea and some territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions are currently treated as ‘temporarily occupied’ with a specific legal regime. New territories that are *de facto* occupied by the Russian Federation as a result of escalation of the Russian Federation military invasion may be declared as Temporarily Occupied Territories subject to the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine enacted by the Decree of the President of Ukraine. Active military actions between Ukraine and Russian armies take place in the East and South of Ukraine. The war had significant negative impact on the economy of Ukraine, with a 30% reduction of GDP in 2022. However, in 2024, Ukrainian GDP has grown by 3.2% according to various reputable analysts and organisations (e.g. World Bank).
Ukraine signed the Association Agreement with the European Union, and it has come into force starting 1 September 2017. Moreover, Ukraine was granted the status of EU member candidate on 22 June 2022. Reforms and significant changes in local legislation are needed in order for Ukraine to meet the business standards and principles familiar to the EU investors.
The Ukrainian Tax Code, which took effect in 2011, has already been tested by businesses. It was also amended by legislators a number of times between 2012 and 2024.
The Customs Code of Ukraine, which took effect in 2012, introduced the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Kyoto Convention, and World Customs Organisation (WCO) requirements. Currently, the government of Ukraine is working on implementing EU standards in customs legislation (AEO programme, accession to the Convention on Common Transit, protection of intellectual property rights at the moment of importation).
In late December 2023, the Ukrainian government published the National Revenue Strategy 2030. The respective documents outline a proposed plan to develop and introduce changes to many tax related rules, including alignment of VAT and excise rules and rates to the ones in the European Union, significant changes in the simplified tax regimes, changes in taxation of the resource extraction industries, progressive tax systems for individuals and some businesses (super profits tax), more strategic approach to tax benefits, as well as taxation of virtual assets and profits of digital companies.
## Martial law enacted in Ukraine from 24 February 2022
Ukraine became subject to a military aggression of the Russian Federation, which led to the imposition of martial law from 05:30 on 24 February 2022 according to the Decree of the President of Ukraine dated 24 February 2022 № 64/2022 'On the Imposition of Martial Law in Ukraine'. The martial law was further extended till 14 February 2024 by a number of Decrees of the President of Ukraine approved by the Parliament of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (the 'CCI of Ukraine'), in its Letter dated 28 February 2022 № 2024/02.0-7.1, has recognised the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine as *force majeure* circumstances. The *force majeure* circumstances in question lasting from 24 February 2022 till their official ending are considered as extraordinary, unavoidable, and objective circumstances for business entities under agreements and contracts, certain tax liabilities, the duty of fulfilment of which emerged in accordance with the terms of the agreement/contract and the fulfilment of which became impossible in due time due to such *force majeure* circumstances.
Generally, the Ukrainian state bodies and courts keep functioning. At the same time, according to the recommendations of the Council of Judges of Ukraine, as well as certain relevant legislative acts adopted since the start of the war, (i) the work of the court should be determined based on the current situation in the region, (ii) the proceedings and hearings may be postponed by the court (except for urgent trials), and (iii) procedural terms shall be extended, if possible, at least until the end of martial law.
Some public registers do not function or function in a rather limited mode in the territories of active hostilities and/or temporarily occupied territories.
Payments abroad (with certain exceptions) are generally prohibited under the Resolution of the National Bank of Ukraine No. 18 as of 24 February 2022. During 2024, the National Bank of Ukraine extended the list of permitted payments abroad.
More details of the changes related to the introduction of martial law are provided in each respective section.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Unified social contribution (USC)
The USC basic rate (the contribution of a company that pays employment income/remuneration under civil agreements to individuals) is 22% of the gross remuneration.
The taxable base subject to the USC is capped per individual per month. Starting from 2018, the cap is set at 15 times the minimal wage set for the respective month (e.g. UAH 106,500 starting from 1 January 2024, UAH 120,000 starting from 1 April 2024).
According to Art. 39 of the State Budget Law for 2025, dated 19 November 2024, which comes into force on 1 January 2025, the USC cap will be set at 20 times the minimum salary (i.e. UAH 160,000 from 1 January 2025).
The minimal USC contribution is 22% of the minimal wage set as of the first day of the month of the salary payment (e.g. UAH 1,562 starting from 1 January 2024, UAH 1,760 starting from 1 April 2024).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
As of 1 January 2024, there are four VAT rates: 20%, 14%, 7%, and 0%.
The rate of 20% applies to almost all transactions subject to VAT except specific transactions subject to 14%, 7%, and 0% VAT.
The rate of 14% applies on transactions for the import and supply of certain agricultural products (products of plant origin, such as corn, soybeans, sunflower seeds, and certain other goods) in Ukraine.
The reduced rate of 7% applies to supply and import of registered medicines and specific medical goods, as well as medicines, medical goods, and medical equipment allowed to be used in clinical trials. It is also applied to several services of culture, tourism, and creative industries and supply of tickets to sporting events of international and Ukrainian level.
The 0% VAT rate applies to the export and re-export of goods and some other specific transactions (basically, it is a mechanism for providing exemption with credit).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Ukraine.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no gift or inheritance tax in Ukraine. However, income received as an inheritance or gift is subject to PIT at the following rates:
In addition, a stamp duty is payable by individuals, both Ukrainian and foreign nationals, on transfers of certain properties (e.g. real estate, cars) located/registered in Ukraine, whether the transfer is by way of gift or through inheritance.
## Real estate tax (RET)
Starting from 1 January 2015, almost all residential and non-residential property owned by individuals are subject to RET.
The tax base is determined based on the size of the total area of a real estate asset. There is a specific partial RET exemption for residential property for individuals, whereby the first 60 square metres for flats or 120 square metres for single residential dwellings are not subject to RET (180 square metres for different types of immovable property). Local governments may provide additional exemptions. Exemptions do not apply to assets (i) that exceed more than five times the area of potential exemption and/or (ii) used to generate income.
The RET rate is set by local governments but generally cannot exceed 1.5% of the minimal salary set on 1 January of the reporting year per square metre (for 2020, the maximum is UAH 70.85 per square metre; for 2021, the maximum is UAH 90 per square metre; for 2022, the maximum is UAH 97.50 per square metre; for 2023, the maximum is UAH 100.50 per square metre; for 2024, the maximum is UAH 106.50 per square metre; for 2025 the maximum is UAH 120 per square metre).
If the taxpayer has one or more residential properties with the total area of one asset being more than 300 square metres (for an apartment) or 500 square metres (for a house), the amount of calculated tax will be increased by UAH 25,000 per year for each such asset.
The tax must be paid by individuals within 60 days upon receipt of a tax assessment issued by tax authorities.
Tax non-resident individuals are allowed to rent out their property located in Ukraine only through Ukrainian tax agents.
## Transport tax
A local transport tax is charged on owners of passenger cars with an average market value exceeding 375 minimal salaries as of 1 January of the reporting year (i.e. UAH 2,662,500 for 2024, UAH 3 million for 2025) and less than five years old.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine is required to publish (on an annual basis, before 1 February of the reporting year) on its website a list of vehicles that are subject to the transportation tax (including brand, model, year of production, engine displacement, fuel type).
A tax of UAH 25,000 for each car per year should be paid by the car owner.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Corporate income tax (CIT) applies to taxable profits earned by resident entities in Ukraine and abroad and non-residents with a permanent establishment (PE) in Ukraine. Resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident entities are taxed on their Ukrainian-sourced income.
Ukraine's standard CIT rate is 18%. Starting from 1 January 2025, the basic CIT rate for the taxation of financial institutions (excluding insurance companies) is 25%. The CIT rate for banks’ profits for 2024 is 50%.
Withholding tax (WHT) at a rate of 15% applies to the majority of passive income payments to non-residents, unless an exemption or reduced rate is provided under a DTT. Ukraine has 71 effective DTTs in place.
Please note that Ukraine denounced its DTTs with Russian Federation in May 2022 and with Belarus in November 2022 and with Syria in September 2023, which have since ceased to be in force.
## Special CIT rates for insurance and gambling activities
### Insurance activities
In addition to the general CIT at the 18% rate, insurance companies also pay special CIT of 0% and 3% on their income. Long-term life insurance premiums, insurance premiums under voluntary pension programmes, and voluntary medical insurance premiums are subject to the 0% rate; the 3% rate applies to all other insurance premiums (excluding reinsurance contributions, premiums, and payments) received by the insurance company. Such amounts of CIT due at 0% or 3% reduce the CIT base of an insurance company, which is subject to the standard 18% rate.
### Gambling activities
Organisation of lotteries is subject to an additional CIT at a 28% rate in 2020 and 30% rate for the period starting from 1 January 2021; operating of gambling machines is subject to a 10% rate; and an 18% rate applies to bookmakers and other gambling activities (including casinos). Contrary to CIT for insurance companies, amounts of CIT of 10% or 18% paid from gambling income do not reduce taxable profit of a company engaged in gambling activities (standard 18% rate is applied to the full amount of the taxable profit).
## Local income taxes
No CIT is levied at the regional or local level, except simplified (unified) tax (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](ukraine/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for a description of simplified [unified] tax*).

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
There are four VAT rates: 20%, 14%, 7%, and 0%.
The rate of 20% applies to all transactions subject to VAT except specific transactions subject to 14%, 7%, and 0% VAT.
The rate of 14% applies to import and supply of certain agricultural products (products of plant origin, such as corn, soybeans, sunflower seeds, and certain other goods) in Ukraine.
The reduced rate of 7% applies to supply and import of qualifying medicines and specific medical goods, as well as medicines, medical goods, and medical equipment for use in clinical trials, cultural/artistic events, such as excursions in museums, zoos, and reserves, visiting their territories and objects, distribution of films adapted in Ukrainian version for people with vision or hearing disorder, temporary accommodation services, and supply of tickets for sport events of international and Ukrainian level.
The 0% VAT rate applies to export and re-export of goods. The 0% rate also applies to the supply of international transportation (confirmed by a single international shipping document), toll manufacturing services (if the finished goods are then re-exported from Ukraine), and certain other services.
Provision of services to a non-resident is not considered to be zero-rated. Such services are subject to 20% VAT or considered to be outside the scope of VAT (effectively exempt with no input VAT recovery), depending on the place of supply as determined by the legislation.
Transactions that are subject to VAT include the following:
Starting from 1 January 2022, B2C supplies of digital services to Ukrainian-based customers by non-residents are subject to 20% VAT, unless a specific VAT exemption applies (as of now, only some online education services may potentially be exempt). For these purposes, 'digital services' are defined as services supplied via the Internet automatically using information technologies and mostly without interaction of people, including in a way of installing special applications on smartphones, tablets, or other devices (subject to certain exceptions).
Transactions that are not subject to VAT include the following (among others):
Transactions that are VAT exempt include the following (among others):
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Starting from 17 March 2022 until the end of martial law, free provision / transfer of goods / services for the benefit of the Armed Forces and other bodies is not treated as supply for VAT purposes.
Starting from 16 April 2022 until the end of martial law, import and supply of certain goods (metal plates, reinforced glass, optical and communication equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, armoured vehicles, etc.) is exempt from VAT provided the final recipient of those goods are law enforcement agencies, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, and voluntary formations of territorial communities.
Until the end of martial law, import of certain goods (mostly for military purposes, e.g. optical and communication equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles) is exempt from VAT.
### VAT registration
Tax registration as a VAT payer is compulsory if the volume of an entity's taxable transactions exceeds the compulsory registration threshold. The current registration threshold is UAH 1 million for the past 12 consecutive months. An entity qualifying as a taxable entity should register with the tax authorities at the place of its location and obtain a VAT registration number.
Voluntary VAT registration is available prior to achievement of the mentioned threshold. The application for VAT registration may be submitted simultaneously with the application for the state registration of the legal entity.
Starting from 1 January 2022, non-residents supplying B2C digital services to Ukrainian-based customers have to register for VAT if the amount of their VATable operations exceed VAT registration threshold (UAH 1 million for the previous calendar year). Also, voluntary VAT registration is available prior to achievement of the mentioned threshold.
Non-residents (including those registered for VAT due to supply of B2C digital services in favour of Ukrainian-based customers) are not allowed to recover input VAT.
### Electronic VAT administration
A special electronic administration system, which includes VAT accounts for all VAT payers in the State Treasury, is used for settlement of VAT to the budget. Both VAT output and VAT input should be reflected in this system. For these purposes, VAT accounting documents (VAT invoices) are issued electronically and subject to mandatory registration by the taxpayer.
The aim of this system is to make VAT input of the customers (i.e. VAT payers) guaranteed by payment of VAT liabilities by the suppliers. VAT input on domestic purchases can be recognised by the taxpayer only if the supplier issued a duly registered VAT invoice. In order to register a VAT invoice, the supplier should have sufficient balance in the electronic VAT administration system (e.g. sufficient amount of input VAT). Otherwise, it may be required to transfer cash to the VAT account (i.e. to prepay its VAT liabilities).
Registration of a VAT invoice can be suspended by the tax authorities under the procedure prescribed by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Taxpayers that are not able to register VAT invoices/adjustment calculations are exempt from potential penalties and are required to register all VAT invoices/adjustment calculations unregistered due to martial law within six months after martial law is lifted or within 60 days from the first day of the month after the month of return of ability to register VAT invoices/adjustment calculations.
### VAT recovery and refunds
Generally, VAT incurred by a registered entity on the purchase and/or importation of goods and services used for the purpose of its own business (except for VAT incurred in relation to exempt supply) may be recovered by way of a credit against output VAT. If the VAT credit exceeds VAT output, a VAT refund is available in the form of a cash payment.
VAT refunds should be performed in a chronological order based on sequence of claims reflected in a registry maintained by the tax authorities and published on their official website.
Starting from 1 July 2024, a VAT refund should be provided within 26 calendar days following the deadline for submission of the VAT return unless a field tax audit has been assigned. In this case, the term for provision of VAT refund is extended for at least 30 days.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
The amount of input VAT related to the goods that were destroyed (lost) during the war cannot be refunded in cash (it can be only used to reduce future VAT liabilities).
However, if there is a delay in providing the refund in cash due to *force majeure* circumstances, the taxpayers will not be able to claim late payment interest as such mechanism has been temporarily disabled.
### VAT returns
VAT returns must be filed by the taxpayer on a monthly basis in electronic form. Monthly tax returns are due within 20 calendar days following the end of the reporting month. The amount of tax payable is assessed on the basis of tax returns and is due within ten calendar days following the deadline for filing the relevant tax returns.
VAT liabilities declared by Ukrainian residents are paid to the state budget fund in Ukrainian hryvnia through a special VAT account based on the registers submitted to the State Treasury by the tax authorities.
Non-residents supplying B2C digital services to Ukrainian-based customers have to submit simplified quarterly VAT returns within 40 calendar days following the end of the reporting quarter. The amount of tax payable is assessed on the basis of tax returns and is due within 30 calendar days following the deadline for filing the relevant tax returns.
VAT liabilities declared by non-residents under simplified VAT returns are paid to the budget in euros (EUR) or United States dollars (USD).
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Until martial law is lifted or cancelled, VAT payers are relieved from responsibility if they are unable to file a VAT return.
Until the termination or abolition of martial law, VAT payers are not entitled to submit downward adjustments (i.e. reducing tax payable and/or increasing claimed VAT refund) to VAT returns for the reporting periods until February 2022.
## Customs duty
Currently, there are three duty rates: preferential, relieved, and full rates. Preferential rates apply to goods originating from the countries with which Ukraine has concluded free trade agreements (FTAs). Relieved rates of duty apply to goods originating from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) countries and countries that have granted Ukraine ‘most favored nation’ trade status. Full rates of duty apply to the goods originating from all other countries or where the country of origin cannot be determined (is unknown).
The European Commission suspended import duties on all Ukrainian exports to the European Union for one year. The duty-free trade regime will be valid for Ukraine until 5 June 2025. The United Kingdom reduced all tariffs on goods imported from Ukraine and removed all quotas under the FTA.
Ukraine has concluded FTAs with the countries/members of the European Union, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, and such countries as Canada, Georgia, Israel, Macedonia, Montenegro, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Turkey (in the process of ratification by governments). These agreements allow the importation of a variety of goods into Ukraine with 0% duty (or with preferential rates of duty), subject to compliance with preferential rules of origin.
From August 2020, Ukrainian companies may obtain the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO). The AEO programme was developed in Ukraine in accordance with EU legislation. The obtainment of AEO status will simplify the customs clearance procedures, provide significant optimisation of time, speed up the logistics, and increase security of international supplies. AEO status also gives opportunities for improving general quality control, management of internal processes, protection of data, and commercial information.
From October 2022, Ukraine also became a member of the Convention on a Common Transit Procedure (NCTS) and to the Convention on the Simplification of Formalities in Trade in Goods.
Ukraine, as a candidate for the European Union and a participant to the NCTS, has implemented the model of electronic transit declarations in NCTS Phase 5. From 1 November 2023, users of the common transit procedure fill out a new T1 electronic transit declaration. The maximum number of goods that can be declared in one NCTS Phase 5 transit declaration has been increased from 999 to about 99,000. According to statistics provided on the Customs Authorities resources in 2023, 41,000 transit declarations were issued under the joint transit procedure, and 23,500 in the first quarter of 2024.
Starting from 1 December 2023, the European Union and Ukraine will introduce Alternative Rules of Origin at the bilateral level.
In particular, the agreement provides for the introduction of new terms in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System such as ’interchangeable goods‘, ’maximum content of materials originating in third countries‘, ’groups‘, and ’items‘. The list of goods that are fully sourced in the countries party to the Convention has also been updated. It is envisaged to use only two documents to confirm the origin: the EUR.1 certificate and the declaration of origin instead of four (EUR-MED documents are excluded), which will simplify the procedure for confirming the origin. In addition, the validity of documents of origin has been extended from four months to ten months. The list of documents required to confirm the origin of materials/raw materials used in the production of finished goods has been clarified, in particular, the supplier's declaration and the long-term supplier's declaration. The mechanism for granting the status of an authorised (approved) exporter has also been simplified.
On 10 April 2024, the updated Free Trade Agreement between Ukraine and Canada was ratified. The agreement includes special new chapters on cross-border trade in services, financial services, investment, temporary entry for business, telecommunications, trade and gender, trade and small and medium-sized enterprises, trade and indigenous peoples, and good regulatory practices.
On 7 May 2024, a draft law on the ratification of the Free Trade Agreement between Ukraine and the Republic of Turkey was approved. The agreement creates additional opportunities for the development of trade relations due to preferential conditions for access to the markets of goods and services of both countries, ensuring greater transparency in regulatory issues, reducing business operating costs by removing barriers to trade, and, as a result, increasing the efficiency of the development of national economies.
On 16 May 2024, the Law of Ukraine ’On amendments to the Customs Code of Ukraine and other laws of Ukraine regarding the peculiarities of customs control and customs clearance of certain categories of goods‘ came into force, which resumed from 1 May 2024 for an unused period documentary audits of compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine on customs matters, including regarding the timeliness, reliability, completeness of accrual and payment of customs duties,  counter reconciliations started and not completed before 24 February 2022, except for documentary audits, counter reconciliations for which a moratorium is established. Quarterly schedules of documentary scheduled on-site inspections of the customs authority will be published on the official website of the central executive body that implements state customs policy by the 15th day of the last month of the quarter preceding the quarter in which such documentary scheduled on-site inspections will be conducted.
On 17 October 2024, the Law of Ukraine 'On amendments to the Customs Code of Ukraine on the implementation of certain provisions of the Customs Code of the European Union' was signed. This Law is introducing European practises and standards in the customs affairs in Ukraine and intended to approximate the national customs legislation according to the European Union, and also to clarify certain provisions of the customs law. Most of the changes come into force on 19 April 2025, but some provisions have already entered into force on 19 October 2024, in particular, to expand the advantage of the AEO status in terms of priority passage through the customs border using information and communication systems that regulate the order of arrival at the state border and/or its crossing.
On 31 October 2024, the Law of Ukraine 'On amendments to the Customs Code of Ukraine to establish the peculiarities of service in customs authorities and certification of customs officials' entered into force. The law provides for changes in the service in the customs authorities in order to increase its effectiveness and transparency, which provide for significant adjustments in the procedures for the selection, management, and evaluation of the activities of the State Customs Service of Ukraine.
On 17 November 2024, the Law of Ukraine 'On ratification of Decision No. 1/2023 of the Joint Committee of the Regional Convention on Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Preferential Rules of Origin of 7 December 2023 on amendments to the Regional Convention on Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Preferential Rules of Origin' was adopted. The updated rules on the origin of goods come into force on 1 January 2025.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Importation of goods for military purposes as a humanitarian aid is allowed under simplified export control procedure.
Starting from 1 December 2023, Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 174 dated 1 March 2022 ’Certain Issues of Humanitarian Aid Passage through the Customs Border of Ukraine under Martial Law‘ will cease to be effective and with it the requirement to provide letters of guarantee from end users of humanitarian aid to the customs authorities when passing through the customs border of Ukraine.
All military and dual-use goods will be cleared on the customs border of Ukraine as humanitarian aid in accordance with the requirements of the new Procedure for the clearance and accounting of humanitarian aid under martial law, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 5 September 2023 No. 953.
To prevent abuse, the importation of humanitarian aid under the new rules will involve full digitalisation of related processes as follows:
#### Other important changes
## Excise taxes
Excise tax applies to certain goods imported to or produced in Ukraine. Excisable goods include ethyl alcohol, alcoholic beverages, beer, tobacco and tobacco products, liquids for e-cigarettes, cars, car bodies, motorbikes, liquefied gas, petrol, diesel fuel, other fuel material, and electric power.
The excise tax rates for fuel, alcohol products, all types of tobacco, cigarettes, raw tobacco, and tobacco waste, as well as the minimum excise tax on cigarettes, will gradually increase in order to align with the minimum EU rates for the respective products.
Ukraine has special electronic administration systems for excise tax on fuel and alcohol. These systems are aimed to control incoming and outgoing flows of fuel and alcohol in the market. The systems require entities to issue and register within the systems excise accounting documents (excise invoices) electronically on each operation of fuel and alcohol sale, their usage for the company’s needs, including for manufacturing purposes.
Starting from 1 January 2026, an electronic excise tax stamp (instead of a paper stamp) is introduced for alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and liquids used in electronic cigarettes.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
During the state of martial law, changes to the excise tax rules will apply, including:
## Tax on real estate other than land plots (real estate tax)
Owners of residential and non-residential property in Ukraine (both individuals and legal entities, including non-residents) are subject to local real estate tax (RET). The tax base is determined based on the size of the living space of a real estate asset.
Some types of property are exempt from RET, for example:
The RET rates are set by the local government but cannot exceed 1.5% of the minimal salary as of 1 January of the reporting year per square metre (for 2024 and 2025, the maximum is around UAH 120 per square metre).
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Starting from 2022, subject to certain conditions, no real estate tax shall be assessed and paid for:
Please note that all the conditions for eligibility and further details regarding the tax exemption can be found in the Tax Code of Ukraine.
## Land tax
Land tax is a local tax and assessed annually for the following year, paid monthly in equal instalments by the owners or users of the land. The rate of land tax depends on the category, location, and the existence of a state valuation for each particular land plot.
Starting from 1 January 2022, a minimal tax burden for agricultural producers on land plots was introduced. Minimal tax burden should be calculated as follows:
If the minimum tax burden is greater than the amount of other taxes paid by the taxpayer (CIT, personal income tax [PIT], land tax, etc.), the taxpayer will have to increase CIT in the income tax return accordingly.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
No land tax and no general minimum tax liability shall be assessed and paid for land plots where military operations are/were in progress or which are/were temporarily occupied by Russian armed units or defined by regional military administrations as those contaminated by explosive items from the beginning of 2022.
Please note that the list of such territories was established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
Also, for the period until martial law is terminated or cancelled, but no longer than 1 January 2026, no land tax should be paid for land plots on which residential and/or non-residential real estate property have been destroyed as a result of military actions.
For calculation of the minimum tax burden for 2025 and the subsequent years until the termination or cancellation of martial law in Ukraine, a coefficient of 5.7% is applied.
For the period starting from 1 January 2024 to December 31 of the year in which martial law is terminated or cancelled, the amount of the minimum tax liability cannot be less than UAH 700 per 1 hectare, and for land plots where arable land constitutes at least 50% of the area, the amount of the minimum tax liability cannot be less than UAH 1,400 per 1 hectare
## Transport tax
A local transport tax is charged on owners of passenger cars with an average market value exceeding 375 minimal salaries as of 1 January of the reporting year (i.e. UAH 3 million for 2025) and less than five years old.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine is required to publish (on an annual basis, before 1 February of the reporting year) on its website a list of vehicles that are subject to the transportation tax (including brand, model, year of production, engine displacement, fuel type).
A tax of UAH 25,000 for each car per year should be paid by the respective car owner.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is imposed on certain actions, including the notarisation of contracts. In most cases, the amounts involved are nominal.
Operations carried out at commodity exchanges and real estate sales incur a stamp duty of 1%.
## Payroll taxes
Employers and other business entities that pay income to individuals are defined as tax agents and are responsible for withholding PIT, military tax, and mandatory unified social contribution (USC) (*see below*) and remitting them to the state budget.
## Unified social contributions (USCs)
Employers (including representative offices of foreign companies in Ukraine) are required to pay USC in respect of their employees. USC applies to all salaries paid through the payroll of a Ukrainian entity or a Ukrainian representative office of a foreign entity, as well as remuneration paid to individuals under civil agreements.
The general USC rate (payable by the employer) is 22% (except for special decreased rates for contributions regarding disabled people, etc.), which applies to gross remuneration. The USC accrued by the employer is deductible for CIT purposes.
The taxable base for contributions is capped. The cap is set at 15 times the minimal salary; starting from 1 April 2024 the cap is UAH 120,000.
From 1 January 2025, the USC cap will be set at 20 times the minimum salary (i.e. from 1 January 2025, the cap will be UAH 160,000 and change along with the change of the minimum salary).
Employees are relieved from paying USC.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Those individual entrepreneurs who are registered as group 2 and 3 payers of unified tax and legal entities that are group 3 payers of unified tax shall be exempt from payment of USC in respect of their employees recruited/called to Ukrainian Armed Forces. These amounts shall be covered from the state budget funds.
## Special Pension Fund charges
The following special charges are payable to the State Pension Fund:
## Charges on environmental pollution
Environmental pollution charges (ecological taxes) are imposed on any legal entity that discharges contaminants into the environment (air or water) or disposes of waste. The actual rate depends on the type and toxicity of each contaminant.
Charges on environmental pollution are deductible for CIT purposes.
No environmental tax shall be assessed and paid from 2022 for assets located in areas where military operations are/were in progress or which are temporarily occupied by Russian armed units or defined by regional military administrations as those contaminated by explosive items.
Please note that the list of such territories was established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
## Charge for subsoil usage (rent)
Companies engaged in extracting mineral resources in Ukraine, regardless of the form of their ownership, are liable for a charge for use of subsoil.
Rent payment for subsoil use is calculated as follows:
= Value of extracted mineral resource \* Cost of respective unit of extracted mineral resource \* Tax rate (%) \* Adjustment coefficient
The value of extracted mineral resources is determined as the greater of the following two calculation methods:
Specific rules apply in determining the selling prices for extraction of oil, condensate, natural gas, and iron ore.
Adjustment coefficients may apply to the rent payment for subsoil use rates depending on the type of minerals and conditions of extraction. For example, coefficient 0.25 will be applied to the tax rate for iron ore extracted by underground mining methods with a depth of over 300 metres for the enrichment of magnetite iron content of less than 35%.
As of 2025, the charge for subsoil usage is as follows:
Within controlled transactions, the tax base for rent is determined based on the actual selling price of the mineral, which cannot be less than the price determined in accordance with the arm’s-length principle.
Charges for the use of subsoil are deductible for CIT purposes.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
## Other local taxes
According to the Tax Code, there are other local taxes that may be levied at the discretion of the local authorities (i.e. vehicle parking place duties, tourism duty).

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Unified social contribution (USC)
The USC basic rate (the contribution of a company that pays employment income/remuneration under civil agreements to individuals) is 22% of the gross remuneration.
The taxable base subject to the USC is capped per individual per month. Starting from 2018, the cap is set at 15 times the minimal wage set for the respective month (e.g. UAH 106,500 starting from 1 January 2024, UAH 120,000 starting from 1 April 2024).
According to Art. 39 of the State Budget Law for 2025, dated 19 November 2024, which comes into force on 1 January 2025, the USC cap will be set at 20 times the minimum salary (i.e. UAH 160,000 from 1 January 2025).
The minimal USC contribution is 22% of the minimal wage set as of the first day of the month of the salary payment (e.g. UAH 1,562 starting from 1 January 2024, UAH 1,760 starting from 1 April 2024).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
As of 1 January 2024, there are four VAT rates: 20%, 14%, 7%, and 0%.
The rate of 20% applies to almost all transactions subject to VAT except specific transactions subject to 14%, 7%, and 0% VAT.
The rate of 14% applies on transactions for the import and supply of certain agricultural products (products of plant origin, such as corn, soybeans, sunflower seeds, and certain other goods) in Ukraine.
The reduced rate of 7% applies to supply and import of registered medicines and specific medical goods, as well as medicines, medical goods, and medical equipment allowed to be used in clinical trials. It is also applied to several services of culture, tourism, and creative industries and supply of tickets to sporting events of international and Ukrainian level.
The 0% VAT rate applies to the export and re-export of goods and some other specific transactions (basically, it is a mechanism for providing exemption with credit).
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Ukraine.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no gift or inheritance tax in Ukraine. However, income received as an inheritance or gift is subject to PIT at the following rates:
In addition, a stamp duty is payable by individuals, both Ukrainian and foreign nationals, on transfers of certain properties (e.g. real estate, cars) located/registered in Ukraine, whether the transfer is by way of gift or through inheritance.
## Real estate tax (RET)
Starting from 1 January 2015, almost all residential and non-residential property owned by individuals are subject to RET.
The tax base is determined based on the size of the total area of a real estate asset. There is a specific partial RET exemption for residential property for individuals, whereby the first 60 square metres for flats or 120 square metres for single residential dwellings are not subject to RET (180 square metres for different types of immovable property). Local governments may provide additional exemptions. Exemptions do not apply to assets (i) that exceed more than five times the area of potential exemption and/or (ii) used to generate income.
The RET rate is set by local governments but generally cannot exceed 1.5% of the minimal salary set on 1 January of the reporting year per square metre (for 2020, the maximum is UAH 70.85 per square metre; for 2021, the maximum is UAH 90 per square metre; for 2022, the maximum is UAH 97.50 per square metre; for 2023, the maximum is UAH 100.50 per square metre; for 2024, the maximum is UAH 106.50 per square metre; for 2025 the maximum is UAH 120 per square metre).
If the taxpayer has one or more residential properties with the total area of one asset being more than 300 square metres (for an apartment) or 500 square metres (for a house), the amount of calculated tax will be increased by UAH 25,000 per year for each such asset.
The tax must be paid by individuals within 60 days upon receipt of a tax assessment issued by tax authorities.
Tax non-resident individuals are allowed to rent out their property located in Ukraine only through Ukrainian tax agents.
## Transport tax
A local transport tax is charged on owners of passenger cars with an average market value exceeding 375 minimal salaries as of 1 January of the reporting year (i.e. UAH 2,662,500 for 2024, UAH 3 million for 2025) and less than five years old.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine is required to publish (on an annual basis, before 1 February of the reporting year) on its website a list of vehicles that are subject to the transportation tax (including brand, model, year of production, engine displacement, fuel type).
A tax of UAH 25,000 for each car per year should be paid by the car owner.

# Ukraine
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Taxable period
The reporting year for companies generally follows the calendar year. The exception is for qualified agricultural manufacturers (other than on simplified [unified] tax), whose reporting period starts from 1 July of the current reporting year and ends on 30 June of the next reporting year.
## Tax returns
Tax returns for CIT should generally be submitted on a quarterly basis, but some taxpayers will have to submit them annually (newly established, agricultural producers, and taxpayers with prior year annual income equal to or less than UAH 40 million net of indirect taxes).
Monthly returns (e.g. VAT, 2% simplified [unified] tax) must be filed within 20 calendar days following the end of the respective reporting month.
Quarterly returns are due within 40 calendar days following the last day of the reporting quarter. However, the deadline for submitting a fourth quarter CIT return (on a quarterly reporting period basis) is 60 calendar days after the reporting year-end; this term also applies for other annual returns (including CIT returns on a yearly reporting period basis).
Taxpayers also have to submit financial statements to the tax authorities.
Resident companies and non-resident entities with a PE in Ukraine must keep records that comply with the tax rules.
## Payment of tax
Taxes payable assessed on the basis of tax returns are due within ten calendar days following the deadline for filing the relevant tax returns.
Starting from 1 January 2021, a unified tax account is enabled. It is now possible to pay CIT, PIT, and USC through a unified tax account, as well as other payments, the control of which is entrusted to the State Tax Service. Please note, such account is not used for payments of VAT and excise tax on fuel and alcohol.
Once in a year, the taxpayer has the right to notify (via electronic cabinet) of the choice either to use or terminate a unified tax account.
### Penalties
The tax authorities will charge significant penalties for late filing, late payment, or understating tax liabilities.
Late payment of tax may result in a penalty in the amount of 10% of the underpaid amount for delays of up to 30 calendar days (20% if the delay exceeds this).
If the tax liabilities are understated, the amount of penalty depends on the frequency of violations (i.e. understatement of CIT and VAT liabilities, overstatement of VAT refunds) during a period of 1,095 consecutive calendar days. In particular: 10% for the first innocent violation, 25% for the first intentional violatiоn, and 50% for the second intentional violation and each subsequent violation related to the same taxes (75% may also be applied for the third and subsequent violation of WHT and payroll taxes).
In addition to the abovementioned penalties, late payment interest (LPI) is calculated based on 100%/120% of the prime rate of the National Bank of Ukraine. The rules for calculation of LPI are vaguely worded and are open to interpretation.
If a taxpayer fails to withhold tax when required, a penalty of up to 75% of the deficient tax is imposed.
If the taxpayer fails to register VAT invoices, penalties are up to 150% of the VAT amount (100% if the customer complains and the supplier does not follow the tax authorities' prescriptions within deadlines). If the taxpayer fails to register excise tax invoices, penalties are up to 40% of the excise tax amount due on the supply of the respective excisable goods.
Potential criminal responsibility could be claimed against the taxpayer’s management if the total amount of additional tax liabilities assessed by the tax authorities during the tax audit exceeds 3,000 times the amount that is equal to 50% of the statutory subsistence minimum for able-bodied individuals (i.e. UAH 4,542,000 of additional tax liabilities for 2024). There are several options to close such criminal proceedings (the procedure should be properly managed from the legal perspective).
If the taxpayer identifies and self-adjusts understated tax liabilities, such taxpayer is required to self-assess penalties of 3% or 5%, depending on the way in which the adjustment was made.
Non-resident legal entity that conducts activities in Ukraine through a separate business unit (including a PE) without registering with Ukrainian tax authorities will be charged with penalties of UAH 100,000.
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
During the period of martial law:
## Standard audit file (SAF-T UA)
Starting from August 2021, an obligation for large taxpayers to submit a standard audit file (SAF-T UA) was established by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. Formally, the tax authorities may request an SAF-T UA from large taxpayers during audits already from this date.
The structure of the SAF-T UA consists of the following sections:
In 2022, the State Tax Service of Ukraine has published the Detailed Technical Description Elements of SAF-T UA; however, it is expected that the current version of such description may be amended in the future. Since then, the tax authorities have already published a few updates on the SAF-T UA structure.
At the request of the tax authorities during the audit, large taxpayers must provide an SAF-T UA within two working days after receiving the request.
It is expected that an SAF-T UA will become a regular annual tax reporting for large taxpayers from 2025 and for all VAT payers from 2027. For non-submission and violation of the SAF-T UA filing procedure, the draft law stipulates penalties in the amount of:
However, the respective draft law has not been considered by the Ukrainian Parliament yet.
## Tax audit process
Due to the war in Ukraine, the tax authorities had been prohibited to start all types of tax audits of taxpayers since 3 March 2022. On 8 December 2023, all types of tax audits were resumed with minor limitations.
According to the Tax Code, the tax authorities may carry out scheduled audits once a year. Taxpayers must be notified of the audit in writing at least ten days in advance. The State Tax Service is required to release a schedule of planned audits for the following year on its official website by 25 December of the year preceding the year when such audits are to be conducted.
The schedule could be reviewed on a monthly basis. Tax audit of the companies included in the schedule after its initial publication could be started not sooner than two months after publication of the changes to the schedule (for some types of businesses this term is decreased to 30 days).
The following companies could be a subject for a scheduled tax audit in 2024:
The levels of payment of the relevant tax by industry and the indicators of the average salary in the relevant industry by region, formed on the basis of the indicators based on the results of the 2021 calendar year, are published on the official website of the State Tax Service of Ukraine. When forming the plan-schedule for conducting a scheduled document audit for 2024, indicators of positive dynamics of the level of tax payment in 2023 should have been taken into account.
In addition, the tax authorities could perform actual, off-site and out-of-schedule audits in certain circumstances (e.g. if a tax violation has been identified, a taxpayer does not file tax returns on a timely basis, or during the counter-check it fails to provide the tax office with all documents specified in the request).
The moratorium on tax audits is not cancelled for:
As of the end of October 2024, the Ukrainian tax authorities have already conducted 10,707 tax audits. According to the official statistics of the State Tax Service of Ukraine, the total amount of accrued tax liabilities is UAH 37,103,563,000.
As of December 2024, there are no legislative initiatives regarding the specifics of conducting scheduled audits in 2025 during martial law in Ukraine. Presumably, scheduled audits will be carried out in accordance with the general provisions of the Tax Code of Ukraine.
At the same time, on 18 June 2024, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted Law No. 11084, known as the 'Law on the White Business Club'. The law introduces a special club for businesses that comply with tax laws in good faith, encouraging voluntary tax payments and ensuring stable economic development.
Taxpayers who are included into the List of Taxpayers with a High Level of Voluntary Compliance with Tax Legislation are granted the following benefits:
- exclusively at the request of a taxpayer
- in terms of control over transfer pricing
- in connection with violation of the deadlines set for return of foreign currency earnings, or
- with respect to the taxpayers engaged in the activities with excisable products, gambling businesses, and those providing financial and payment services.
- production and/or sale of excise goods
- organisation and conduct of gambling, or
- providing financial and/or payment services.
## Statute of limitations
Under Ukrainian tax legislation, a three-year statute of limitations applies (1,095 days) on any outstanding Ukrainian tax liability, starting from the date a tax return is due to be filed and/or the date the tax is due to be paid, if assessed by the tax authorities. There is no limit on the statute of limitations in which an assessment may be made if a taxpayer has deliberately evaded taxation (if proven in court) or when a taxpayer fails to file a return.
The statute of limitations for transfer pricing controlled operations is seven years (2,555 days).
As a part of tax measures related to COVID-19, the statute of limitations was suspended for the period starting from 18 March 2020 and until the end of the quarantine period (30 June 2023).
In addition, the statute of limitation will lay off if there is one of the following conditions:
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
The duration of all statutes of limitation supervised by tax authorities is suspended for the duration of the martial law legal regime.
From 1 August 2023, the statute of limitations for scheduled and unscheduled audits remaining under the moratorium is suspended (with certain exceptions). *For more details, please refer to Tax audit process above.*
## Tax advice
The Ministry of Finance of Ukraine is authorised to issue summarising tax consultations in cases of inconsistency among various tax law provisions. Additionally, individual tax advice may be sought from the tax authorities, who are required to issue such clarifications.
Tax advice is not legally binding and may be challenged in court. A taxpayer may use the tax advice as guidance on the methodology to be applied by the taxpayer. In practice, the tax advice often does not provide solid protection against future assessment of tax, but it does protect from penalties.
A unified database of individual tax consultations was established in 2017 and administered by the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine with free unobstructed access to its records. All individual tax consultations issued by the tax authorities from 1 April 2017 and further on are to be entered into the database.
Currently, tax authorities are focusing on the following areas:
## Electronic taxpayer’s cabinet
An electronic taxpayer’s cabinet features the following functions:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Residents are taxed on their worldwide income, subject to the restrictions set forth by any applicable DTT.
Non-residents are subject to Ukrainian tax only in respect of their Ukrainian-source income (this, for example, includes income received by the individual from their employer, either resident or non-resident, in relation to employment exercised in Ukraine) or, under conditions, investment profit from operation with non-Ukrainian investment assets if the issuers own Ukrainian subsidiaries.
The same tax rates generally apply to tax residents and non-residents (with certain exceptions).
## Personal income tax rates
The standard tax rate of 18% applies to income received as salary and other benefits under employment and civil agreements, foreign income, and other income not covered elsewhere.
Taxable income received from abroad is subject to a tax rate of 18%, with some exceptions.
The 18% rate also applies to all passive income (e.g. interest, dividends, royalties, investment profit), unless specified otherwise by a special article (*see the [Income determination](ukraine/individual/income-determination.html) section*). Dividends paid by resident CIT payers (except mutual investment institutions) are taxed at 5%. Dividends paid by non-residents, mutual investment funds, and non-payers of CIT in Ukraine are taxed at 9%. Dividends that are 'not ordinary dividends' are taxed like salary (i.e. at 18%).
Income earned by tax non-residents from sources in Ukraine should be subject to tax under the same order and rates as those for tax residents, unless otherwise specified by the Tax Code.
## Military tax rates
A temporary 1.5% military tax on personal income was introduced in August 2014. This is effective until the reformation of the Ukrainian Military Forces is completed. The completion should be confirmed by the respective decision of the Parliament.
Tax base for the military tax is the same as for PIT (with some exceptions) and is not capped.
Ukrainian employers and other tax agents are responsible for tax withholding. Military tax from income not withheld by a tax agent should be payable on a self-assessment basis within the deadlines for PIT.
For the updates introduced by the Law 4015-IX, dated 10 October 2024, please refer to *Military tax**in the [Significant developments](ukraine/individual/significant-developments.html) section*.
Income of individuals accrued for the periods before the Law 4015-IX came into force ( i.e. before 1 December 2024) shall be taxed at the military tax rate in effect prior to the entry into force of this Law (i.e. 1.5%), regardless of the date of their actual payment (grant), except for cases expressly provided for by the Tax Code of Ukraine.

# Ukraine
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Taxable period
The reporting period for individuals follows the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Every individual is taxed on their own income. Tax shall be deducted at the source in most cases. There is no aggregation of income for spouses, and returns are to be filed separately by married persons.
An individual is obligated to file a tax return with the local tax authorities (where the individual resides/is registered in Ukraine) if they receive income during the year:
Additionally, tax residents, including those whose income was subject to final taxation at the source, also have the right to file a tax return if they wish to claim a tax credit (deduction) in respect of certain expenses incurred during the year and/or claim a foreign tax credit in Ukraine.
The standard annual filing deadline is 30 April of the year following the reporting year. It can be extended to 31 December based on an application from the taxpayer if the documents for a foreign tax credit need to be obtained from a foreign jurisdiction.
If a person plans to depart Ukraine, the tax resident must submit a ‘departure tax declaration’ no less than 60 days prior to their departure and settle the tax due based on an assessment issued by the tax authorities. Theoretically, filing a departure tax return does not allow an individual to avoid filing an annual tax return.
Private entrepreneurs under the general tax regime are obligated to file tax returns by 30 April of the year following the reporting year and should declare all kinds of income (i.e. from entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial activities).
Private entrepreneurs registered for a simplified tax regime are obligated to report the amount of income received and tax paid during the reporting period on a quarterly or annual basis. Also, monthly reporting may apply under the martial law regime.
## Payment of tax
Tax in respect of employment or other income paid by a tax agent (i.e. a Ukrainian entity or a representative office of a foreign company in Ukraine) must be withheld at the source. The tax is payable at the time of the income payment. When the income is received in-kind or from the cash desk, the tax is payable within three banking days.
If income is accrued but not paid, the common approach is that the tax has to be transferred to the Treasury within 20 calendar days after the month when such accrual took place.
Tax liability due on a submitted tax return must be paid by the individual on a self-assessment basis by 31 July of the year following the reporting year, irrespective of whether the filing extension was applied for or not. Tax liability additionally calculated by the tax authorities should be paid by the deadline indicated in the tax assessment issued by the tax authorities. Some specific deadlines also exist in rare cases (e.g. quarterly payments of PIT and military tax from rental income that is not received from a tax agent).
The 2024 tax payment deadline is 31 July 2025.
PIT should be paid in Ukrainian local currency, hryvnia. There is no mechanism for payment of PIT in foreign currency, or directly from abroad.
Overpayment of PIT should be returned to the taxpayer within 60 calendar days from the date of filing the tax return. Upon a taxpayer's request, the overpayment may be offset against future tax liabilities.
Private entrepreneurs under the general tax regime are obligated to pay an advance tax in four instalments throughout the year. The final tax payment is due based on the tax return.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Several changes became effective from 1 January 2022 related to the following areas:
On 14 August 2021, the Law of Ukraine 1667-IX 'On Stimulating the Development of the Digital Economy in Ukraine' entered into force. The purpose of the Law 1667-IX is creation of a special legal regime for the IT industry in Ukraine called 'Diia City'.
On 14 December 2021, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the Law of Ukraine 'On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine to Stimulate the Digital Economy in Ukraine', which is a tax part of the 'Diia City' special legal regime and provides special tax conditions for residents of the City. The law entered into force on 1 January 2022.
Ukraine denounced its double tax treaties (DTTs) with Russia Federation in May 2022 and with Belarus in November 2022, which have since ceased to be in force.
On 19 August 2022, Ukrainian tax authorities acceded to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information. Thereby Ukraine joins the international framework for automatic exchange of tax-related information on financial accounts of taxpayers under the rules on the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information (CRS). The first exchange of information is expected to be done in 2024 with respect to new accounts opened after 1 July 2023 and individuals' High Value Accounts.
## Diia City: Special legal and tax regime for IT companies in Ukraine
Starting from 2021 the 'Diia City' (a special legal and tax regime for IT companies in Ukraine) started working. This regime is created for the purpose of stimulating the development of the IT sector in Ukraine. Benefits of 'Diia City' include:
## Increased corporate income tax (CIT) rate for banks and financial institutions
The CIT rate for banks' and financial institutions’ profits is increased.
The main provisions of the Law ’On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine on the Specifics of Taxation of Banks and Other Taxpayers‘ No. 3474-IX and Law “On amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine and other laws of Ukraine to ensure balanced budget revenues during the period of martial law” No. 4015-IX, which were adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on 21 November 2023 and 10 October 2024, respectively, are the following:
## Advance CIT payments to be paid by fuel trade retailers
Starting from December 2024, fuel trade retailers are obliged to pay advance CIT payments for each place of retail fuel trade included in the Unified Register of Licensees and Places of Circulation. Advance CIT payments are to be made on a monthly basis not later than the 20th day of the reporting month.
The following amounts of the advance CIT payment are prescribed (per each place of retail fuel trade):
The amount of CIT advance payments paid during the reporting (tax) period reduces the overall CIT liabilities of the taxpayer for such reporting (tax) period defined at the general CIT rate of 18%, in the amount that does not exceed the amount of the accrued CIT liability for such tax (reporting) period.
The amount of the advance CIT payments that exceeds the overall CIT liability:
In case of non-payment/late payments of the advance CIT payments, the fuel trade retailer is subject to liability in accordance with current Ukrainian tax legislation, with the application of financial penalties.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Corporate residence is determined by the place of incorporation.
However, starting from 1 January 2022, legal entities that are established under the laws of other countries, but have an effective management in Ukraine, are recognised as CIT payers in Ukraine on a general basis.
Importantly, such CIT payers should not be taxed with respect to their foreign income.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Ukrainian definition of a PE generally follows the PE definition from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention, but with stronger agency tests.
In particular, a non-resident’s PE is defined as a fixed place of business through which the business activity of a non-resident entity is wholly or partly carried out in Ukraine. A PE includes, among other things, a place of management, affiliate, office, server, etc.
The Tax Code contains the concept of a service PE whereby the provision of services (apart from the provision of personnel), including consultancy services, by a non-resident through its employees or other personnel in Ukraine, shall constitute a Ukrainian PE of this non-resident, provided such activities (within the framework of one project) last more than 183 days in any 12-month period.
A construction site in Ukraine may also give rise to a taxable presence of a non-resident in Ukraine in the form of a PE if the length of the construction activities (within one or few related projects) performed by a non-resident through its employees or other attracted personnel exceeds 12 months.
The Tax Code also provides for the concept of a non-dependent agent, which means, specifically, a Ukrainian agent acting on behalf of more than one non-resident in the ordinary course of its business should not constitute a PE in Ukraine.
Still, there is a list of exclusions from the PE definition. In particular, according to the Tax Code, auxiliary and preparatory services of a non-resident, as well as their combination, should not result in the creation of a PE. However, in practice, the Ukrainian tax authorities usually interpret the term ‘business activity’ in a very broad sense, and, without the DTT protection, may consider any type of activity as giving rise to a taxable presence (i.e. a PE) of a foreign entity in Ukraine.
At the same time, a PE of a non-resident may also be recognised if several non-resident related parties carry out activities in Ukraine and such activities together go beyond the preparatory or auxiliary nature for such group of non-residents. However, this applies only to cases when the activities of non-resident related parties in Ukraine together constitute closely related functions of a business process.
Moreover, if the activity of a non-resident triggers creation of the PE, the Ukrainian tax authorities have the right to perform a mandatory registration of such non-resident for tax purposes in Ukraine. A non-resident carrying out business activities in Ukraine via its PE should also get registered with Ukrainian tax authorities as a CIT payer.
Note that transactions performed between a non-resident and its PE in Ukraine are considered controlled for transfer pricing purposes if their value exceeds UAH 10 million (net of indirect taxes) for the corresponding tax (reporting) year.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Assets whose values are more than UAH 20,000 that have a useful life exceeding one year are required to be depreciated for tax purposes. Depreciation is determined on a monthly basis and computed using the following methods:
Fixed assets are divided into 16 groups according to their statutory minimal useful life. The useful life of fixed assets may be extended by the taxpayer.
The application of a reduced statutory minimum useful life is allowed to the following fixed assets, which are used in business activities of the taxpayer (subject to some exceptions):
Depreciation is not accrued for the period when a fixed asset is not used in business activities due to its modernisation, repairs, reconstruction, and conservation.
There are no special rules prescribed for tax accounting of repair costs in respect of production fixed assets and intangible assets. Ukrainian accounting principles or IFRS rules should apply. Expenses on repairs and reconstruction of non-production fixed assets and intangible assets are not deductible.
The following intangible assets may be amortised using one of the above-mentioned methods over the period of an asset's lifetime as defined in the documents certifying the rights to the intangibles and considering the minimum period set by the law:
Taxpayers are entitled to set the amortisation period of the intangible assets on their own, but it must not be less than two years and not more than ten years of continuous operation (this only applies when the documents establishing the right to use do not specify a term for the use). NPBT is adjusted by the amount(s) of residual value of written-off non-production equipment and intangible assets as per accounting data.
The abovementioned rules are not applied to the right-of-use assets recognised under the IFRS 16. At the same time, the above rules still apply to the assets under finance leasing, recognised under the Ukrainian accounting principles.
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not permitted (i.e. not deductible) for tax purposes.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
There is no limitation for deduction of organisational and start-up expenses incurred prior to the entity's registration (accounting rules should apply).
R&D expenses are deductible according to financial accounting rules.
## Interest expenses
Interest accrued is generally deductible for CIT purposes, but the deduction of interest expense is limited according to the thin capitalisation or transfer pricing rules (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debt / loss allowance
NPBT can be reduced by the amount of written-off debts/receivables that qualify as bad debts under the Tax Code (including the write-off, performed within the amount of bad debts provision). The Tax Code contains the detailed list of criteria for debts to be qualified as bad ones.
### Loan loss provisions (LLPs) for banks and other financial institutions
Banks and other financial institutions create LLPs according to IFRS. The expenses from the write-off of bad debts are deductible in the period when criteria for recognition of bad debt is met.
## Other reserves (provisions)
Deduction of provisions for vacation and salary payments are allowed in the period of accrual.
Deduction of other provisions for future costs (i.e. warranty, contingent liabilities, etc.) are disallowed in the period of accrual. Respective expenses covered by these provisions (except vacation and salary payments) are deductible when actually incurred.
## Charitable contributions
Only 70% of payments for goods or services to non-profit organisations (except budgetary ones) is tax deductible.
The deductibility of the costs of goods or services supplied for free to non-profit organisations is limited by 4% of the previous year’s taxable profit (by 8% of the previous year’s taxable profit in respect of payments to non-profit organisations in the sphere of sport, physical culture, and physical culture education).
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Due to the introduction of martial law in 2022, the following changes are applied and remain relevant until the abolition of martial law:
## Pension expenses
The obligatory Ukrainian social security insurance contributions, including state pension contributions charged on payroll expenses, are deductible for employers.
There are no limitations prescribed for the deduction of the employer’s payment to non-state pension organisations (financial accounting rules should apply).
## Payment for directors
Payments (including bonuses) relating to business are normally deductible payments.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and forfeits, which were accrued in accordance with civil legislation for the benefit of entities that are not CIT payers (except for private individuals) or that are taxed at a 0% CIT rate, are not tax deductible.
Fines, penalties, and late payment interest accrued by tax and other regulating authorities for violation of provisions of Ukrainian legislation are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
CIT and VAT incurred on purchases are not deductible. VAT is deductible if it cannot be recovered.
WHT and PIT withheld by a tax agent from the income paid are not deductible, as the whole amount of payment itself may be treated as expenses for CIT purposes.
WHT paid at the cost of the taxpayer (i.e. not withheld from the amount of income paid to a non-resident) is deductible for CIT purposes.
Other taxes not mentioned above are generally deductible in full.
## Other significant items
There is no requirement to prove the connection of costs to the company’s 'business activities'. The exception is the need to differentiate between business and non-business fixed assets.
Another exception is the need to have a business purpose for expenses incurred in transactions with non-residents. The burden of proving the absence of business purpose in the transactions rests on the tax authorities. Business purpose of the transaction exists if:
General requirements for the documentation of the transactions for accounting needs (i.e. contracts, acts of acceptance, etc.) will also apply for the substantiation of expenses for tax purposes.
Non-repayable financial aid (goods, services), which was provided free of charge for the benefit of its recipients (other than duly registered non-profit organisations) that are not CIT payers or that are taxed at a 0% CIT rate, is not deductible.
Starting from 1 January 2022, the amount of irrevocable financial aid provided to taxpayers - related parties (if the recipient of the irrevocable financial aid declares a negative value for the object of taxation for the tax (reporting) year preceding the year in which this irrevocable financial aid was provided (provided that such aid was included in the cost) is not tax deductible.
Temporarily, up to 1 January 2035, there is a CIT exemption provided for income received by investors with significant investments. Taxpayers can use this regime during five consistent years after receiving status of investors with significant investments. The amount of the potential tax benefit is limited and correlated with the investments made.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward with certain limitations for large taxpayers. In particular, large taxpayers may utilise only up to 50% of accumulated tax losses from previous reporting (tax) years in their current tax return. The amount of not utilised tax losses is carried forward to the future periods until their full utilisation. If the amount of tax losses is less than 10% of the positive tax base, such tax losses may be utilised in full.
Ukrainian tax legislation does not provide for refunds for losses carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The following rules need to be followed with regard to payments to foreign affiliates:
The first and the second of the above limitations do not apply if the transaction is controlled for transfer pricing purposes. Even if the transaction is uncontrolled, the limitations can be waived if a taxpayer confirms the arm’s-length level of payments in accordance with the transfer pricing rules.
The latter limitation should apply at any case (even if the payments are at 'arm's-length' level).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
In Ukraine, each legal entity is taxed individually.
## Transfer pricing
### Controlled transactions
The transfer pricing rules apply for CIT purposes only. The list of controlled transactions for transfer pricing purposes includes business transactions that may have an impact on taxable profits and that are:
In addition, starting from 23 May 2020, the transfer (full or partial) of functions from one counterparty to another that leads to a decrease in the income/financial result of a Ukrainian taxpayer (in cases where in a relationship between unrelated parties such transfer would not have taken place without compensation) is also subject to transfer pricing rules.
Notes
1. Starting from 1 January 2025, the following two new criteria for determining related parties are introduced:
2. Starting from 1 January 2025, to replace the prior ones, the following new criteria are established for the inclusion of states (territories) in the relevant list of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (so called 'low-tax' jurisdictions):
3. Starting from 1 January 2025, two new conditions are introduced (instead of the prior one - payment of CIT by the non-resident in the reporting year in the country of its registration), and, if at least one of them is met, the taxpayer's transactions with the non-resident, whose organisational and legal form is included in such a list, are recognised as uncontrolled (in the absence of other criteria):
Such status must be confirmed by an appropriate certificate, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Tax Code of Ukraine, and submitted to the State Tax Service by 1 October of the year following the reporting year.
Transactions with the same counterparty are considered to be controlled if the total annual amount of the transactions with any counterparty (calculated according to accounting rules) exceeds UAH 10 million (net of indirect taxes), provided the total annual income (calculated according to the accounting rules) of the taxpayer received as a result of any type of activity exceeds UAH 150 million (net of indirect taxes).
Transactions performed between a non-resident and its PE in Ukraine are considered to be controlled if their value, determined in accordance with the accounting rules, exceeds UAH 10 million (net of indirect taxes) for the corresponding tax (reporting) year.
For all cases listed above, the value criteria for recognition of transactions as controlled should be calculated at prices that are in line with the arm’s-length principle.
Some transactions are considered to be at arm’s-length (i.e. transactions in which prices are subject to state regulation, transactions subject to mandatory valuation, transactions in which prices are determined by mandatory auction, transactions on forced sale of collateral) if the conditions of transactions meet the respective legislation requirements.
### Transfer pricing methods
The Tax Code of Ukraine provides five methods for determining the arm's-length nature of controlled transactions:
According to the Tax Code, the selected transfer pricing method should be the one that the taxpayer reasonably considers as being most appropriate according to the facts and circumstances of the controlled transaction unless the Tax Code specifies the requirements for the application of a specific method of justification of the arm’s-length nature of the controlled transactions of a certain type.
The most appropriate method of transfer pricing is selected taking into account the following criteria:
The taxpayer, taking into account these criteria, uses any method that the taxpayer deems most appropriate; however, if there is a possibility to apply both the CUP and any other method, the CUP method is used.
Where, subject to such criteria, the resale price method or the cost plus method and the net profit or profit split method can be applied by the taxpayer with equal reliability, the resale price method or the cost plus method shall be used.
For controlled transactions on transfer of functions from one counterparty to another where it is not possible to apply one of the methods prescribed above, the special methodology is prescribed.
The CUP method is a priority for controlled commodity transactions. The list of commodities is defined and published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. When applying the CUP method for these transactions, the taxpayer may compare the prices within the controlled transactions with the prices of comparable uncontrolled transactions (actually performed by the taxpayer or other unrelated parties) and/or with commodity quotations. The State Tax Service of Ukraine publishes a recommended (non-exclusive) list of data sources for obtaining commodity quotations on its official web portal before the beginning of the reporting year.
If the taxpayer decides to apply methods other than CUP for commodities transactions, the taxpayer should include in its transfer pricing documentation (Local File):
The Tax Code also provides the possibility for the use of several transfer pricing methods (or a combination thereof) to substantiate the arm's-length nature of controlled transactions. However, the taxpayer may not use more than one method to determine whether the nature of a controlled transaction is at arm’s-length. The application of methods that are not prescribed by the Tax Code (*see above*) is prohibited.
For the purposes of applying transfer pricing methods, the following information may be used:
### Transfer pricing documentation/reporting
All taxpayers performing controlled transactions in the reporting year should file a report on controlled transactions (transfer pricing notification) by 1 October of the year following the reporting year.
All taxpayers belonging to an international group of companies and performing controlled transactions in the reporting year should file a notification on participation in an international group of companies (CbCR Notification) by 1 October of the year following the reporting year.
Starting from 23 May 2020, three-tier transfer pricing documentation is introduced in Ukraine, which includes the following:
The taxpayer submits the CbCR to the tax authorities within 12 months after the last day of the financial year, which is defined by the parent company of the international group of companies (within 12 months after the end of the calendar year in the absence of information on the financial year defined by the parent company of the international group of companies).
Note that the first reporting period for submitting the CbCR is:
As of 4 December 2023, for Ukraine the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports has not yet entered into force with any foreign jurisdiction. Consequently, for the rest of taxpayers, the first reporting period for submitting the CbCR has not yet been established.
The first reporting period for submitting the CbCR is:
Transfer pricing documentation and global transfer pricing documentation (Master File) should be prepared in Ukrainian only in any format (either a single document or a set of documents).
The Tax Code of Ukraine contains a detailed list of information to be included in transfer pricing documentation (Local File), global transfer pricing documentation (Master File), CbCR, and notification on participation in an international group of companies.
### Business purpose
Starting from 23 May 2020, the requirements for the content of transfer pricing documentation (Local File) were extended. The most important changes are that the taxpayer should include in the Local File a justification of the business purpose (economic benefits resulting from the controlled transactions compared to realistically available alternatives between unrelated parties) for controlled transactions on the purchase (sale) of goods, works (services), intangible assets (including licenses), and items of business transactions other than goods. If the taxpayer fails to justify the business purpose/economic benefit within the controlled transactions, there is a risk that the Ukrainian tax authorities will not recognise such controlled transactions when calculating the taxpayer’s financial result or the controlled transactions may be replaced by an alternative option between unrelated parties acting commercially in comparable conditions.
From 1 January 2022, the concept of 'business purpose' is also applied to the uncontrolled transactions with non-residents from 'low-tax' jurisdictions or of special organisational and legal forms, which are included in the list of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, as well as royalty charges with all non-residents.
### Transfer pricing adjustments
If the prices/profitability of the controlled transaction do not correspond with the arm's-length principle, the taxpayer should perform the respective transfer pricing adjustment and pay additional tax. The parties to the controlled transaction are entitled to perform a proportional transfer pricing adjustment. The proportional adjustment for Ukrainian taxpayers is allowed if the counterparty is a related party to the taxpayer and has made an actual adjustment of its tax liabilities. In addition, there should be an effective DTT between Ukraine and the jurisdiction of the non-resident related party.
Starting from 1 January 2021, the amount of controlled transactions that does not correspond with the arm's-length principle (range) will be determined as deemed dividends paid to the non-resident. Additional exposure of 15% WHT (unless a lower rate is provided by the DTT), as well as advance CIT payment, may be applicable in such a case.
The interquartile range of benchmark prices/price level index (PLI) is considered to be a yardstick used for substantiation of the arm’s-length nature of the transactions. The taxpayers should adjust the financial result/prices of the transactions to the levels corresponding with the lower/higher quartiles, while the adjustments, assessed by the tax authorities, are made to the median of the interquartile range. The adjustments are made based on the results of the reporting (tax) year.
### Transfer pricing audit
The Tax Code also provides for a specialised transfer pricing audit as the tax authorities are not allowed to examine pricing in controlled transactions during normal full-scope tax audits. The audit duration cannot exceed 18 months, although extension is possible for another 12 months. Such a period is also suspended until the completion of court proceedings on claims by the taxpayer regarding issues related to the assignment, conduct or subject of such audit.
The tax authorities cannot conduct more than one transfer pricing audit within one calendar year, although other (non-transfer pricing) tax audits can be conducted during this period. The statutory limitation period for transfer pricing assessments is seven years.
The tax authorities have the right to use the information obtained in the course of transfer pricing audit from the taxpayers who were parties to the tested controlled transactions or were involved in supply chain with regard to the subject of controlled transactions. In case of failure to provide information, the tax authorities have the right to cross-audit such taxpayers.
With the introduction of martial law on 24 February 2022, transfer pricing audits were not initiated, and the initiated audits were suspended.
However, starting from 25 November 2022, the following unscheduled transfer pricing audits were resumed for the period until martial law is terminated or cancelled in Ukraine (1):
Notes
Responsibility under the Tax Code (including the responsibility for ongoing violations committed before 25 November 2022) applies for taxpayers starting from 25 November 2022 as a result of the above audits for any non-compliance identified. In this case, the moratorium on financial penalties/fines for the duration of martial law, the state of emergency, and/or quarantine does not apply.
In addition, the deadline for submission of transfer pricing documentation (Local File) and global transfer pricing documentation (Master File) requested by the tax authorities, as well as the report on controlled transactions, notification on participation in an international group of companies, and CbCR has been reinstated until martial law is terminated or cancelled in Ukraine.
If the parties to the controlled transaction do not provide sufficient justification for the actual actions of the parties to the transaction and the actual conditions of its conduct, then the functions, risks, and assets are distributed in favour of the party to the controlled transaction who is a resident of Ukraine.
### Penalties in transfer pricing
The Tax Code defines penalties for non-compliance with the following transfer pricing rules:
Payment of such penalties does not exempt the taxpayer from the obligation to file the transfer pricing documents prescribed above.
### Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)
Large taxpayers have the right to enter into APAs with the tax authorities in order to agree on certain terms of controlled transactions in advance. For a large taxpayer, it is also possible to pre-align pricing in controlled transactions that are or will be carried out by those large taxpayers.
For the period from May 2024 through December 2024, there were no significant changes in the Tax Code regarding transfer pricing rules (except for the above-mentioned changes with respect to the reporting period for submitting the CbCR and upcoming changes regarding the criteria for recognising transactions as controlled).
## Thin capitalisation
Starting from 1 January 2021, the following rules apply to legal entities whose debts to all non-residents (not only related parties) exceed equity by 3.5 times:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC rules in Ukraine will come into force on 1 January 2022. The first reporting period is 2022. The first report is allowed to be submitted in 2024 for the first two reporting periods.
Penalties are not applied for violation of the requirements of the Tax Code of Ukraine during the determination and calculation of the profit of the CFC based on the results of the 2022-2023 reporting years.
According to the results of the 2022-2023 reporting (tax) years, the taxpayer and officials shall not be subject to administrative and criminal liability for any violations related to the application of the norms of the Tax Code of Ukraine regarding reporting on CFCs.
On 1 July 2024, Law No. 3706-IX that introduces to the Tax Code of Ukraine amendments with regard to liability for violations of the rules of reporting on CFC will enter into force. According to the Law No. 3706-IX, during the period of martial law in Ukraine, and six months after the month in which the martial law is suspended or cancelled, the taxpayer will not be subject to penalties and administrative and criminal liability for violations related to the application of the CFC rules, namely for non-submission or untimely submission of the CFC report and notification on the acquisition or alienation of a share in a foreign legal entity, or of the initiation/termination of actual control over a foreign legal entity, and for non-display by the controlling person in the CFC report of information on the available CFCs.
Broadly, under the CFC regime, a Ukraine resident company or individual may be taxed on a proportion of the profits of certain entities that are owned or controlled by a Ukrainian tax resident. The profits of a CFC are included into the taxable income of the controlling person and are taxed at standard income tax rate and rules. Please note there are a few specific tax rates for individuals.
### Definition of a CFC
An entity is deemed to be a CFC if it is:
Foreign establishments without the status of a legal entity (e.g. partnerships, trusts, funds, foundations) are also equated to an entity for CFC purposes.
A controlling person of a foreign company is defined as:
Control may be established directly or through a chain of indirect ownership.
### Available CFC exemptions
Profits of CFCs should be exempt from taxation under the CFC rules in Ukraine under the following conditions:
### Determining taxable profits
A CFC's taxable profits are calculated as net profits before tax as per its unconsolidated financial statements for a relevant calendar year, prepared under domestic GAAP or IFRS adjusted per specific list of tax adjustments. The Tax Code does not provide for a mandatory audit of financial statements; however, the tax authorities may request an audit report if they have doubts.
Losses incurred by a CFC may be carried forward and decrease taxable profits of this CFC in the future. Loss from revaluation of securities is non-deductible; only loss from trading operations can be deducted.
Foreign taxes paid on the profits of a CFC, either under Ukrainian law or the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, may be offset against the Ukrainian PIT liabilities charged on the CFC’s profits (i.e. only for individuals).
### Implications for affected entities
If none of the available exemptions may be applied, the CFC’s chargeable profits must be apportioned among the relevant Ukrainian controlling persons in proportion to their interest(s) in the CFC as at the final day of the reporting period. Such persons should be taxed on their portion(s) at the applicable rate of income tax. However, the Ukrainian CFC rules have no implications for the CFC itself.
## Treatment of inter-company items
Ukrainian tax legislation provides the following treatment for inter-company items:

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Domestic branches or other separate units are not treated as separate taxpayers for CIT purposes.
In Ukraine, it is not currently possible to register a branch of a foreign legal entity. A foreign company may set up a representative office in Ukraine, which is similar to an unincorporated branch. A non-resident company conducting business activities via a representative office is deemed to carry out business in Ukraine through a PE and may be subject to CIT at the standard rate.
When a foreign company conducts business in Ukraine through a PE, the taxable income should be determined on the same basis as for domestic entities. The non-residents having a PE in Ukraine must register with the Ukrainian tax authorities and pay CIT to the budget.
Distributions made by a PE (from after-tax income) to its head office should not trigger any further taxation in Ukraine, provided that the head office is in a jurisdiction that has an effective DTT with Ukraine. However, certain DTTs with Ukraine provide for the so-called ‘branch tax’ on such distributions, similar to WHT on dividend income.
PEs of non-residents are subject to transfer pricing rules.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Temporarily, up to 1 January 2035, there is a CIT exemption for the income received by investors with significant investments. The taxpayer can use this regime during five consistent years after receiving the status of investors with significant investments. The amount of the potential tax benefit is limited and correlated with the investment made.
The government has provided industrial parks with a number of tax incentives, namely with regard to the payment of income tax (will not be paid for ten years), VAT, import duty, etc. Industrial parks will be able to apply such tax benefits only if they direct tax-exempt funds to the development of the industrial park.
## Simplified (unified) tax system
Entities and individuals (i.e. private entrepreneurs) are entitled to use a simplified (unified) tax system (with exemption from CIT) if certain requirements are met.
Groups 1 and 2 of the simplified (unified) tax system are available for private entrepreneurs only, and group 3 for both private entrepreneurs and legal entities (depending on the types of activities, the level of income [only up to 1,167 minimal salary as of 1 January of the reporting year (for 2024 this amount is equal to UAH 8,285,000), except agricultural producers], and the number of employees’ criteria).
These regimes foresee low effective tax rates (up to 10% of the amount of statutory subsistence minimum for able-bodied individuals as of 1 January of the reporting year for group 1 per month; up to 20% of the minimal salary set as of 1 January of the reporting year for group 2 per month, or up to 5% of revenue for a private entrepreneur/an entity of the third group) and easier reporting for small businesses. However, specific types of business activities are prohibited under this tax regime (*inter alia*, transactions with certain excisable products, exploration/production/sale of precious metals and stones, company management and communication services).
Taxpayers of group 1 are not required to use cash registers. Taxpayers of group 2, 3, and 4 are obligated to start using cash registers in the quarter following the one when their revenue exceeds 220 minimal salary as of 1 January of the reporting year (2024 this amount is equal to UAH 1,562,000). Taxpayers engaged in selling technically complex household goods subject to warranty services, medicines, and healthcare products are obligated to use cash registers regardless of the revenue amount they earn.
Starting from 1 October 2020, the list of taxpayers required to use cash registers regardless of the revenue amount they earn was extended, in particular to taxpayers engaged in: e-commerce; hoteling; selling jewellery and household goods made from precious metal and gems; retail of used goods via shops; restaurant business; providing travel agency and tour operator services; and selling of textiles, spare parts, and accessories for motor vehicles.
Starting from 1 January 2022, all taxpayers of group 2, 3, and 4, regardless of their revenue, are required to use cash registers.
The group 4 classification of the simplified (unified) tax system is available for qualified agricultural producers.
Agricultural producers are entitled to use a very favourable tax regime (with exemption from CIT), provided certain requirements are met. The main criterion requires that income from the sale of their own agricultural products constitutes not less than 75% of their total gross revenue of the previous tax (reporting) year.
Under this system, the amount of tax due depends on the size of the agricultural land plot owned or rented by the agricultural producers. The tax rates vary from 0.19% to 6.33%, apply to the normative monetary value of one hectare of agricultural land, and depend on the type of such land.
## Foreign tax credit
Tax residents are allowed to credit foreign taxes paid on income received abroad, provided there is a DTT between Ukraine and the relevant foreign jurisdiction. The amount of foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of Ukrainian tax payable in the respective reporting period. To claim a tax credit, the taxpayer requires an official confirmation of income received, tax base, and amount of income tax paid in such a foreign jurisdiction. Such documents are issued by the relevant foreign tax authority and should be properly legalised and translated into Ukrainian.

# Ukraine
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Exchange controls
### General legal framework
On 24 February 2022, a martial law legal regime was declared in Ukraine. In order to ensure stability of the financial system, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), by its Board Resolution No 18, dated 24 February 2022, introduced a number of restrictions and limitations for financial transactions. The NBU updates the Resolution on a regular basis.
### Key limitations to currency transactions
### Remittance/movement of funds across the Ukrainian border by individuals
Generally, settlements abroad using Ukrainian credit/debit cards are limited to a certain extent. For instance, individuals may transfer funds abroad within the limit of UAH 100,000 (or its equivalent) per month for online purchases (for cards both in UAH). Online purchases from the account in foreign currencies are not limited.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers to a foreign banking card are allowed for cards in foreign currency only and are limited to the equivalent of UAH 100,000 per month.
Also, cash withdrawal from bank accounts in Ukraine is limited to UAH 100,000 per day (or its equivalent for withdrawal from bank accounts in foreign currency).
Cash withdrawals from Ukrainian credit/debit cards abroad are limited to UAH 12,500 per week (7 calendar days) for accounts in UAH and in the amount of UAH 100,000 per day for accounts in foreign currency.
There is also no limit for remittance of funds by post or physical cash movement across the Ukrainian border. However, they are subject to the following requirements:
### Remittance of funds across the Ukrainian border by business entities
As mentioned above, payments abroad (e.g. payments as a result of a charter capital decrease, investing) are prohibited, except (*inter alia*):
It is also possible to return the loans (and interest) provided by non-residents loans granted by non-residents:
Payment of the interest under the loans provided before 20 June 2023 (and without the participation of an international financial organisation, etc) is also possibly subject to a number of requirements (interest accrued starting from 1 May 2024 may be returned without limitations and overdue interest accrued for the period from 24 February 2022 till 1 May 2024 may be repaid within the EUR 1 million limit).
## Choice of business entity
Generally, a limited liability company (LLC) is one of the most widely used vehicles for legal presence in Ukraine for both residents and non-residents. An LLC has a reasonably straightforward registration procedure and is generally easy to maintain during the company’s lifecycle. There is no statutory fee for the LLC’s registration. Activities of LLCs in Ukraine are mainly governed by the Law On Limited and Additional Liability Companies and other relevant legislation.
Another type of legal presence that foreign investors tend to choose is a representative office (RO) of a foreign company in Ukraine. The choice between the RO and the LLC depends on the nature of the planned business activities, regulatory framework and need to obtain any licenses/permits, plans regarding further development of business in Ukraine, taxation issues, and other factors. The RO does not have a status of a separate legal entity (it is rather a structural division of the parent company).
In certain cases, it might be relevant to establish a joint stock company (JSC). At the same time, in case of JSCs, various establishment and operational considerations should be taken into account. As opposed to LLCs and/or ROs, setting-up and operating a JSC is usually significantly more arduous and time-consuming.
## Business and tax treatment of intellectual property (IP)
Ukraine ratified major international treaties in the IP field, including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, Patent Cooperation Treaty, Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organization. In 2014, Ukraine also ratified the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, which means that Ukraine must ensure an adequate level of effective protection and enforcement of IP rights.
The key legal aspects of IP protection in Ukraine to consider are as follows:
The new Law on Copyright and Related Rights No. 2811-IX came into force on 1 January 2023 and provides for the protection of digital assets. In particular, legal protection is provided to objects generated by artificial intelligence (AI) for 25 years. The protection of databases depends on their specifics: (i) original databases are protected by copyright for the life of the author and 70 years thereafter (as a rule), and (ii) non-original databases are protected by sui generis right for 15 years.
Tax treatment for IP transactions is subject to separate analysis on a case-by-case basis since the Ukrainian tax legislation provides different approaches depending on the nature of the concluded agreement. For instance, the transfer of IP may be treated as a sale of intangible assets, the provision of services, or a royalty agreement.
For tax purposes, the term ‘royalty’ does not include payments for the use of computer programs by the end user or for purchasing electronic copies of IP for final consumption.
## Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) from a business and tax perspective
There are no specific laws regulating public takeovers or mergers in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Tax Code provides some guidance on the tax regime for corporate mergers and acquisitions. CIT consequences of such transactions will depend on their accounting in accordance with the financial accounting rules. Some special rules apply to the transfer of the tax attributes within business restructurings.
In view of the martial law enacted in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Private Entrepreneurs, and Public Organizations of Ukraine (as well as other public registers) functions with certain limitations.
## Legal regime of the temporarily occupied territories
As of now, Crimea and certain territories of Donetsk and Lugansk region are considered as temporarily occupied territories.
New territories that are *de facto* occupied by the Russian Federation as a result of escalation of Russian Federation military invasion may be declared as Temporarily Occupied Territories pursuant to the procedure established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Currently, newly Temporarily Occupied Territories are established as such by the List of the territories on which hostilities are (were) conducted or temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation, approved by the Order of the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine No 309 dated 22 December 2022.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) rules compliance
The United States and Ukraine have reached an agreement in substance with regard to implementing the US FATCA under a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), and Ukraine has consented to disclose this status. On 29 October 2019, Ukraine’s Parliament ratified the IGA.
Under the IGA between Ukraine and the United States, Ukrainian financial institutions are required to annually report, by 1 September of the year following the reporting year, to the State Tax Service of Ukraine information about financial accounts held in Ukraine by US taxpayers or foreign entities in which US taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest. This information will be further transferred to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Please note that due to the war in Ukraine, the deadline for 2021 reporting year has been postponed to 2023.
On 28 April 2023, Law of Ukraine No. 2970-IX came into force, which is intended to introduce into Ukrainian legislation the requirements of the OECD Common Reporting Standard, which is a prerequisite for Ukraine's accession to the international system of information exchange under the Multilateral Agreement of Competent Authorities on the Automatic Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts (CRS Multilateral Agreement).
Under CRS procedure, Ukrainian financial institutions will report to the Ukrainian State Tax Service (the supervisory authority) information on accounts of non-resident individuals and legal entities (including private funds, trusts, partnerships, and accounts of legal entities indirectly owned by individuals), which, in turn, will transmit the information to the tax authorities of the respective foreign countries.
The Law of Ukraine No. 2970-IX imposes the following basic requirements on Ukrainian financial institutions:
Account holders, on the other hand, are required to:
It is expected that the automatic exchange of relevant information with other countries will take place as early as 2024.
As of 30 September 2024, the State Tax Service of Ukraine successfully carried out the first mutual international automatic exchange of CRS information.
As a result of the CRS information exchange, the State Tax Service of Ukraine:
On 19 August 2024, Ukraine expressed its intent to sign a Multilateral Convention to Facilitate the Implementation of the Pillar Two Subject-to-Tax Rule (Subject-to-Tax Rule, STTR MLI). The STTR is part of a package of rules aimed at ensuring a minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprises. However, no provisions into local legislation were introduced in this respect.

An official confirmation, issued by the relevant foreign tax authority and legalised/stamped with Apostille, is compulsory for claiming a foreign tax credit in Ukraine.
The amount of foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of Ukrainian tax that would arise from the same income in Ukraine (i.e. at 18%). Credit against military tax is not allowed.

# Ukraine
## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Note that Ukrainian legislation is constantly undergoing changes and developments; consequently, taxpayers should seek expert advice wherever possible.
## Main legislation changes
The major tax reform in Ukraine was implemented in January 2016. The main changes related to individuals and effective from 2017-2021 are the following:
## 2020 tax legislation updates
In 2020, the Ukrainian government passed a law amending the tax legislation of Ukraine. Below we provide the list of main changes/clarifications in respect of taxation of individuals:
- 9% if the individual actually receives the allocated funds (directly or through the chain of indirect ownership) and such distribution took place before the submission of the CFC report.
- 18% in other cases. Recalculation of the tax (from 18% to 9%) and refund of part of the paid tax is possible provided that the individual actually receives the allocated funds and submits an adjusting annual tax return before the end of the second calendar year following the reporting year.
## 2021 tax legislation valid since 1 January 2022
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
The following exemptions for PIT and military tax for income paid by a Ukrainian donator have been introduced:
Income provided as funds or goods (including additional benefits) to a taxpayer (and family members of first relationship degree) are not included into their total taxable income for 2022 and 2023 year, and following years until 31 December of the year when martial law will be cancelled, if:
Receipt of such non-taxable funds or goods (including additional benefits) do not require filing of the annual tax declaration by itself. If a taxpayer received other income that requires filing a tax declaration, then such receipt of funds or goods should be included in the tax return as non-taxable income.
## Military tax
A temporary 1.5% military tax on personal income was introduced in August 2014. This will be effective until the reformation of the Ukrainian Military Forces is completed and affects all taxable income of residents and non-residents in Ukraine. The tax base is not capped. Ukrainian employers and other tax agents are responsible for tax withholding.
Military tax from income not received from a tax agent should be paid on a self-assessment basis within the deadlines for PIT. It cannot be relieved using a double tax treaty (DTT).
In accordance with Law 4015-IX, which came into force on 1 December 2024, the military tax rate has been increased or introduced for new categories of taxpayers and is the following:
1. For individuals: Increased from 1.5% to 5%; the tax base is the same as the PIT base.
2. Introduced for private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime: 10% of a monthly amount of minimum salary set as of 1 January of the reporting year (UAH 7,100 for 2024 year, UAH 8,000 for 2025 year) applies on a monthly basis.
3. Introduced for taxpayers registered on the third group of the simplified regime: 1% from the gross taxable income (i.e. revenue).
4. For individuals on military service and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Security Service of Ukraine, Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine, Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, National Guard of Ukraine, State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, and State Special Transport: 1.5% from the PIT base.
Starting from the 1 January of the year following the year when martial law will be cancelled, the military tax rate for individuals will be 1.5%.
Private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime pay military tax not later than the 20th day (inclusive) of the current month. The controlling authority calculates the advance payments. Advance payment of military tax could be done for the whole tax (reporting) period (quarter, year) but not more than by the end of the current reporting year.
Taxpayers who are registered on the third group of the simplified regime pay military tax within ten days after the deadline for filing a tax declaration for the reporting quarter.
Payers of the military tax listed in points (ii) and (iii) above declare military tax in their tax return of a payer of single tax. The penalties that apply to the violation of military tax payment for private entrepreneurs are the same as for violations of unified tax payment for a respective group.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Personal deductions
A registered resident taxpayer may claim a so-called ’tax deduction’ from the annual taxable income for a limited amount of documented expenses paid to Ukrainian institutions in the reporting year for the expenses described below.
The total deduction may not exceed the amount of taxable income received in the form of salary (in practice, salary received from Ukrainian tax agents). Amounts not deducted from the income of the reporting year cannot be carried forward. All expenses should be properly documented.
### Charitable contributions
Donations to registered Ukrainian charities and not-for-profit organisations are deductible in an amount that is not higher than 4% of the taxpayer's taxable income.
### Education expenses
Education expenses include the pre-school, extracurricular, school, secondary professional, or higher education of a taxpayer and his/her family members (i.e. spouse, parents, children) or guardians and fiduciaries, including parents-educators, in Ukrainian institutions. The total amount of the tax deduction charged to the taxpayer in the reporting tax year may not exceed the amount of the annual general taxable income of the taxpayer calculated as a salary.
### Insurance premiums
Limited premiums for voluntary long-term life insurance or non-state pension insurance for the benefit of a taxpayer and their immediate family members (i.e. spouse, parents, children) are deductible. For 2024, the deductible amount is limited to UAH 4,240 per month for a taxpayer. Limit for the payment related to the taxpayer's immediate family members is half of the above monthly limit.
### Mortgage interest expenses
A limited amount of interest on a qualified mortgage is deductible, provided it is used to finance the acquisition of a taxpayer’s ’main place of residence’ (i.e. the apartment/house where the taxpayer is registered).
## Business deductions
Private entrepreneurs registered under the general tax regime may deduct business expenses and depreciation charges, subject to the rules established by the Tax Code.

## Pension duty
Pension duty is payable by individuals upon purchase of passenger cars prior to the first registration of the vehicle in Ukraine. The tax base is the value of the vehicle. For 2023, depending on the value of the vehicle, the following rates apply (based on the minimum subsistence level; the subsistence minimum for 2024 and 2025 is UAH 3,028):
Pension duty is also payable by individuals who acquire real estate (with the exception of Ukrainians who acquire residential premises for the first time) at 1% of the asset's value.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Employment income
All income received from employment in monetary form or in kind during a calendar year is subject to PIT. This includes all basic pay, overtime pay, supplemental pay, awards and bonuses, compensation for unused vacation, all other monetary amounts, and additional benefits granted by employers to employees.
Taxable income of foreign nationals who are residents of Ukraine is determined in the same order as for Ukrainians.
## Income from disposal of property
Proceeds from the sale of real estate (a house, a flat, or a share of such a house/flat/cottage, or an unfinished construction of such asset) is exempt from taxation if it is the first disposal for the year and the asset was in the individual’s possession for more than three years (the latter condition does not apply to sales of inherited property). A 5% rate (for tax residents) and 18% rate (for tax non-residents) apply to subsequent sales of immovable property during the calendar year. Commercial property does not qualify for the aforementioned exemption. The tax must be paid before notarisation of the sale-purchase agreement. *See 2021 tax legislation valid since 1 January 2022 in the [Significant developments](significant-developments.html) section for recent amendments*.
Proceeds from sales of movable property are generally taxed at 5%. One sale per calendar year of a car, a motorcycle, or a scooter is exempt from taxation. A 5% rate applies to the second sale of such assets during a calendar year for tax residents, an 18% rate applies to the third and subsequent sales during the same calendar year. An 18% rate applies to incomes from the disposal of movable property received by tax non-residents.
Note that the tax authorities may disagree with the applicability of the above-mentioned exemptions to tax non-residents.
In addition, the 5% military tax applies to such income if it was taxed with PIT.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from a Ukrainian legal entity CIT payer (other than a collective investment arrangement) are subject to PIT at a 5% rate. Dividends paid by non-residents, mutual investment funds, and non-payers of CIT in Ukraine are taxed at 9%, as well as distribution of profits, including accumulated profits from previous periods, from foreign formations without the status of a legal entity (starting from 2022).
Dividends that are 'not ordinary' are taxed at 18% PIT.
In addition, the 5% military tax applies to such income (as well as any other income taxable with PIT).
## Interest income
Bank interest, as well as most other passive income, is subject to 18% PIT starting from 1 January 2016. In addition, the 5% military tax applies to such income.
Banks and credit unions are required to withhold PIT and report to the tax authorities the total amount of interest income and tax withheld during a given period without providing any information on the individuals or their bank accounts.
## Exempt income
Generally, all income received or accrued for the taxpayer (or paid to third parties for the benefit of the individual) in any form is taxable, with some minor exceptions:
The USC made by an employer per Ukrainian tax legislation is not included in the taxable income of the individual. Contributions made to foreign pensions and/or social security funds are considered as an individual's additional taxable income.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Residents are individuals who have their place of abode in Ukraine. When an individual has a place of abode in another country as well, such an individual is deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they have a permanent place of abode (domicile) in Ukraine.
If the individual has a domicile in another country as well, they are deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they have a centre of vital interests in Ukraine. A sufficient, but not exclusive, ground for determining the country of an individual’s centre of vital interest is the place of permanent abode of the individual’s family members.
In the event that the individual’s centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if the individual has no domicile in any country, they are deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they stay in Ukraine at least 183 days during the tax year (calendar year).
If residency status cannot be determined based on the above rules, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident of Ukraine if they are a citizen of Ukraine.
Registered freelancers and private entrepreneurs also qualify as Ukrainian tax residents and are subject to Ukrainian tax on their worldwide income.
Non-residents are individuals who do not qualify as residents of Ukraine.
