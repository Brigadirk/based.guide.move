# Hong Kong SAR
## Overview
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is located in Eastern Asia on the southeast coast of Chinese mainland. The official languages of Hong Kong SAR are Chinese and English, and the currency is the Hong Kong dollar (HKD). Hong Kong SAR continues to link its currency closely to the United States dollar (USD), maintaining an arrangement established in 1983.
Hong Kong was a self-governing British colony from 1841 to mid-1997. Pursuant to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong became a SAR of the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. According to the Basic Law (Hong Kong SAR's constitutional document), Hong Kong SAR is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defence affairs for the next 50 years after the sovereignty transfer under the 'one country, two systems' policy. The Basic Law ensures that Hong Kong SAR's legal system is separate from the one of Chinese mainland and remains within the common law system. The Hong Kong SAR Government is committed to upholding the rule of law, which has played a vital role in Hong Kong SAR's success in the past.
Hong Kong SAR is one of the freest economies in the world. Hong Kong SAR became a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in 1991 and a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 1 January 1995.
Over the past few decades, Hong Kong SAR has been transformed from a labour-intensive manufacturing-based economy towards a high value-added and knowledge-based economy, with focus on international trade, financial services, tourism, etc. Since the handover in 1997, Hong Kong SAR has become increasingly integrated with Chinese mainland through trade, tourism, and financial links. Hong Kong SAR has also established itself as the premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad and a prime renminbi (CNY) offshore centre.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
Inventory may be stated at the lower of cost or market value. Last in first out (LIFO) may not be used for tax purposes. First in first out (FIFO) must be consistently applied.
The prevailing accounting standards provide three ways to account for financial instruments, namely at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income, and at fair value through profit or loss, which for profits tax purposes is regarded as the ‘fair value basis’. Following the court decision in the *Nice Cheer* case, the increases (unrealised gains) in the market values of trading securities are not taxable while the decreases (unrealised losses) may be deductible if they represent a provision for diminution in value that is material and likely to be permanent. For years of assessment for which the basis period begins on or after 1 January 2018, taxpayers may make a generally irrevocable election to adopt the above-mentioned fair value basis to account for their financial instruments for tax purposes, subject to certain conditions and with certain exceptions. Whether the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account or other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible will continue to be subject to the source rules and the nature (i.e. capital vs revenue) of the amounts.
There are special tax provisions for valuation upon cessation of a business under which inventory is valued at market value, unless it is sold to a person carrying on business in Hong Kong SAR, who may deduct a corresponding amount as the cost of the inventory in computing the assessable profits.
There are also special tax provisions for valuation when (i) there is a change of intention for holding something as trading stock to capital asset or vice versa, or (ii) trading stock of a trade has been acquired or disposed of otherwise than in the course of the trade. In such circumstances, valuation based on the market value will apply.
## Capital gains
Gains from realisation of capital assets or receipts that are capital in nature are generally not taxed. However, offshore disposal gains derived from the sale of assets may be deemed to be sourced from Hong Kong SAR and regarded as not arising from the sale of capital assets even if they so arise and are taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (*see Foreign income below*).
As a means to provide upfront certainty to taxpayers, the IRO was amended to implement the Enhancement Scheme under which onshore equity disposal gains that satisfy all the prescribed conditions, including, inter alia, that the investor entity has held at least 15% of the equity interests in the investee entity throughout a continuous period of 24 months immediately prior to the date of disposal of such interests, will be regarded as capital in nature and not chargeable to profits tax. Nonetheless, the Enhancement Scheme does not apply to (i) gains derived by an insurance company and (ii) gains on equity interests that are regarded as trading stock or non-listed equity interests in certain property-related entities.
The Enhancement Scheme applies to eligible onshore disposal gains that are in relation to any disposal occurring on or after 1 January 2024 and that accrues in or after the year of assessment 2023/24.
## Dividend income
Dividends from local companies chargeable to tax are exempt, whereas dividends from overseas companies are generally offshore in nature and not subject to Hong Kong profits tax. However, offshore dividend income may be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (*see Foreign income below*).
## Interest income
Hong Kong sourced interest income received by or accrued to a corporation carrying on a trade or business in Hong Kong SAR is subject to profits tax. Exemption is provided to interest income derived from any deposit placed in Hong Kong SAR with a financial institution, unless the deposit secures a borrowing where the interest expense is deductible. This exemption, however, does not apply to interest accruing to a financial institution. Offshore interest income may be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (*see Foreign income below*).
Interest accruing to a bank or financial institution will be deemed to be sourced and taxable in Hong Kong SAR if the interest arises through or from the carrying on of business in Hong Kong SAR by the bank or financial institution.
Interest income arising through or from the carrying on of an intra-group financing business in Hong Kong SAR by a corporation (other than a financial institution) will be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR.
## Royalties
Offshore royalty income may be deemed to be sourced from and taxable in Hong Kong SAR under the refined FSIE regime (*see Foreign income below*).
Royalties received by or accrued to a non-resident for the use of or right to use in Hong Kong SAR or outside Hong Kong SAR (if the royalties are deductible in ascertaining the assessable profits of a person for Hong Kong profits tax purposes) a trademark, patent, design, copyright material, layout-design of an integrated circuit, performer’s right, plant variety right, secret process or formula, or other property of a similar nature, or for the exhibition or use in Hong Kong SAR of cinematograph or television film or tape, any sound recording, or any advertising material connected with such film, tape, or recording, are deemed to be taxable in Hong Kong SAR. A total of 30% of the sum received or accrued is deemed to constitute profits subject to tax in normal situations. Where such royalties are received by or accrued to an associate, however, 100% of the sum is deemed to constitute profits under certain circumstances.
## Partnership income
Partnership business is taxed as a single entity, although each partner can use its share of losses incurred by a partnership to offset against the assessable profits of its other business. In general, there is no special registration requirement other than business registration for a partnership. The assessable profits of a partnership are basically determined in the same way as those of a corporation, with certain special rules (e.g. salaries or other remunerations paid to a partner or a partner’s spouse are not deductible).
## Unrealised exchange gains/losses
Unrealised exchange gains/losses arising from financial instruments that are revenue in nature and with a Hong Kong source are taxable/deductible if they are recognised in the profit and loss account in accordance with a specified financial reporting standard (which means the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard [HKFRS] 9, the International Financial Reporting Standard 9 [Financial Instruments], or equivalent) and an election has been made by the taxpayer to adopt a fair value basis for profits tax filing purposes.
For other cases, taxpayers may exclude any unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses in the tax computation and bring them back for assessment/deduction when they become realised in subsequent years, provided that such realisation basis is adopted consistently for profits tax filing purposes.
The nature and source of exchange gains/losses are determined by the nature and source of the underlying transactions. Exchange gains/losses arising from ordinary business transactions (e.g. trade receivables or payables) are taxable/deductible whereas exchange gains/losses arising from capital transactions (e.g. sale of capital assets) are non-taxable/non-deductible.
## Foreign income
Hong Kong resident corporations are not taxed on their worldwide income. Foreign-sourced income is generally not taxed. However, under the refined FSIE regime, effective from 1 January 2023, four types of offshore income, namely (i) interest, (ii) dividends, (iii) equity interest disposal gains, and (iv) IP income (collectively, ‘specified foreign-sourced income’), are deemed to be sourced from Hong Kong SAR and chargeable to profits tax if the income is received in Hong Kong SAR by an MNE entity carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR (irrespective of its revenue or asset size) and the recipient entity fails to meet a relevant exception from the deeming provision. With effect from 1 January 2024, the scope of ‘specified foreign-sourced income’ is expanded to include disposal gains on other types of assets (in addition to equity interests). The exceptions from the deeming provisions are:
There is no controlled foreign company (CFC) legislation.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Resident consignees are required to furnish quarterly returns to the HKIRD showing the gross proceeds from sales on behalf of their non-resident consignors and to pay to the CIR a sum equal to 0.5% of such proceeds. The HKIRD normally accepts this as satisfying the Hong Kong tax obligations of the non-resident.
Hong Kong SAR has so far entered into 51 treaties with different jurisdictions. The following table shows the applicable WHT rates for payments made from Hong Kong payers to non-treaty and treaty jurisdiction corporate recipients. The rates shown in the table are the lower of the domestic and treaty rates. For WHT rates on payments received by Hong Kong recipients from treaty jurisdiction payers, please refer to the summaries of the respective treaty jurisdictions. All of the following treaties have been ratified and are effective unless indicated otherwise in the notes below.

Notes
1. Hong Kong SAR does not impose WHT on dividends and interest currently. However, the treaties provide for a maximum WHT rate on dividends and interest should Hong Kong SAR impose such WHT in the future. Some of the treaties also provide for a reduced WHT rate on dividends and interest if conditions specified in the treaties are met.
2. With the introduction of two-tiered profits tax rates, there are two possible sets of domestic WHT rates on royalties paid to non-resident corporations:
1. If the two-tiered tax rates apply, the WHT rates are 2.475% for the first HKD 6.67 million of gross royalty income (i.e. the deemed profit rate of 30% times the tax rate of 8.25% for the first HKD 2 million of assessable profits) and 4.95% for the remaining amount of gross royalty income (i.e. the deemed profit rate of 30% times the tax rate of 16.5% for the remaining amount of assessable profits).
2. If the two-tiered tax rates do not apply, the WHT rate for the whole amount of gross royalty income is 4.95%.
The 2.475% and 4.95% rates are determined by applying the relevant two-tiered tax rates, which are 8.25% and 16.5%, respectively, on the deemed assessable profits of the royalties. In the normal situation, the deemed assessable profits are 30% of the royalties received by or accrued to a non-resident corporation. Hence, the effective WHT rate on the royalties ranges from 2.475% (when the deemed assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the deemed assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable).
In the situation where a person carrying on a trade or business in Hong Kong SAR has, at any time, wholly or partly owned the IP in respect of which the royalties are paid and the non-resident corporation is an associate of the Hong Kong payer, the deemed assessable profits are 100% of the royalties received by or accrued to a non-resident corporation. Hence, the applicable WHT rates are 8.25% for the first HKD 2 million of assessable profits and 16.5% for the remaining amount if the two-tiered tax rates are applicable.
4. The domestic WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable), capped at 3% according to the treaty.
5. For payments for the use of, or the right to use, aircraft, the effective WHT rate ranges from 2.475% on the gross payments (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 3% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable). For other cases, the effective WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable).
6. Since a rate specified in the treaty is higher than the domestic WHT rates, the effective WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable).
7. The domestic WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable), capped at 4% according to the treaty.
8. The 0% rate applies to payments for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience. For other cases, the WHT rate on the gross royalty income ranges from 2.475% (when the assessable profits are HKD 2 million or less and the two-tiered tax rates are applicable) to 4.95% (in relation to the assessable profits in excess of HKD 2 million when the two-tiered tax rates are applicable or when the two-tiered tax rates are not applicable), capped at 3% according to the treaty.
9. The treaty is pending ratification.
10. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2025/26 in Hong Kong SAR.
11. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2024/25 in Hong Kong SAR.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Payroll taxes
### Contribution to mandatory provident fund (MPF) scheme
Hong Kong SAR’s MPF system came into operation on 1 December 2000. The MPF scheme is designed to provide a formal, compulsory system of retirement protection by way of a privately managed contribution scheme. An employee is required to contribute 5% of their monthly income, and the employer must make a monthly contribution matching this amount. The maximum level of income for contribution purposes is HKD 30,000 per month. Accordingly, the maximum mandatory contribution for each of the employee and employer is HKD 1,500 per month. The employee’s mandatory contributions will be withheld from the monthly income by the employer.
An employee whose income is less than HKD 7,100 per month is not required to make mandatory contributions. However, the employer of such employee is required to contribute an amount that is equal to 5% of the employee’s monthly income.
Exemption from joining the MPF scheme is available for some very limited categories of employees, including people from overseas who enter Hong Kong SAR for employment for not more than 13 months or who are covered by an overseas retirement scheme.
An employee or an employer may make voluntary contributions in addition to the mandatory contributions required.
## Profits tax
Business profits with a Hong Kong source derived by individuals are taxable under profits tax irrespective of whether they are residents. While there is no capital gains tax in Hong Kong SAR, onshore gains from disposal of assets may be considered as trading gains which are taxable under profits tax. Hong Kong sourced royalties received by resident individuals are taxable as business profits under profits tax. Withholding tax is applicable to royalties received by non-resident individuals if the use of the relevant intellectual property (IP) is in Hong Kong SAR or the use is outside Hong Kong SAR and the royalties paid can be claimed as deductible under profits tax by the payer.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT) / Goods and services tax / Sales tax
Value-added, goods and services, and sales taxes do not apply in Hong Kong SAR.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Hong Kong SAR.
## Estate and gift taxes
Hong Kong SAR does not have an estate duty or a gift tax.
## Property tax
Property tax is charged to the owner of any land or buildings (except government and consular properties) in Hong Kong SAR at the standard rate of 15% on the net assessable value of such land or buildings. Net assessable value of a property is the consideration payable to the owner for the right to use the land or buildings less irrecoverable rent, rates paid by the owner, and a 20% notional allowance. Property occupied by the owner for self-use is not subject to property tax as no rent is receivable with respect to that property.
## Government rates and rent
Rates are an indirect tax levied on properties in Hong Kong SAR. Rates are charged at 5% of the rateable value which is the estimated annual rental value of a property at the designated valuation reference date of 1 October. For domestic tenements, rates are charged on the rateable value at progressive rates of 5% (for the first HKD 550,000), 8% (for the next HKD 250,000), and 12% (for the remainder).
Privately owned land in Hong Kong SAR is normally held by way of a government lease under which rent is payable to the Hong Kong SAR government in return for the right to hold and occupy the land for the term (i.e. the duration) specified in the lease document. Currently, government rent is calculated at 3% of the rateable value of the property and is adjusted in step with any subsequent changes in the rateable value.
## Treatment of foreign owned real estate
Offshore rental income or gain from disposal of foreign real estate owned by a Hong Kong resident individual is generally not subject to Hong Kong tax.
## Customs duties
Hong Kong SAR does not impose customs duties on imported goods. Excise tax is levied on limited categories of dutiable commodities (i.e. tobacco, liquor, methyl alcohol, and hydrocarbons) regardless of whether they are imported or locally manufactured. As far as individuals are concerned, the duties are usually included in the sale prices of such commodities by the retailers.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is charged on transfer of Hong Kong stock by way of sale and purchase at 0.2% of the consideration (or the market value if it is higher) per transaction. Hong Kong stock is defined as stock the transfer of which must be registered in Hong Kong SAR.
Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, ad valorem stamp duty on transfer of properties is charged at progressive rates ranging from HKD 100 (for property consideration of up to HKD 3 million) to 4.25% (for property consideration exceeding HKD 20 million).
The stamp duty payable is computed by applying the relevant rate to the consideration or market value of the property (whichever is higher). Marginal relief is available for transfer where the consideration is marginally above the lower bound of each rate band.
For lease of immovable property in Hong Kong SAR, stamp duty is calculated at a specified rate of the annual rental that varies with the term of the lease. Currently, the applicable rate ranges from 0.25% (for lease period of not more than one year) to 1% (for lease period of more than three years).
## Special stamp duty (SSD)
There is an SSD on resale of residential property in Hong Kong SAR within 24 months from the date of acquisition. Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of SSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Buyer’s stamp duty (BSD)
A BSD is payable on acquisition of Hong Kong residential properties by any person other than a Hong Kong permanent resident.  Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of BSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Transfer tax / Turnover tax / Registration tax
There is no transfer/turnover tax in Hong Kong SAR.
### Motor vehicle first registration tax (FRT)
All motor vehicles to be used on roads in Hong Kong SAR, whether brand new or used, are subject to the FRT. In general, the taxable value is calculated on the basis of the published retail price or provisional taxable value assessed by the Customs and Excise Department. The applicable tax rate depends on the class of the motor vehicle. To encourage the use of environment-friendly commercial vehicles with lower emissions, concession of the FRT is offered to first registered owners of environment-friendly commercial vehicles meeting the qualifying standards of the tax incentive scheme.
## Environmental taxes
### Plastic shopping bag (PSB) charging scheme
### Municipal solid waste (MSW) charging
The Hong Kong SAR government announced on 27 May 2024 that it will defer the implementation of MSW charging until further notice.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong SAR adopts a territorial basis of taxation. Profits tax is payable by every person (defined to include corporation, partnership, and sole proprietorship) carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR on profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR from that trade, profession, or business. In general, the tax residence of a person is irrelevant, and there is no distinction between residents and non-residents when it comes to liability to profits tax, except in a tax treaty context. Non-residents carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR are chargeable to tax on profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR unless they are from jurisdictions with which Hong Kong SAR has a tax treaty and are protected by the treaty.
Gains and receipts that are capital in nature are generally not subject to tax. Dividends from local companies chargeable to tax are exempt, whereas dividends from overseas companies are generally offshore in nature and not subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR. However, offshore disposal gains derived from the sale of assets and offshore dividends may be deemed taxable under the refined foreign-sourced income exemption (FSIE) regime, *as elaborated below*. The tax treatments of public and private companies are the same.
Certain income that would not otherwise be subject to Hong Kong profits tax is deemed to arise in or be derived from Hong Kong SAR from a trade, profession, or business carried on in Hong Kong SAR and thus becomes taxable in Hong Kong SAR. This includes royalties received by a non-resident for the use of or right to use a patent, design, trademark, copyright material, layout-design of an integrated circuit, performer’s right, plant variety right, secret process or formula, or other property of a similar nature in Hong Kong SAR, or for the use of or right to use such intellectual property (IP) outside Hong Kong SAR, but the royalties paid can be claimed as a deduction by a person for Hong Kong profits tax purposes.
Effective from 1 January 2023, under the refined FSIE regime, four types of offshore income, namely (i) interest, (ii) dividends, (iii) disposal gains from the sale of equity interests (equity interest disposal gains), and (iv) IP income (collectively, ‘specified foreign-sourced income’), are deemed to be sourced from Hong Kong SAR and chargeable to profits tax if the income is received in Hong Kong SAR by a multinational enterprise (MNE) entity carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR (irrespective of its revenue or asset size) and the recipient entity fails to meet a relevant exception from the deeming provision. With effect from 1 January 2024, the scope of ‘specified foreign-sourced income’ is expanded to include disposal gains on other types of assets (in addition to equity interests). The exceptions from the deeming provision are:
Effective from the year of assessment 2018/19, there is a two-tiered profits tax rates regime in Hong Kong SAR. The following table shows the applicable tax rates for corporations and unincorporated businesses:
| Rates of tax | **Where the two-tiered rates apply** \* (%) | **Where the two-tiered rates do not apply**  (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corporations: |  |  |
| First HKD 2 million | 8.25 | 16.50 |
| On the remainder | 16.50 |
| Unincorporated businesses: |  |  |
| First HKD 2 million | 7.50 | 15.00 |
| On the remainder | 15.00 |
\* As an anti-avoidance measure, a ‘group of connected entities’ can only nominate one entity within the group to enjoy the two-tiered tax rates for a given year of assessment.
There are special rules for determining the tax liabilities of certain industries, such as shipping, air services, and financial services. There is also a special tax framework for Islamic bonds (i.e. *sukuk*) that provides for the same tax treatments for *sukuk* vis-à-vis their conventional counterparts.
Incomes from certain qualifying debt instruments (QDIs) issued before 1 April 2018 are either tax exempt or subject to a concessionary tax rate (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate) depending on the date of issue and maturity period of the QDIs. Incomes from QDIs issued on or after 1 April 2018 are tax exempt regardless of the maturity period, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. However, there is a specific anti-avoidance provision under which the concessionary tax rate / tax exemption does not apply to incomes derived from QDIs by a person who is an associate of the issuer of the QDIs.
Publicly offered funds that are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong SAR and other similar *bona fide* widely held investment schemes that comply with the requirements of a supervisory authority within an acceptable regulatory regime are exempt from Hong Kong profits tax. Effective from 1 April 2019, both onshore and offshore privately offered funds are exempt from Hong Kong profits tax on profits derived from certain specified transactions provided that the specified transactions are carried out or arranged by ‘specified persons’ (i.e. SFC licensed fund managers) or the funds are a ‘qualified investment fund’ as defined. There are also specific anti-avoidance provisions in the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO) deeming certain resident persons to be subject to profits tax on their share of the non-resident person’s tax-exempt profits.
Profits derived from the business of reinsurance of onshore and offshore risks and qualifying onshore and offshore captive insurance business are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate). Profits derived from (i) general reinsurance business of direct insurers, (ii) certain types of general insurance business of direct insurers, and (iii) certain types of insurance brokerage business of licensed insurance brokers are also subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of regular profits tax rate) effective from 19 March 2021.
Qualifying profits derived by a qualifying corporate treasury centre are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate) under specified conditions.
Qualifying profits derived from qualifying aircraft leasing activities and qualifying aircraft leasing management activities carried out in Hong Kong SAR are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 8.25% (i.e. 50% of the regular profits tax rate) under specified conditions.
Effective from 1 April 2019, qualifying profits derived from qualifying ship leasing activities carried out in Hong Kong SAR are subject to profits tax at concessionary tax rate of 0% whereas qualifying profits derived from qualifying ship leasing management activities carried out in Hong Kong SAR are subject to profits tax at concessionary tax rate of 0% (for activities carried out for associated corporations) or 8.25% (for activities carried out for non-associated corporations), subject to specified conditions.
Effective from 1 April 2022, qualifying profits derived from qualifying shipping-related activities, namely ship agency, ship management, or ship broking activities, carried out in Hong Kong SAR are eligible for tax exemption or a concessionary profits tax rate of 0% or 8.25%, subject to specified conditions.
Carried interest received by or accrued to a qualifying recipient on or after 1 April 2020 from the provision of investment management services in Hong Kong SAR for a certified investment fund may be eligible for a concessionary profits tax rate of 0%, subject to specified conditions.
Effective from the year of assessment 2023/24, qualifying income from certain IP is eligible for a concessionary tax rate of 5% under the patent box regime. The ‘nexus approach’ endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 5 Report will apply to determine the extent of eligible IP income that can qualify for the preferential tax treatment.
For an eligible family-owned investment holding vehicle (FIHV) managed by an eligible single-family office (ESF Office) in Hong Kong SAR, its assessable profits earned from qualifying transactions and incidental transactions (the latter being subject to a 5% threshold) on or after 1 April 2022 are subject to profits tax at a concessionary tax rate of 0% under specified conditions.
The concessionary tax treatments under the following special tax regimes will be available only if the taxpayer has substantial activities in Hong Kong SAR in terms of the number of qualified employees and amount of operating expenditure, which must be adequate in the opinion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) and, in any event, not lower than the minimum thresholds as set out further below:
For the concessionary tax regimes on ship leasing and certain shipping-related activities, the minimum threshold requirements during the basis period for a year of assessment are as follows:

# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong SAR does not impose income tax based on an individual’s total income. Instead, the three main types of income derived by individuals are taxed under different income taxes. That is, business or trading profits are taxed under profits tax, income from employment, office, or pension is taxed under salaries tax, and rental income from immovable property is taxed under property tax. The residence status of an individual is not a determinative factor in examining one's liability to salaries tax except in a tax treaty context.
## Territorial basis of taxation
A person’s residence, domicile or citizenship is not relevant in determining liability to Hong Kong salaries tax under the domestic law. The term ‘resident’ is defined in each of the comprehensive double tax agreements (CDTAs) signed by Hong Kong SAR and is used in applying a CDTA.
Hong Kong SAR adopts a territorial basis of taxation. All individuals, whether a resident or non-resident of Hong Kong SAR, are subject to Hong Kong salaries tax on (i) Hong Kong-sourced employment income, (ii) income from an office held in Hong Kong SAR, and (iii) income from a Hong Kong pension.
## Employment income
A person has Hong Kong-sourced employment income if the employment is a Hong Kong employment or in case the employment is a non-Hong Kong employment, the employment services are rendered by the person in Hong Kong SAR.
The Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (HKIRD) will generally accept that an employment is a non-Hong Kong employment if all of the following three conditions are met:
If any of the above conditions is not met, the employment will likely be considered by the HKIRD as Hong Kong employment.
For a Hong Kong employment, employment income is not taxable if all of the employment services for a year of assessment are rendered outside Hong Kong SAR. In determining whether all the services are rendered outside Hong Kong SAR for a given year of assessment, no account is taken of services rendered in Hong Kong SAR during visits not exceeding 60 days in the basis period for the year of assessment (the so-called ‘60-day rule’).
For a non-Hong Kong employment, only income attributed to services rendered in Hong Kong SAR is subject to Hong Kong salaries tax (the so-called ‘time apportionment basis’). Similar to Hong Kong employment, the 60-day rule will apply in considering whether there are any services rendered in Hong Kong SAR in a given year of assessment under a non-Hong Kong employment (i.e. services rendered in Hong Kong SAR during visits not exceeding 60 days in the basis period for the year of assessment will be ignored).
Where the employment income of an individual is subject to tax both in Hong Kong SAR and an overseas jurisdiction that does not have a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR, a unilateral income exemption may be available under the domestic tax law to provide relief from double taxation (*see the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](hong-kong-sar/individual/foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for more information*).
There are special rules for taxing employment income derived by seafarers and aircrew.
Carried interest received by or accrued to a qualifying employee on or after 1 April 2020 from an employment with a qualifying entity that provides investment management services to a certified investment fund in Hong Kong SAR can be wholly excluded from employment income for salaries tax purposes, subject to specified conditions.
## Income from an office
The source of income from an office (e.g. directors’ fees) is determined by the location at which the company paying the fees is centrally managed and controlled. The ‘60-day rule’ and ‘time apportionment basis’ discussed above do not apply to income from an office.
## Pensions
Pensions are, in practice, subject to Hong Kong salaries tax if the funds out of which the payment is made are managed and controlled in Hong Kong SAR, and the pensions (other than a government pension) are related to services rendered in Hong Kong SAR. Similar to income from an office, the ‘60-day rule’ and ‘time-apportionment basis’ discussed above do not apply to income from a pension.
## Personal income tax (salaries tax) rates
In general, a person’s income from employment, less allowable deductions and personal allowances, is chargeable to Hong Kong salaries tax at progressive rates ranging from 2% to 17% as follows:
For 2024/25:
| Net taxable income (HKD) | | Tax on column 1 (HKD) | Percentage on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 50,000 | - | 2 |
| 50,000 | 100,000 | 1,000 | 6 |
| 100,000 | 150,000 | 4,000 | 10 |
| 150,000 | 200,000 | 9,000 | 14 |
| 200,000 |  | 16,000 | 17 |
The maximum tax for 2024/25, however, will be limited to tax at the two-tiered standard rates (15% on the first HKD 5 million of net income and 16% on the remainder) on the net assessable income after any allowable deductions (see the *[Deductions](hong-kong-sar/individual/deductions.html) section*) but without the deduction of personal allowances.
In rare cases where the total amount of allowable deductions exceeds the assessable income of an individual taxpayer in any year of assessment, the excess can be carried forward indefinitely to set off against the taxpayer’s assessable income in subsequent years of assessment.
## Local income taxes
Hong Kong SAR does not impose any local, state, or provincial income taxes.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Taxable period
An assessment year (or tax year) begins on 1 April of a year and ends on 31 March of the following year.
## Basis of assessment
The basis of assessment is the total assessable income accrued to a person in a given year of assessment with appropriate adjustments for allowable deductions and personal allowances.
## Personal assessment
An individual who is a Hong Kong resident may elect for personal assessment whereby income chargeable to salaries tax, profits tax and property tax is aggregated in a single assessment. Personal assessment enables an individual to offset a business loss against income subject to salaries tax or property tax and to claim deduction of loan interest on rental properties which is not available under property tax. Losses brought forward from previous tax years under personal assessment may be used to offset against income in current year or subsequent years. Allowable deductions and appropriate personal allowances are granted under personal assessment and the tax is calculated on the balance in the same manner as for salaries tax. The maximum tax payable is, however, limited to tax at the standard tax rate on the person's total assessable income less allowable deductions, but without a deduction for personal allowances.
A married person may elect for personal assessment on one's own rather than jointly with one's spouse as far as one is an individual who (i) is of or above the age of 18 years or is under that age if both parents are deceased and (ii) is either ordinarily resident in Hong Kong SAR or a temporary resident of Hong Kong SAR.
However, if a married couple has elected for joint assessment for salaries tax purposes, then an election for personal assessment must be made jointly by both individuals of the married couple.
## Joint assessment for married couples
Although the two individuals of a married couple who both earn taxable income are normally taxed separately, they may elect to be taxed jointly (i.e. election for joint assessment) where it is beneficial to them.
Under joint assessment, the total income of both spouses will be aggregated under one assessment, with adjustments for allowable deductions and appropriate personal allowances.
## Tax returns
Individual tax returns are issued on the first working day of May each year. The filing deadline is usually within a month from the date of issue. However, individuals who are represented by a tax representative are normally granted an extension of an additional month for filing their returns. Further extensions for return filing may be possible upon application and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
A notice of assessment will be issued after the tax return has been processed by the HKIRD under the ‘assess first, audit later’ approach. Taxpayers may be subject to post-assessment investigation of the HKIRD at a later date.
## Payment of tax
Tax is usually payable in two instalments. The dates of payment of tax, which generally fall in January and April of the year following the year in which the tax return is issued, are determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and specified in an assessment notice. A system of provisional tax payments applies whereby estimated tax payments are made during the current year. The provisional salaries tax payable is normally estimated based on the previous year’s net chargeable income. The provisional salaries tax already paid is credited against the final salaries tax assessed for a year of assessment, which is determined after filing of the return.
## Withholding requirements
An employer is not obliged to withhold salaries tax from the remuneration paid to an employee except in cases where an employee is about to leave Hong Kong SAR for more than one month other than on a normal business trip. In such cases, the employer may be required to withhold payments from the departing employee.
As dividends and interest derived by individuals are not subject to Hong Kong income tax, there is no withholding requirement on such income derived by an individual.
Withholding tax is applicable to royalties received by non-resident individuals for the use of the relevant IP in Hong Kong SAR or for the use outside Hong Kong SAR and the royalties paid can be claimed as deductible under profits tax by the payer.
## Audit cycle
There is no specific tax audit cycle in Hong Kong SAR. Tax investigation targets are selected based on specific facts and circumstances of individual cases and certain criteria (e.g. income level) determined by the HKIRD.
## Statute of limitations
An additional assessment may be made by a HKIRD tax assessor if a taxpayer chargeable to tax has not been assessed to tax or has been assessed at less than the proper amount. The assessment must be made within the relevant year of assessment or within six years after the end of that year of assessment. The time limit for making additional assessments is extended when a taxpayer either has not been assessed, or is under-assessed, due to fraud or wilful evasion. In that case an additional assessment may be made up to ten years after the end of the relevant assessment year.
Salaries tax issues that are often subject to close scrutiny of the tax authority include: time apportionment claim, income exemption claim, taxability of termination payments, taxation of employee share benefits, and taxation of carried interest.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Hong Kong SAR does not have a VAT, goods and services tax, or sales tax.
## Customs duties
There is no tariff on general imports in Hong Kong SAR.
## Excise tax
Duties are levied on limited categories of dutiable commodities (i.e. tobacco, liquor, methyl alcohol, and hydrocarbons), regardless of whether they are imported or locally manufactured.
## Property tax
Property tax is charged annually to the owner of any land or buildings (except government and consular properties) in Hong Kong SAR at the standard rate of 15% on the net assessable value of such land or buildings. Net assessable value of a property is the consideration payable to the owner for the right to use the land or buildings less irrecoverable rent, rates paid by the owner, and a 20% notional allowance.
Rental income derived by a corporation from a Hong Kong property is subject to profits tax. The corporation that is subject to profits tax may apply for an exemption from property tax in respect of the property. If no exemption is applied, the property tax paid can be used to offset against the profits tax payable by the corporation.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is charged on transfer of Hong Kong stock by way of sale and purchase at 0.2% of the consideration (or the market value if it is higher) per transaction. Hong Kong stock is defined as stock the transfer of which must be registered in Hong Kong SAR.
Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, ad valorem stamp duty on transfer of properties is charged at progressive rates ranging from HKD 100 (for property consideration of up to HKD 3 million) to 4.25% (for property consideration exceeding HKD 20 million).
The stamp duty payable is computed by applying the relevant rate to the consideration or market value of the property (whichever is higher). Marginal relief is available for transfer where the consideration is marginally above the lower bound of each rate band.
For lease of immovable property in Hong Kong SAR, stamp duty is calculated at a specified rate of the annual rental that varies with the term of the lease. Currently, the applicable rate ranges from 0.25% (for lease period of not more than one year) to 1% (for lease period of more than three years).
Exemption is available for certain transactions, such as transfer of shares or immovable property between associated bodies corporate, transfer of shares or units of exchange traded funds (ETFs) listed in Hong Kong SAR, transfer of shares by ETF market makers in the course of allotting and redeeming ETF units listed in Hong Kong SAR, transfer of shares relating to dual-counter stock made by dual-counter market markers, certain stock borrowing and lending transactions, and transfer of REIT shares or units and jobbing business of options market markers, provided that the specified conditions for exemption (if any) are satisfied.
## Special stamp duty (SSD)
There is an SSD on resale of residential property within 24 months from the date of acquisition. Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of SSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Buyer’s stamp duty (BSD)
A BSD is payable on acquisition of Hong Kong residential properties by any person (including Hong Kong and foreign companies) other than a Hong Kong permanent resident. Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of BSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Business registration fees
Every person who carries on a business in Hong Kong SAR is required to apply for business registration with a fee within one month from the date of commencement of the business. The business registration certificate has to be renewed either on an annual basis or every three years with a payment of a business registration (renewal) fee. Special registration and licence fees are applicable to banks and deposit-taking companies.
## Capital duty
There is currently no capital duty in Hong Kong SAR.
## Government rates and rent
Rates are an indirect tax levied on properties in Hong Kong SAR. Rates are charged at 5% of the rateable value, which is the estimated annual rental value of a property at the designated valuation reference date of 1 October. For domestic tenements, rates are charged on the rateable value at progressive rates of 5% (for the first HKD 550,000), 8% (for the next HKD 250,000), and 12% (for the remainder).
Privately owned land in Hong Kong SAR is normally held by way of a government lease under which rent is payable to the Hong Kong SAR government in return for the right to hold and occupy the land for the term (i.e. the duration) specified in the lease document. Currently, government rent is calculated at 3% of the rateable value of the property and is adjusted in step with any subsequent changes in the rateable value.
## Hotel accommodation tax
Effective from 1 January 2025, a hotel accommodation tax of 3% is imposed on hotel and guesthouse accommodations. This tax will be levied on the accommodation charges payable by guests to hotel or guesthouse proprietors unless an exemption applies.
## Payroll taxes
In Hong Kong SAR, there are no payroll taxes other than the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) contribution (*see below*).
## Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) contribution
Under the MPF scheme, an employer is required to make a mandatory contribution for an employee in the amount equal to 5% of the monthly income of that employee. The maximum level of income for contribution purposes is HKD 30,000 per month. An employer may make voluntary contributions in addition to the mandatory contribution required.
## Environmental taxes
### Plastic shopping bag (PSB) charging scheme
### Municipal solid waste (MSW) charging
The Hong Kong SAR government announced on 27 May 2024 that it will defer the implementation of MSW charging until further notice.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Taxable period
A year of assessment (or tax year) begins on 1 April of a year and ends on 31 March of the following year. The period that is used to compute the taxable profits for a year of assessment is called the basis period, which is normally the financial year ending in the year of assessment.
## Tax returns
Tax returns are issued on the first working day of April each year. Effective from the year of assessment 2018/19, there are different supplementary forms for profits tax filing purposes, and taxpayers are required to file the supplementary forms that are applicable to them together with the tax return issued.
The filing deadline is usually within a month from the date of issue of the tax return. However, corporations whose financial year ends between 1 December and 31 March and who are represented by a tax representative are normally granted an extension for filing their returns. The exact filing due date depends on the accounting year-end date of the taxpayer.
The basis of assessment is the accounting profits of the financial year ending within the year of assessment, with appropriate adjustments for tax purposes. A tax return is usually filed together with a tax computation showing the tax adjustments to the accounting profits in arriving at the taxable profits or allowable tax losses for a given year of assessment.
A notice of assessment or statement of loss will be issued after the tax return has been processed by the HKIRD, under the ‘assess first, audit later’ approach. Taxpayers may be subject to post-assessment investigation or field audit based on risk areas or under the computerised random selection procedures of the HKIRD at a later date.
## Payment of tax
Tax is usually payable in two instalments. The dates of payment of tax, which generally fall between November of the year in which the return is issued and April of the following year, are determined by the CIR and specified in an assessment notice. A system of provisional tax payments applies whereby estimated tax payments are made during the current year. The provisional profits tax payable is normally estimated based on the previous year’s assessable profits. The provisional profits tax already paid is credited against the final profits tax assessed for a year of assessment, which is determined after filing of the return.
Taking a company with an accounting year end date of 31 December as an example, the final tax payment for the company for a given tax year is usually due in November of the year in which the return is issued, whereas the provisional tax payments (to be paid in two instalments) are usually due in November of the same year and January of the following year.
## Tax audit process
There is no specific tax audit cycle in Hong Kong SAR. Tax audit targets are selected with reference to certain criteria determined by the HKIRD.
## Statute of limitations
An additional assessment may be made by an HKIRD tax assessor if a taxpayer chargeable to tax has not been assessed to tax or has been assessed at less than the proper amount. The assessment must be made within the relevant year of assessment or within six years after the end of that year of assessment. The time limit for making additional assessments is extended when a taxpayer either has not been assessed, or is under-assessed, due to fraud or wilful evasion. In that case, an additional assessment may be made up to ten years after the end of the relevant assessment year.
A statement of loss is not an assessment, and the above six-year time limit does not apply to issue or revision of a statement of loss. A tax loss year remains technically open until the sixth year after the first year in which the taxpayer has an assessable profit after utilising all the tax losses brought forward.
Profits tax issues that are often subject to close scrutiny of the tax authority include offshore claim of profits, capital claims of income, transactions with associated persons, and deductibility of expenses (e.g. interest expenses, share-based payments, intra-group management/service fees).
## General anti-avoidance rules (GAARs)
The IRO includes a GAAR (i.e. section 61A) allowing the HKIRD to disregard a transaction or counteract the tax benefit conferred by a transaction if the sole or dominant purpose of entering into such a transaction is to obtain a tax benefit. Whether the sole or dominant purpose of entering into a transaction is for obtaining a tax benefit will be assessed according to a set of factors stipulated in section 61A. Another GAAR in the IRO is section 61, which empowers the HKIRD to disregard a transaction that reduces or would reduce the amount of tax payable by any person if that transaction is considered artificial or fictitious. Although both GAARs could be used, in practice, section 61A is more often invoked by the HKIRD in tackling tax avoidance schemes.

## Payroll taxes
### Contribution to mandatory provident fund (MPF) scheme
Hong Kong SAR’s MPF system came into operation on 1 December 2000. The MPF scheme is designed to provide a formal, compulsory system of retirement protection by way of a privately managed contribution scheme. An employee is required to contribute 5% of their monthly income, and the employer must make a monthly contribution matching this amount. The maximum level of income for contribution purposes is HKD 30,000 per month. Accordingly, the maximum mandatory contribution for each of the employee and employer is HKD 1,500 per month. The employee’s mandatory contributions will be withheld from the monthly income by the employer.
An employee whose income is less than HKD 7,100 per month is not required to make mandatory contributions. However, the employer of such employee is required to contribute an amount that is equal to 5% of the employee’s monthly income.
Exemption from joining the MPF scheme is available for some very limited categories of employees, including people from overseas who enter Hong Kong SAR for employment for not more than 13 months or who are covered by an overseas retirement scheme.
An employee or an employer may make voluntary contributions in addition to the mandatory contributions required.
## Profits tax
Business profits with a Hong Kong source derived by individuals are taxable under profits tax irrespective of whether they are residents. While there is no capital gains tax in Hong Kong SAR, onshore gains from disposal of assets may be considered as trading gains which are taxable under profits tax. Hong Kong sourced royalties received by resident individuals are taxable as business profits under profits tax. Withholding tax is applicable to royalties received by non-resident individuals if the use of the relevant intellectual property (IP) is in Hong Kong SAR or the use is outside Hong Kong SAR and the royalties paid can be claimed as deductible under profits tax by the payer.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT) / Goods and services tax / Sales tax
Value-added, goods and services, and sales taxes do not apply in Hong Kong SAR.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Hong Kong SAR.
## Estate and gift taxes
Hong Kong SAR does not have an estate duty or a gift tax.
## Property tax
Property tax is charged to the owner of any land or buildings (except government and consular properties) in Hong Kong SAR at the standard rate of 15% on the net assessable value of such land or buildings. Net assessable value of a property is the consideration payable to the owner for the right to use the land or buildings less irrecoverable rent, rates paid by the owner, and a 20% notional allowance. Property occupied by the owner for self-use is not subject to property tax as no rent is receivable with respect to that property.
## Government rates and rent
Rates are an indirect tax levied on properties in Hong Kong SAR. Rates are charged at 5% of the rateable value which is the estimated annual rental value of a property at the designated valuation reference date of 1 October. For domestic tenements, rates are charged on the rateable value at progressive rates of 5% (for the first HKD 550,000), 8% (for the next HKD 250,000), and 12% (for the remainder).
Privately owned land in Hong Kong SAR is normally held by way of a government lease under which rent is payable to the Hong Kong SAR government in return for the right to hold and occupy the land for the term (i.e. the duration) specified in the lease document. Currently, government rent is calculated at 3% of the rateable value of the property and is adjusted in step with any subsequent changes in the rateable value.
## Treatment of foreign owned real estate
Offshore rental income or gain from disposal of foreign real estate owned by a Hong Kong resident individual is generally not subject to Hong Kong tax.
## Customs duties
Hong Kong SAR does not impose customs duties on imported goods. Excise tax is levied on limited categories of dutiable commodities (i.e. tobacco, liquor, methyl alcohol, and hydrocarbons) regardless of whether they are imported or locally manufactured. As far as individuals are concerned, the duties are usually included in the sale prices of such commodities by the retailers.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is charged on transfer of Hong Kong stock by way of sale and purchase at 0.2% of the consideration (or the market value if it is higher) per transaction. Hong Kong stock is defined as stock the transfer of which must be registered in Hong Kong SAR.
Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, ad valorem stamp duty on transfer of properties is charged at progressive rates ranging from HKD 100 (for property consideration of up to HKD 3 million) to 4.25% (for property consideration exceeding HKD 20 million).
The stamp duty payable is computed by applying the relevant rate to the consideration or market value of the property (whichever is higher). Marginal relief is available for transfer where the consideration is marginally above the lower bound of each rate band.
For lease of immovable property in Hong Kong SAR, stamp duty is calculated at a specified rate of the annual rental that varies with the term of the lease. Currently, the applicable rate ranges from 0.25% (for lease period of not more than one year) to 1% (for lease period of more than three years).
## Special stamp duty (SSD)
There is an SSD on resale of residential property in Hong Kong SAR within 24 months from the date of acquisition. Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of SSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Buyer’s stamp duty (BSD)
A BSD is payable on acquisition of Hong Kong residential properties by any person other than a Hong Kong permanent resident.  Effective from 11 am on 28 February 2024, the rate of BSD payable is reduced to 0%.
## Transfer tax / Turnover tax / Registration tax
There is no transfer/turnover tax in Hong Kong SAR.
### Motor vehicle first registration tax (FRT)
All motor vehicles to be used on roads in Hong Kong SAR, whether brand new or used, are subject to the FRT. In general, the taxable value is calculated on the basis of the published retail price or provisional taxable value assessed by the Customs and Excise Department. The applicable tax rate depends on the class of the motor vehicle. To encourage the use of environment-friendly commercial vehicles with lower emissions, concession of the FRT is offered to first registered owners of environment-friendly commercial vehicles meeting the qualifying standards of the tax incentive scheme.
## Environmental taxes
### Plastic shopping bag (PSB) charging scheme
### Municipal solid waste (MSW) charging
The Hong Kong SAR government announced on 27 May 2024 that it will defer the implementation of MSW charging until further notice.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
For Hong Kong profits tax purposes, corporate residency is not relevant in determining the taxability of an entity except in a tax treaty context. Under the domestic tax law of Hong Kong SAR, the decisive factors for taxability are (i) whether a corporation is carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR, (ii) whether profits are derived from such trade, profession, or business, and (iii) whether profits are arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR.
However, where it is necessary to determine the corporate residence, such as for the purpose of a comprehensive double taxation agreement/arrangement (CDTA), companies incorporated in Hong Kong SAR and companies that are normally managed or controlled / centrally managed and controlled (with a few exceptions and depending on the provisions of the relevant CDTA) in Hong Kong SAR are generally considered as a Hong Kong tax resident.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The decisive factors for determining chargeability to Hong Kong profits tax are whether a person carries on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR and whether Hong Kong-sourced profits are derived from such trade, profession, or business. Whether a trade, profession, or business is carried on in Hong Kong SAR is a question of fact. A non-resident person, including a foreign corporation, having a PE in Hong Kong SAR will be deemed as carrying on a trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong SAR. The profits attributable to the PE will be subject to Hong Kong profits tax if such profits are arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR.
Effective from the year of assessment 2019/20, for a non-Hong Kong resident having a PE in Hong Kong SAR, the TP rules on attribution of profits to a PE in Hong Kong SAR (i.e. TP Rule 2) apply to determine the amount of profits attributed to the PE in Hong Kong SAR (*see the [Branch income](branch-income.html) section for more details on profits attribution to a PE and the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more details on the TP rules*).

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Expenses that are incurred for producing profits chargeable to tax and that are not capital in nature are generally tax deductible. In addition, special tax relief is available for certain capital expenditure. There are special rules for deduction of certain expenses (e.g. interest expenses).
Accounting treatments are usually followed in determining the assessable profits, except when there is an explicit rule in the IRO. Accrued expenses recognised in the profit and loss account in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are usually deductible if they are incurred for producing profits chargeable/subject to Hong Kong profits tax and are not capital in nature.
Expense items for which a tax adjustment is necessary in determining the amount of taxable profits from the accounting profits include: tax depreciation allowance vs. accounting depreciation, expenses that are capital in nature, general provisions that are non-deductible, and non-deductible interest expenses on borrowings used to finance non-income producing assets.
Set out below are the Hong Kong profits tax treatments of some common expense items.
## Tax depreciation of fixed assets
Tax depreciation allowances / deductions are available for capital expenditure incurred on the construction of buildings or structures and in the provision of machinery and plant for trade or business purposes, as follows:
Book depreciation is adjusted for tax purposes in accordance with the above depreciation allowances granted under the IRO.
## Goodwill
Cost of acquisition of goodwill / amortisation of goodwill is not deductible as it is capital in nature.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
In general, company formation/start-up expenses that are incurred before the commencement of a trade, profession, or business and that are for the establishment of the overall income producing structure are capital in nature and not tax deductible.
An R&D tax deduction regime was introduced in Hong Kong SAR that applies to qualifying expenditure incurred or qualifying payment made on or after 1 April 2018. Under the new R&D tax deduction regime, there are two types of qualifying R&D expenditure, namely Type A expenditure and Type B expenditure. Subject to certain conditions, Type A expenditure (R&D expenditure other than Type B expenditure) will be granted a 100% normal deduction. Type B expenditure will be entitled to a 300% deduction for the first HKD 2 million of the expenditure and a 200% deduction for the remaining amount, without any limit on the amount eligible for the 200% deduction.
## Interest expenses
There is no thin capitalisation rule in Hong Kong SAR. However, except in some specified circumstances (e.g. interest expenses paid to an overseas associated corporation by a corporation carrying on an intra-group financing business in Hong Kong SAR where certain conditions are met), interest expenses paid to an overseas recipient other than a financial institution (whether a related or unrelated party) are generally not deductible if the overseas recipient is not subject to Hong Kong profits tax on the interest income. In addition, deduction of interest expense is subject to stringent and complicated rules that are designed to guard against loan arrangements with an intention to avoid Hong Kong profits tax.
## Bad debts
In general, a bad or doubtful debt incurred in any trade, profession, or business, proved to the satisfaction of the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (HKIRD) to have become bad during the basis period for a year of assessment, is deductible. The deduction is limited to debts that were included as a trading receipt in ascertaining the taxpayer’s assessable profits or debts in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of a money-lending business in Hong Kong SAR.
If a taxpayer has elected to adopt the fair value basis to account for its financial instruments for profits tax filing purposes, a special deduction rule instead of the above general rule applies. Under the special rule, an impairment loss recognised in respect of a financial instrument that represents a trading debt or a debt in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of a money lending business in Hong Kong SAR is deductible only if it is credit-impaired.
If any bad debt, doubtful debt, or impairment loss that has previously been allowed as a deduction is ultimately recovered, it will be treated as taxable profits of the basis period in which it is recovered.
## Charitable donations
A deduction is allowed for cash donations to approved charities made in the basis period for a year of assessment if the aggregate of such donations is not less than HKD 100. The deduction is limited to 35% of the assessable profits of the year of assessment.
## Pension expenses
A deduction is allowed for regular/ordinary contributions to a mandatory provident fund scheme or recognised occupational retirement scheme made by an employer in respect of an employee to the extent that the contributions do not exceed 15% of the employee's total emoluments for the period to which the contributions relate.
Special payments, other than the ordinary contributions to a mandatory provident fund scheme or recognised occupational retirement scheme, are capital in nature but can be deducted evenly over a five-year period under a specific provision of the IRO.
There are also specific rules for deduction of provisions for contributions to a mandatory provident fund scheme or recognised occupational retirement scheme.
## Payments for directors
Director fees or other remunerations paid by a corporation to its directors are generally deductible under the normal deduction rule. Nevertheless, no deduction is allowed on salaries or other remunerations paid to a sole proprietor or the proprietor’s spouse, or any partners or partners’ spouses of a partnership business.
## Contingent liabilities
Generally speaking, general provisions for expenses are not deductible, whereas specific provisions are deductible if the HKIRD is satisfied that the amount has been incurred (i.e. the taxpayer has a legal/contractual obligation to pay such amount in the future) and that the provision represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the future liability.
## Special deductions
There are special deduction rules for expenditures incurred:
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not deductible, as the HKIRD does not consider them to be expenses incurred for producing profits chargeable/subject to tax.
## Taxes
Taxes paid on corporate profits are generally not deductible for the purpose of calculating the assessable profits. The HKIRD may consider a foreign tax that is not calculated by reference to profits as deductible under the general deduction provision.
Where foreign taxes were charged on (i) interest income or gains from the sale of a certificate of deposit, bill of exchange, or regulatory capital security that are deemed to be subject to profits tax in Hong Kong SAR or (ii) a certain percentage of gross income without deduction for outgoings and expenses (e.g. WHTs on royalties and service fees), and the same income is also subject to profits tax in Hong Kong SAR, a deduction is allowed for foreign taxes of substantially the same nature of Hong Kong profits tax paid in respect of the same income in the following situations:
## Net operating and capital losses
Net operating losses incurred in an accounting year can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future profits of the business. A corporation carrying on more than one business may have losses in one business offset profits of the others, with any balance being carried forward. However, offshore losses sustained from the sale of assets (where the proceeds are received in Hong Kong SAR, and where the gain would have been taxable had a gain been derived from the transaction) may only be set off against the taxpayer’s assessable profits derived in the current or subsequent years of assessment from specified foreign-sourced income that is chargeable to profits tax under the refined FSIE regime. Net operating losses cannot be carried backward.
Capital losses are not tax deductible.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties and service fees paid/payable by a Hong Kong corporation to foreign affiliates are deductible, provided they are incurred in the production of profits chargeable/subject to tax. There is no special restriction on the deductibility of these payments.
In general, interest payable by a Hong Kong corporation to a foreign affiliate is not deductible if the recipient is not chargeable/subject to Hong Kong profits tax on the interest income received (except where either the payer or the recipient is a financial institution as defined in the tax law). Interest expenses on money borrowed from a non-Hong Kong associated corporation by a corporation in the ordinary course of its intra-group financing business carried on in Hong Kong SAR are deductible, provided that certain specified conditions are met.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong SAR does not have a consolidated or group taxation regime.
## Transfer pricing (TP)
Legislation to implement a TP regulatory regime and TP documentation requirements was enacted in July 2018. The key TP measures and the respective effective dates are as follows:
### The TP regulatory regime
There are two sets of TP rules. Under TP Rule 1, the HKIRD can impose TP adjustments on domestic or cross-border related-party transactions that are not entered into on an arm’s-length basis and that result in a potential Hong Kong tax advantage, with exemptions for certain specified domestic transactions. Under TP Rule 2, the Authorised OECD Approach (i.e. the separate enterprises principle) will be adopted for profit attribution to a PE of a non-Hong Kong resident in Hong Kong SAR (*see the [Branch income](branch-income.html)section for more information*).
TP Rule 1 applies to years of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2018, whereas TP Rule 2 applies to years of assessment beginning on or after 1 April 2019. There is a grandfathering provision under which transactions entered into or effected before 13 July 2018 (i.e. the enactment date of the new TP law) will not be subject to the above TP rules. The HKIRD published Departmental Interpretation and Practice Notes (DIPNs) 59 and 60 in July 2019 to provide further guidance on the interpretation and application of TP Rule 1 and Rule 2, respectively.
In general, the HKIRD will apply the TP rules in the way that is consistent with the OECD’s Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the commentary on the business profits article and associated enterprises article of the OECD Model Tax Convention.
### The TP documentation requirement
There is a mandatory 'three-tiered' TP documentation requirement consisting of Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country (CbC) report.
For Master File and Local File, there are certain exemption thresholds based on the business size and the volume of different types of related-party transactions such that a Hong Kong enterprise is not required to prepare the Master File and the Local File if either the business size thresholds or all the volume-based, related-party transactions thresholds are not exceeded. Master File and Local File are required for accounting periods beginning from 1 April 2018 and have to be prepared within nine months after the accounting period end to which the files relate.
For CbC reports, please see the description of the CbC reporting regime below.
The HKIRD published DIPN 58 in July 2019 to provide further guidance on the three-tiered TP documentation requirements, while DIPN 46 on TP guidelines, which was issued back in 2009, serves as a reference in situations where the new TP Rules 1 and 2 are not applicable.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
Key features of the CbC reporting regime in Hong Kong SAR are summarised as follows:
### The advance pricing arrangement (APA) regime
A statutory APA programme has been introduced since the year of assessment 2018/19. The objectives of the APA programme are to help taxpayers obtain tax certainty on their complex or significant TP arrangements and reduce the risk of double taxation arising from related-party transactions. Any Hong Kong resident enterprise or a non-resident enterprise with a PE in Hong Kong SAR, chargeable to Hong Kong profits tax and having related-party transactions, may apply for an APA, provided that certain conditions (including the threshold for an APA application) are met. Under the statutory APA regime, enterprises can apply for a unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral APA.
Prior to the year of assessment 2018/19, the HKIRD accepted an APA application as part of the advance ruling application. DIPN 48 issued by the HKIRD provides guidance on APAs, such as the timeframe and threshold for an APA application, the various stages involved in the APA process, the interaction between an APA and audit, and possible rollback of the TP methodology agreed under an APA to prior years. The appendices to the DIPN include various sample documents for use in an APA application. DIPN 48 was revised in 2020 to reflect certain updates as a result of the introduction of the statutory APA regime in Hong Kong SAR.
## Thin capitalisation
Hong Kong SAR does not have thin capitalisation rules. *For restrictions on deduction of interest expenses, see Interest expenses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Hong Kong SAR does not have a CFC regime.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
The two-tiered tax rates regime that is applicable to corporations is also applicable to branches of foreign corporations in Hong Kong SAR.
Effective from the year of assessment 2019/20, the Authorised OECD Approach (i.e. the separate enterprises principle) (TP Rule 2) needs to be adopted for attributing income or loss to a PE of a non-Hong Kong resident person (e.g. a branch) in Hong Kong SAR. TP Rule 2 requires the attribution of profits of a non-Hong Kong resident person to its PE in Hong Kong SAR as if the PE were a distinct and separate enterprise, taking into account the functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed by the non-Hong Kong resident person through the PE. After the attribution of profits to the PE, the broad guiding principle (i.e. what has been done to earn the profits in question and where the operations have been performed) would be applied to determine whether the profits are arising in or derived from Hong Kong SAR, hence subject to Hong Kong profits tax.

## Foreign tax credits
For foreign taxes payable/paid by a Hong Kong tax resident on specified foreign-sourced income deemed taxable under the refined FSIE regime, foreign tax credits are available irrespective of whether or not the foreign taxes are paid in a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR. Taxpayers are also required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR.
## Foreign investment incentives
Hong Kong SAR does not have any specific incentives for foreign investment, except that offshore funds may be exempt from profits tax under certain circumstances.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
Hong Kong SAR has enacted domestic tax legislation to implement the following minimum standards under the BEPS Action Plan: (i) introducing a TP regulatory regime and a mandatory three-tiered TP documentation requirement in Hong Kong SAR, (ii) implementing a statutory APA regime in Hong Kong SAR, and (iii) removing the ring-fencing features in certain concessionary tax regimes in Hong Kong SAR.
## Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
Hong Kong SAR, as represented by Chinese mainland, was one of the signatories to the MLI. In implementing the MLI, Hong Kong SAR has taken a pragmatic approach by (i) opting in the provisions of the MLI that represent the BEPS minimum standards (e.g. the principal purpose test for preventing treaty abuse and the requirement for allowing a minimum three-year period for a person to present its case for Mutual Agreement Procedure) and (ii) opting out most of the other provisions that are not mandatory, for instance, those provisions addressing hybrid mismatches and artificial avoidance of PE. The provisions of the MLI will have effect in Hong Kong SAR with respect to a covered tax treaty on 1 April 2023 (for taxes withheld at source) or 1 April 2024 (for other taxes) at the earliest, the exact dates of which are subject to the completion of the legislative and other relevant procedures of the MLI by Hong Kong SAR's tax treaty partners.
## Automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI) / Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime
Under the AEOI/CRS regime in Hong Kong SAR, reportable financial institutions are required to identify the reportable financial accounts held by (i) tax residents of reportable jurisdictions or (ii) passive non-financial entities whose controlling persons are tax residents of reportable jurisdictions in accordance with the specified due diligence procedures, collect the required information of those reportable accounts, and furnish such information to the HKIRD. Such information will be exchanged on an annual basis. Hong Kong SAR will only conduct AEOI with a reportable jurisdiction when an arrangement is in place with the reportable jurisdiction concerned to provide the basis for exchange.
There are 126 reportable jurisdictions effective from 1 January 2020. As of December 2024, Hong Kong SAR has activated exchange relationships for CRS purposes with over 80 jurisdictions based on either a bilateral or multilateral competent authority agreement for CRS.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Currently, Hong Kong SAR has entered into seven TIEAs with different jurisdictions as shown in the following table:
| Denmark | Norway |
| --- | --- |
| Faroes | Sweden |
| Greenland | United States |
| Iceland |  |
All of the above TIEAs are ratified and effective.
In addition to the signing of the Hong Kong SAR-United States TIEA, Hong Kong SAR signed a Model 2 intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in November 2014 to facilitate compliance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) by financial institutions in Hong Kong SAR.
## Foreign investment restrictions
In general, Hong Kong SAR does not impose restriction to foreign investors to make investments in Hong Kong SAR, and wholly foreign owned companies are allowed. The only exception is the restriction on foreign ownership of Hong Kong SAR’s licensed television/sound broadcasters, of which the collective foreign ownership ceiling is 49% of the voting power. In addition, an approval from the Communications Authority must be obtained for holding, acquisition, or exercise of voting control by a foreign investor of more than 5% of a licensee.
## Exchange controls
Hong Kong SAR does not have any foreign exchange control. There is no restriction on entry or repatriation of capital or remittance of profits from investments. Funds can be freely remitted to persons outside Hong Kong SAR by various means (e.g. dividends, interest, royalties, service fees, branch profits).
## Choice of business entity
The principal forms through which a business can be conducted in Hong Kong SAR are as follows:
Of the above, privately incorporated companies and branches of foreign companies are most commonly used by foreign investors, as limited liability is usually desirable.
## Intellectual property (IP) regulations
## Merger and acquisition (M&A) activities
There are no specific restrictions on M&A activities in Hong Kong SAR. The following tax considerations are relevant in the M&A context:

# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Starting from the year of assessment 2018/19, the income exemption claim is only available where foreign tax has been paid in a non-CDTA jurisdiction for services rendered in that jurisdiction.
Technically, this income exemption applies to both Hong Kong and non-Hong Kong employments. However, such exemption is practically not applicable to taxpayers with a non-Hong Kong employment as only income of services rendered in Hong Kong SAR is taxable in cases of non-Hong Kong employment.
A foreign tax credit is available to Hong Kong tax residents in respect of income derived from and taxable in a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR and the same income is subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR. Salaries taxpayers are required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR.
## Tax treaties
Currently, Hong Kong SAR has entered into 51 tax treaties with different jurisdictions as shown in the following table. All of the following treaties have been ratified and are effective unless indicated otherwise in the notes below.
| Armenia (1) | Hungary | The Netherlands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Austria | India | New Zealand |
| Bahrain (1) | Indonesia | Pakistan |
| Bangladesh (2) | Ireland | Portugal |
| Belarus | Italy | Qatar |
| Belgium | Japan | Romania |
| Brunei | Jersey | Russia |
| Cambodia | Korea | Saudi Arabia |
| Canada | Kuwait | Serbia |
| China, the People's Republic of | Latvia | South Africa |
| Croatia (2) | Liechtenstein | Spain |
| Czech Republic | Luxembourg | Switzerland |
| Estonia | Macau SAR | Thailand |
| Finland | Malaysia | Türkiye (1) |
| France | Malta | United Arab Emirates |
| Georgia | Mauritius (3) | United Kingdom |
| Guernsey | Mexico | Vietnam |
Note
1. The treaty is pending ratification.
2. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2025/26 in Hong Kong SAR.
3. The treaty is effective from the year of assessment 2024/25 in Hong Kong SAR.
Hong Kong SAR has not entered into any social security agreements with any jurisdictions as there is no social security tax in Hong Kong SAR.
## Estate and gift tax conventions
Hong Kong SAR has not entered into any estate and gift tax conventions because estate duty was abolished in 2006 and it does not have a gift tax.
## Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs)
Currently, Hong Kong SAR has entered into seven TIEAs with different jurisdictions as shown in the following table.
| Denmark | Norway |
| --- | --- |
| Faroes | Sweden |
| Greenland | United States |
| Iceland |  |
All of the above TIEAs are ratified and effective.
In addition to the signing of the Hong Kong SAR-United States TIEA in March 2014, Hong Kong SAR signed a Model 2 intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in November 2014 to facilitate compliance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) by financial institutions in Hong Kong SAR.
## Automatic exchange of information (AEOI) / Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime
Hong Kong SAR has put in place a legislative framework to implement the AEOI/CRS regime. Reportable financial institutions are required to identify the reportable financial accounts held by (i) tax residents of reportable jurisdictions or (ii) passive non-financial entities whose controlling persons are tax residents of reportable jurisdictions in accordance with the specified due diligence procedures, collect the required information of those reportable accounts, and furnish such information to the HKIRD. Such information will then be exchanged on an annual basis.
There are 126 reportable jurisdictions effective from 1 January 2020. However, Hong Kong SAR will only conduct AEOI with a reportable jurisdiction when an agreement is in place with that reportable jurisdiction to provide the basis for exchange.
As of December 2024, Hong Kong SAR has activated exchange relationships for CRS purposes with over 80 jurisdictions based on either a bilateral or multilateral competent authority agreement for CRS.

# Hong Kong SAR
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Outgoings and expenses other than those of a domestic, private or capital nature are allowable under salaries tax insofar as they are incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the production of income subject to salaries tax. In practice, very few expenses can meet the above restrictive requirements.
## Employment expenses
## Concessionary deductions
A few concessionary deductions are specifically provided for under the Inland Revenue Ordinance.
### Qualifying premiums paid under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS)
Qualifying premiums paid under the Hong Kong SAR government’s VHIS are allowed for deduction starting from the year of assessment 2019/20. The maximum amount to be deducted in respect of qualifying premiums paid for each insured person for each tax year is HKD 8,000, with no cap on the number of insured persons for whom the taxpayer is eligible for claiming the concessionary deductions in a given year of assessment.
### Charitable donations
Charitable donations made in cash to approved charitable institutions are allowable if the aggregated amount for a year of assessment is not less than HKD 100. The deduction for charitable donations is restricted to 35% of the assessable income after allowable deductions of the year of assessment.
### Elderly residential care expenses
### Self-education expenses
A deduction is allowed for self-education expenses paid for employment-related courses. The maximum amount of deduction allowed for each tax year is HKD 100,000.
### Mandatory contributions to an MPF scheme and contributions to other retirement schemes
Mandatory contributions to an MPF scheme and contributions to other recognised occupational retirement schemes are deductible up to a maximum of HKD 18,000 for each tax year.
### **Voluntary contributions to an MPF scheme and qualifying annuity premiums**
Effective from the year of assessment 2019/20, a deduction is allowed for (i) employee’s MPF voluntary contributions made to a designated MPF account and (ii) qualifying annuity premiums paid for a qualifying deferred annuity policy (essentially those policies certified by the Insurance Authority).
The maximum total tax deduction allowed for (i) and (ii) above is HKD 60,000 for each tax year.
If an employee is entitled to tax deduction for both qualifying annuity premiums and MPF voluntary contributions for a year of assessment, deductions will firstly be allowed for MPF voluntary contributions and then for qualifying annuity premiums.
### Domestic rents
Domestic rents paid by a person as a tenant under a qualifying tenancy of domestic premises are allowed for deduction up to a maximum amount of HKD 100,000 (increased to HKD 120,000 for taxpayers residing with a child born on or after 25 October 2023 starting from the year of assessment 2024/25) for each tax year starting from the year of assessment 2022/23.
## Standard deductions
There is no blanket or standard deduction although a few concessionary deductions are available (*see Concessionary deductions above for more information*).
## Personal allowances
Under salaries tax and personal assessment (if elected), allowances are granted to each taxpayer provided that the applicable conditions for the allowances are satisfied. The amounts allowed for the year of assessment 2024/25 are shown below.
| Personal allowances | 2024/25 (HKD) |
| --- | --- |
| Basic allowance (for single persons) (1) | 132,000 |
|  |  |
| Married person’s allowance (for married couples) (1) | 264,000 |
|  |  |
| Child allowances (2): |  |
| 1st to 9th child (each): |  |
| Year of birth | 260,000 |
| Other years | 130,000 |
|  |  |
| Dependent parent or grandparent allowance (each): |  |
| Aged 60 or above: |  |
| Not residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 50,000 |
| Residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 100,000 |
| Aged 55 to 59: |  |
| Not residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 25,000 |
| Residing with taxpayer throughout the tax year | 50,000 |
|  |  |
| Dependent brother or sister allowance (for whom no child allowance is claimed) | 37,500 |
|  |  |
| Single parent allowance (for single parent with sole or predominant care of a child) | 132,000 |
|  |  |
| Disabled dependant allowance (in addition to any allowances already granted for the disabled person) | 75,000 |
|  |  |
| Personal disability allowance (in addition to any allowances already granted for the disabled person) | 75,000 |
Notes
1. If both spouses of a married couple have income chargeable to salaries tax and no joint assessment or joint personal assessment is elected, they are taxed as two single persons and each will be entitled to the basic allowance. The married allowance is given only if one spouse has no income liable to salaries tax and has not elected for personal assessment, or where joint assessment or joint personal assessment is elected by the couple.
2. Child allowances are only available to one of the spouses of a married couple. The couple must state which spouse will claim the child allowance.
## Business deductions
## Losses
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible as they do not meet the conditions of being incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the production of income subject to salaries tax.

## Treatment of business entities
An individual who does not set up a separate legal entity can conduct business in Hong Kong SAR through the following principal forms:
## Visa and work permit
Foreigners are generally required to obtain a work permit before taking employment in Hong Kong SAR.
The Hong Kong Immigration Department will contact the individual and/or the sponsor for verification upon receiving the application.
## Tax equalisation or reimbursement plans
A tax reimbursement programme is usually provided by employers to expatriate employees to alleviate any tax increases which may be incurred as a result of an overseas assignment. A tax reimbursement programme may either be a ‘tax protection’ or ‘tax equalisation’ plan.

## Individual - Sample personal income tax calculation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Below is a sample salaries tax computation for year of assessment 2024/25 for illustrative purposes.
Assumptions:
| Salaries tax computation | HKD | HKD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Salaries | 650,000 |  |
| Bonus | 50,000 |  |
| Total assessable income |  | 700,000 |
| **Less: Concessionary deductions** |  |  |
| Charitable donations | (3,000) |  |
| Retirement scheme contributions | (18,000) | (21,000) |
| Net income |  | 679,000 |
| **Less: Allowances** |  |  |
| Married person’s allowance | (264,000) |  |
| Child allowances (HKD 130,000 x 2) | (260,000) | (524,000) |
| Net chargeable income |  | 155,000 |
| **Tax at progressive rates:** |  |  |
| First HKD 50,000 @ 2% | 1,000 |  |
| Next HKD 50,000 @ 6% | 3,000 |  |
| Next HKD 50,000 @ 10% | 5,000 |  |
| Remainder HKD 5,000 @ 14% | 700 |  |
| **Tax payable (1)** |  | **9,700** |
Note
1. The tax amount calculated based on the standard rate (i.e. HKD 679,000 @15% = HKD 101,850) is higher than that computed at progressive rates so the standard rate would not apply. Tax reduction for the year of assessment 2024/25 (if any) has not yet been announced.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Employment income
Taxable employment income includes any wages, salaries, leave pay, fees, commissions, bonuses, gratuities, perquisites, and allowances, with certain specific exemptions. Set out below are the tax treatments of some common items.
### Benefits in kind
If the employer has sole and primary liability for payment of the benefit, and no other person including the employee acts as a surety in respect of the liability, the employee will generally not be taxed on such benefit, except in three situations:
In the first situation above, the taxable benefit is the second-hand value of the benefit obtained and in the second and third situations the taxable benefit is the cost to the employer of providing the benefit.
### Housing benefits
Housing that is provided or subsidised by an employer or its associated corporation is taxable. However, instead of taxing the amount of rents paid by the employer, the taxable amount is the rental value of the housing quarters in excess of the rents actually paid by the employee for the quarter (if any). The rental value of housing quarters provided by an employer is computed as a percentage of the employee’s assessable income less any allowable outgoings and expenses and depreciation allowances on capital expenditure incurred on machinery or plant, as follows:
| Type of accommodation | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Hotel, hostel, or boarding house, with one bedroom | 4 |
| Hotel, hostel, or boarding house, with not more than two bedrooms | 8 |
| Other accommodation | 10 |
Where an employer refunds all or part of the rents paid by an employee, the treatment will be similar to cases in which the employer provides accommodation to the employee rent-free or at a reduced rent.
A cash allowance for housing is fully taxable where the employer has no control over how it is spent by the employee.
### Retirement benefits
Any sums received by way of commutation of pension under a recognised occupational retirement scheme upon death, incapacity, retirement, terminal illness, or termination of service are exempt, with certain exceptions where there is a termination of service of less than ten years with an employer. Any sums received by way of commutation of pension under the Pensions Ordinance are also exempt.
Any sums received by an employee in connection to the employer's mandatory contributions to an MPF scheme are exempt from salaries tax. Sums related to the employer's voluntary contributions received from an MPF scheme upon death, incapacity, retirement, terminal illness, or termination of service of the employee are also exempt, with certain exceptions where there is a termination of service of less than ten years with an employer. Sums related to the employer's voluntary contributions received at times other than those mentioned above are taxable.
Sums related to employer's contributions received from a retirement scheme that is not a recognised occupational retirement scheme or an MPF scheme are subject to Hong Kong salaries tax.
### Termination payments
Compensation for termination of employment that does not represent a payment for past, present, or future services is not taxable in general. Such payment should be distinguished from termination gratuities that relate to services previously rendered by the employee, which are therefore taxable. Taxable termination payments may be spread backward over the final three years of employment for Hong Kong salaries tax purposes.
Long service or severance payments made in accordance with the Employment Ordinance are not subject to Hong Kong salaries tax.
Payment in lieu of notice is taxable.
## Equity compensation
Gains from any employee share options are taxable when the options are exercised, assigned or released. There are specific provisions governing the taxation of employee stock options. Other employee share-based benefits (such as share awards) are also subject to Hong Kong salaries tax.
## Business income
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends derived by an individual are not subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR.
## Interest income
Interest on bank deposits derived by an individual is not subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR.
## Rental income
## Treatment of intellectual property (IP)
## Exempt income
Certain benefits in kind and retirement benefits received by employees are exempt from salaries tax (*see Benefits in kind and Retirement benefits above for more information*).
## Future rates
No more information is available on future rates.
## Hybrid tax systems
Hong Kong SAR does not have an applicable hybrid system.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
A person’s residence, domicile or citizenship is not relevant in determining liability to Hong Kong salaries tax under the domestic law.
However, where it is necessary to determine an individual's residence, such as for the purpose of a CDTA, individuals who (i) ordinarily reside in Hong Kong SAR or (ii) stay in Hong Kong SAR for more than 180 days during a year of assessment or for more than 300 days in two consecutive years of assessment are generally considered as Hong Kong tax residents.
