# China, People's Republic of
## Overview
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
The People's Republic of China, commonly known as China, is one of the most populous countries in the world, with over 1.3 billion people. Located in East Asia along the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, China is one of the largest countries in the world by land area. The capital of China is Beijing, and the official language is Mandarin Chinese.
The official currency of China is the renminbi (yuan) (CNY), and it is held in a floating exchange-rate system. It used to be managed primarily against the United States dollar (USD). Since 2005, the renminbi has been referenced to a basket of foreign currencies. On 1 October 2016, the renminbi was added into the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket.
For centuries, China stood as a leading civilisation, outpacing the rest of the world in technology, arts, and sciences. After World War II, the Communists, under Mao Zedong, established a socialist system. After 1978, Mao's successor, Deng Xiaoping, and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development, and China began to generate significant and steady growth in investment, consumption, and standards of living.
Since then, China has generally implemented reforms in a gradual fashion. As its role in world trade has steadily grown, its importance to the international economy has also increased apace. China is also the largest trading nation in the world and the largest exporter and second largest importer of goods. China became the world's second largest economy since mid-2010, second only to the United States.
China's growth comes from both huge state investments in infrastructure and heavy industries as well as private sector expansion in light industries.
Exports had been China's major economic driver, but since the 2008 global financial crisis, which seriously affected the international markets of China export products, the Chinese government shifted the focus to stimulate investment and consumption in domestic markets.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions to pension funds, medical funds, etc. are mandatory for Chinese employees. As of 15 October 2011, foreign individuals who hold a China work permit for working in China are required to make social security contributions in relation to pension, medical (including maternity), unemployment, and work-related injury according to the China Social Security Law. Monthly employer and employee social security contribution rates, applicable caps, etc. are governed by local rules, which may vary among the local jurisdictions. For example, contribution rates and caps applicable to local Chinese in Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou are as follows:
| City | Shanghai | | Beijing | | Guangzhou | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|
| Social insurance items | Employee portion | Employer portion | Employee portion | Employer portion | Employee portion | Employer portion |
| Pension | 8% | 16% | 8% | 16% | 8% | 15% |
| Medical (including maternity) | 2% | 9% | 2% | 9.8% | 2% | 5.35% |
| Unemployment | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.2% | 0.8% |
| Work-related injury | 0% | 0.16% to 1.52% | 0% | 0.2% to 1.9% | 0% | 0.2% to 1.4% |
| Total | 10.5% | 25.66% to 27.02% | 10.5% | 26.5% to 28.2% | 10.2% | 21.35% to 22.55% |
| Ceiling for monthly salary base | CNY 36,921 | | CNY 35,283 | | * CNY 27,501 for pension. * CNY 29,979 for medical. * CNY 38,082 for unemployment. | |
Note
The employer is obligated to withhold the applicable social contributions of employees from payroll for onward payment, together with the employer's contributions, to the relevant local authorities on a monthly basis.
China now has totalisation agreements in force with eleven countries. Inbound employees who are citizens or assigned by employers of these countries can be partly exempted from China's social security contributions in accordance with the coverage of the relevant totalisation agreements. Set out below is a list summarising the respective dates of entry into force of the eleven agreements and the social security items exempted under each agreement.
| Country | Date of entry into force | Items of social security exempted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Germany | 4 April 2002 | Pension and Unemployment Insurance |
| Republic of Korea | 16 January 2013 | Pension and Unemployment Insurance |
| Denmark | 14 May 2014 | Pension |
| Canada | 1 January 2017 | Pension |

## Value-added tax (VAT)
An individual engaged in the sale or importation of goods, the provision of services, and the sales of intangible properties and immovable properties is subject to VAT. For general VAT payers, input VAT can be credited against output VAT.
The applicable VAT rates (for general VAT payers) from 1 April 2019 are set out in the following table, and the rate for small-scale VAT payers is 3%.
| Industries | Applicable VAT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Sales or importation of goods | 13 |
| Sales or importation of necessity goods (e.g. agricultural products, water, gas) | 9 |
| Provision of repairs, replacement, and processing services | 13 |
| Tangible movable property leasing services | 13 |
| Transportation services, postal services, basic telecommunications services, construction services, immovable property leasing services, sales of immovable properties, transfer of land-use right | 9 |
| Value-added telecommunications services, financial services, modern services (except for leasing services), consumer services, sales of intangible properties (except for land-use right) | 6 |
An individual is usually a small-scale VAT taxpayer subject to the VAT rate of 3%. However, individuals engaged in privately-owned business may be recognised as general VAT taxpayers as long as certain criteria, such as sales amount, etc., have been met. Unlike general VAT taxpayers, small-scale taxpayers are not allowed to claim input VAT credits for the VAT paid on their purchases.
Individuals are exempt from VAT if the income derived is below certain thresholds. The provincial level tax bureaus are authorised to determine the exact thresholds within the following ranges:
The VAT rate for small-scale VAT payers is reduced from 3% to 1% for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2027.
## Consumption tax
A consumption tax is imposed on specified categories of luxury and environmental unfriendly goods, including cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, high-end cosmetics, jewellery, gasoline, automobiles, battery and coating, etc. The tax liability is computed based on the sales amount and/or the sales volume, depending on the nature of the goods.
## Urban construction and maintenance tax
Urban construction and maintenance tax is imposed at a certain rate on the amount of China's indirect taxes (i.e. VAT and consumption tax) payable by the taxpayer. Effectively, the taxpayers of indirect taxes are also the taxpayers of urban construction and maintenance tax. It is charged at three different rates depending on the taxpayer's location, i.e. 7% for urban areas, 5% for county areas, and 1% for other areas.
Urban construction and maintenance tax is not levied on VAT and/or consumption tax paid on imported goods and the sale of services/intangible assets by overseas individuals.
## Educational surtax
Educational surtax is imposed at 3% on the amount of China's indirect taxes (i.e. VAT and consumption tax) payable by the taxpayer. Effectively, the taxpayers of indirect taxes are also the taxpayers of educational surtax.
Educational surtax is not levied on VAT and/or consumption tax paid on imported goods and the sale of services/intangible assets by overseas individuals.
## Local educational surtax
Local educational surtax is levied at 2% on the amount of China's indirect taxes (i.e. VAT and consumption tax) payable by the taxpayer. Effectively, the taxpayers of indirect taxes are also the taxpayers of local educational surtax.
Local educational tax is not levied on VAT and/or consumption tax paid on imported goods and the sale of services/intangible assets by overseas individuals.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in China.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
At present, there are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in China.
## Real estate tax
A real estate tax, which is based on the value of the real property or rental received, is assessed annually on land and real properties used for business purposes or leased. The annual tax rate is 1.2% of the original value of real properties, and a tax reduction of 10% to 30% is commonly offered by local governments. Alternatively, tax may be assessed at 12% of the rental value. Individuals are exempt from real estate tax if the property is not used for business purposes or rented out.
## Urban and township land-use tax
An urban and township land-use tax is levied on taxpayers, including individuals, who utilise land within the area of city, country, township, and mining districts. It is computed annually based on the space of area actually occupied by a taxpayer multiplied by a fixed amount per square metre that is determined by the local governments. In many provinces/cities, individuals are exempt from urban and township land-use tax for holding residential properties.
## Land appreciation tax
A land appreciation tax is levied on the gain from the disposal of land-use rights or real estate properties at progressive rates ranging from 30% to 60%. Individuals are exempt from land appreciation tax for selling residential properties.
## Customs duties
Import and export customs duty is levied on goods that are allowed to be imported into or exported based on the relevant customs regulations. The Consignee of imported goods, consignor of export goods, and owner of entry articles are parties held liable for paying customs duties.
The customs classification of import and export goods is the base for the customs supervision, customs taxation, and customs statistics. In 2022, along with the revisions of the classified catalogue in ‘International Convention for Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System’ made by World Customs Organisation (WCO), large scale adjustments have been made to China’s import and export tariff system.
Import duty is charged in *ad valorem*, specific, compound, or sliding terms, etc. *Ad valorem* duty is charged based on the customs valuation of the goods. The dutiable value of the goods is multiplied by an *ad valorem* duty rate to arrive at the amount of duty payable. Duty collection on an *ad valorem* basis is the main taxation measure used by most countries, including China. The dutiable value of import and export goods is the taxable value determined by the Customs to levy *ad valorem* duties on the import and export goods, which is the base to value and levy customs duties payable of import and export goods and import links taxes payable of the import goods.
Import duties are categorised as normal tariff rate, Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate, contractual tariff rate, preferential tariff rate, tariff-rate quota (TRQ) rate, and temporary tariff rate.
The Country of Origin of imported goods also plays a part in determining the applicability of a number of other trade policies, such as TRQ, preferential tariffs, anti-dumping duty, anti-subsidy duty, etc.
Import and export goods are reduced with or exempted from customs duties, import VAT, and consumption tax according to state regulations.
The importation of raw materials under processing trade is bonded, and customs duty, import VAT, and consumption tax exemption is allowed on the part to be re-exported after processing.
For goods that enter into and exit from the customs special supervision zone, import duties, import VAT, and consumption tax are held over at the time of importation, which are to be exempted for exportation and to be paid for sales from the customs special supervision zone to domestic markets.
## Deed tax
A deed tax, generally at rates ranging from 3% to 5%, may be levied on the purchase or sale, gift or exchange of ownership of land use rights or real properties. The transferee/assignee is the taxpayer.
## Stamp tax
## Treatment of foreign-owned real estate
A foreign individual is subject to deed tax and stamp duty upon the purchase of real property in China.
A foreign individual is subject to IIT, VAT, real estate tax, stamp duty, plus some minor local taxes on its rental income.
A foreign individual is subject to IIT, VAT, land appreciation tax, and stamp duty, plus some minor local taxes, upon the disposal of real property in China. Individuals are exempt from land appreciation tax for selling residential properties and exempt from stamp duty for purchasing/selling residential properties.
## Motor vehicle acquisition tax
A motor vehicle acquisition tax, at a rate of 10% of the taxable consideration, is applicable on any purchase, import, self-production, receipt as a gift or award, etc. of an automobile, a tramcar, a trailer, or a motorcycle with a gas displacement of over 150 millilitres within China.
## Vehicle and vessel tax
A vehicle and vessel tax is a tax that is levied on all vehicles and vessels within China. A fixed amount is levied on a yearly basis. Transport vehicles are generally taxed on a fixed amount according to their own weight, with passenger cars, buses, and motorcycles being taxed on a fixed unit amount. Vessels are taxed on a fixed amount, according to the deadweight tonnage.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Taxable income is defined as ‘gross income in a tax year after deduction of non-taxable income, tax exempt income, various deductions, and allowable losses brought forward from previous years’. The accrual method of accounting should be used.
Gross income refers to monetary and non-monetary income derived by an enterprise from various sources, including, but not limited to, the sales of goods, provision of services, transfer of property, dividends, interest, rentals, royalties, and donations.
Non-taxable income refers to fiscal appropriation, governmental administration charges, governmental funds, and other income specified by the central government.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory must be valued according to costs. In computing the cost of inventories, the enterprise may choose one of the following methods: first in first out (FIFO), weighted average, or specific identification.
## Unrealised gain or loss due to changes in fair value
An unrealised gain or loss due to changes in the fair value of financial assets, financial liabilities, and investment properties held by an enterprise is not taxable/deductible for CIT purpose. The gain/loss is taxable/deductible only when the asset/liability actually is disposed of or realised.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated in the same way as ordinary income of a revenue-nature for a TRE.
## Dividend income
An exemption exists for CIT on dividend derived by a TRE from the direct investment into another TRE except for where the dividend is from stocks publicly traded on the stock exchanges and the holding period is less than 12 months.
Dividends derived by a non-TRE from China are subject to a 10% withholding tax (WHT). Starting from 1 January 2018, if a non-TRE shareholder uses dividends distributed from a China TRE to make direct investment into China or acquire another China TRE from third parties, the non-TRE shareholder is eligible for WHT deferral treatment on the dividends, provided that certain conditions are met. The non-TRE shareholder shall report and settle the deferred tax if it later recoups the investment through equity transfer, equity buyback, liquidation of the China TRE being invested, etc.
Dividends distributed by a foreign investment enterprise out of its pre-2008 profit to its non-TRE shareholder(s) are exempted from WHT.
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as ordinary income.
## Rental income
Rental income is treated as ordinary income.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as ordinary income.
## Partnership income
Partnerships registered in China are not subject to CIT. The income of a partnership is taxable at the partners’ level.
## Unrealised exchange gains
Unrealised exchange gain (loss) from the year-end translation of assets (liabilities) denominated in foreign currency generally is taxable (deductible).
## Foreign income
The worldwide income of a TRE and its branches both within and outside China is taxable. There are no provisions in the CIT law that allow foreign income directly earned by the TRE to be deferred for tax purposes. The CIT law contains a controlled foreign company (CFC) rule under which the unremitted earnings of a foreign company controlled by Chinese enterprises may be taxable in China (*see the [Group taxation](peoples-republic-of-china/corporate/group-taxation.html) section for more information*). A foreign tax credit is allowed for foreign income taxes paid on foreign-source income.
Enterprises engaged in tourism, modern service, and high-tech industries in the Hainan Free Trade Port (from 2020 to 2024) and Hengqin are exempted from CIT on the income generated by new overseas direct investment.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Non-TREs without establishments or places of business in China shall be subject to a WHT at 10% on gross income from dividends, interest, lease of property, royalties, and other China-source passive income unless reduced under a tax treaty.
If a non-TRE shareholder uses dividends distributed from a China TRE to make direct investment into China or acquire a China TRE from third parties, the non-TRE shareholder is eligible for WHT deferral treatment on the dividends, provided that certain conditions are met. The non-TRE shareholder shall report and settle the deferred tax if it later recoups the investment through equity transfer, equity buyback, liquidation of the China TRE, etc.
Dividends distributed by a foreign investment enterprise out of its pre-2008 profit to non-TRE shareholders are still exempted from WHT.
WHT rates under China’s tax treaties with other countries/nations are as follows (as of 31 December 2024):

# China, People's Republic of
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Taxable period
China's tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December, but tax filing is generally administered on a monthly basis.
## Tax returns
For employment income, the employer is obligated to file the provisional or final withholding IIT returns with its tax authority on a monthly basis.
For other categories of income, the tax return, either provisional or final, has to be filed on a monthly, annual, or transaction basis, depending on the specific circumstances.
Certain types of residents must file an annual reconciliation tax return on comprehensive income (*see Withholding requirements below for more information*). The filing period for the annual reconciliation tax return is between 1 March and 30 June of the following year.
There is no joint tax return in China. Husbands and wives are assessed and taxed separately.
Tax returns must be filed on a timely basis. Extensions to file may be granted under 'special circumstances' only.
## Withholding requirements
The payer of income is usually obligated to withhold the IIT payable upon payment of taxable income to the payee. Where the payer fails to withhold the full amount of IIT payable, it is the payee who is ultimately liable for the IIT payable and responsible for filing of the tax return and settling the IIT payable with the tax authority.
### Provisional tax withholding on comprehensive income paid to residents
The payer of employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties made to residents is generally obligated to perform provisional tax withholding on such income by adopting the required withholding method.
#### Employment income
The taxpayer can also choose to claim specific additional deductions on one's own through the annual reconciliation tax filing instead of having them included in the monthly provisional withholding tax calculation by the employer.
#### Remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties
Provisional tax withholding on the above income paid to residents is calculated on a monthly or transaction basis. The following deductions are allowed when calculating the taxable income for provisional tax withholding purpose:
Provisional tax at a flat rate of 20% should be withheld from the taxable income of author’s remuneration and royalties.
For income derived from labour services, provisional tax is calculated and withheld based on progressive tax rates ranging from 20% to 40% as below:
| Taxable labour service income (CNY) | Provisional withholding tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 20,000 | 20 |
| Over 20,000 to 50,000 | 30 |
| Over 50,000 | 40 |
### Actual tax withholding on employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties paid to non-residents
### Self-reporting requirement
The following types of individuals are obligated to self-report their income to the tax authorities:
Residents deriving comprehensive income are generally required to file an annual reconciliation tax return in case of the following:
For the tax years 2019 to 2027, residents whose annual comprehensive income or IIT underpaid on comprehensive income is less than the stipulated threshold can be exempted from the annual reconciliation tax filing if the withholding agents have fulfilled their responsibility of withholding the correct amount of IIT. The stipulated threshold is annual comprehensive income not exceeding CNY 120,000 or IIT underpaid not more than CNY 400.
## Payment of tax
Generally, the withholding IIT return should be filed and IIT payable should be settled by the 15th day of the month following the income receiving month.
For employment income, the employer is obligated to withhold and settle the IIT payable generally within 15 days after the end of each month.
A surcharge of 0.05% per day for all taxes, including IIT, will be assessed on delinquent payments, pursuant to the China Tax Administration and Collection Law.
## Audit cycle
There is no fixed audit cycle in China. Tax audit targets are selected pursuant to certain criteria.
## Statute of limitations
For unintentional errors (e.g. calculation errors) committed by the taxpayer/tax withholding agent in the tax filing, the statute of limitations is three years and extended to five years if the amount of tax underpaid is CNY 100,000 or more. There is no statute of limitations for tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, or defrauding of tax payment.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Residents are generally subject to China individual income tax (IIT) on their worldwide income. Non-residents are generally taxed in China on their China-source income only (*see the [Residence](peoples-republic-of-china/individual/residence.html) section for more information*).
An individual is taxed in China on one's income by category. China's IIT law groups personal income into 9 categories.
The 9 categories of income are:
1. Employment income (i.e. wages and salaries).
2. Remuneration for labour services.
3. Author's remuneration.
4. Royalties.
5. Business income.
6. Interest, dividends, and profit distribution.
7. Rental income.
8. Income from transfer of property.
9. Incidental income.
Each income category has its own tax rate(s), allowable deductions, etc.
For residents, employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties are combined as 'comprehensive income' for aggregate tax calculation purpose on an annual basis. Income from the other categories is taxed separately by category on a monthly or transaction basis.
For non-residents, income from each of the 9 categories is taxed separately on a monthly or transaction basis.
## Personal income tax rates
### Comprehensive income tax rates
For residents, calculation of IIT on annual comprehensive income is based on progressive tax rates (*see Table I below*) using the following formula:
(Annual taxable income x Tax rate) - Quick deduction
#### Table I
| Annual taxable income (CNY\*) (1) | Tax rate (%) | Quick deduction (CNY) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 36,000 | 3 | 0 |
| Over 36,000 to 144,000 | 10 | 2,520 |
| Over 144,000 to 300,000 | 20 | 16,920 |
| Over 300,000 to 420,000 | 25 | 31,920 |
| Over 420,000 to 660,000 | 30 | 52,920 |
| Over 660,000 to 960,000 | 35 | 85,920 |
| Over 960,000 | 45 | 181,920 |
\* renminbi
Notes
1. Annual taxable income after deducting the standard basic deduction, specific deductions, specific additional deductions, and other allowable deductions (*see the [Deductions](peoples-republic-of-china/individual/deductions.html) section for more information*).
For non-residents, IIT on employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties is calculated by each category on a monthly or transaction basis at the below progressive tax rates (*see Table II below*).
#### Table II
| Monthly taxable income (CNY) | Tax rate (%) | Quick deduction (CNY) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 3,000 | 3 | 0 |
| Over 3,000 to 12,000 | 10 | 210 |
| Over 12,000 to 25,000 | 20 | 1,410 |
| Over 25,000 to 35,000 | 25 | 2,660 |
| Over 35,000 to 55,000 | 30 | 4,410 |
| Over 55,000 to 80,000 | 35 | 7,160 |
| Over 80,000 | 45 | 15,160 |
###
### Business income tax rates
Income earned by individuals from privately-owned businesses, sole proprietorship enterprises, or partnerships is generally subject to IIT at progressive rates from 5% to 35%, as follows:
| Annual taxable income (CNY) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 30,000 | 5 |
| Over 30,000 to 90,000 | 10 |
| Over 90,000 to 300,000 | 20 |
| Over 300,000 to 500,000 | 30 |
| Over 500,000 | 35 |
###
### Tax rates for other personal income

# China, People's Republic of
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year commences on 1 January and ends on 31 December.
## Tax returns
Enterprises are required to file and pay provisional income taxes on a monthly or quarterly basis within 15 days following the end of each month/quarter, and file and settle their annual income tax return within five months after the end of the tax year, together with an audit certificate of a registered public accountant in China. Information on related-party transactions must be filed with the annual income tax return.
## Payment of tax
Enterprises are required to file and pay provisional income taxes on a monthly or quarterly basis within 15 days following the end of each month/quarter.
Settlement of annual tax payment is due, in conjunction with the annual income tax return, within five months after the end of the tax year.
## Tax audit process
There is no fixed audit cycle in China. Tax audit targets are selected pursuant to certain criteria.
## Statute of limitations
For unintentional errors (e.g. calculation errors) committed by the taxpayer in its tax filing, the statute of limitation is three years and extended to five years if the amount of tax underpaid is CNY 100,000 or more. For special tax adjustments, such as transfer pricing adjustments, adjustments under CFC rules, adjustments under the general anti-avoidance rules, the statute of limitation is ten years. There is no statute of limitation for tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, or defrauding of tax payment.
## Recent focus of Chinese tax authorities
Since 2009, the Chinese tax authorities have strengthened their tax administration on transfer pricing and income derived by non-TREs. The STA has released a number of tax circulars addressing the tax administration of transfer pricing, foreign contractors and service providers, WHT on passive income, etc.
Under the CIT Law, non-TREs are subject to CIT on the capital gain derived from the disposal of equity investment in Chinese companies. In addition, the transfer has to be effected at fair value so that any gain shall be recognised for tax purpose at the time when the transaction takes places (unless the transaction qualifies for deferral tax treatment provided under the tax regulations). The Chinese tax authorities have, in recent years, challenged and clawed back CIT on several equity transfer cases whereby non-TREs disposed of their equity investment in China to related parties at cost or below 'fair value'. In addition, they have become more knowledgeable on valuation theories and methodologies and are applying them in reviewing valuation reports in order to ascertain the fair value of equity transfer transactions for tax purposes.
In addition, the Chinese tax authorities have geared up their efforts in recent years to scrutinise investment structures involving intermediate holding companies incorporated in low-tax jurisdictions. One of their focuses is on the indirect equity transfer of Chinese companies by non-TREs. The income derived by a non-TRE from the disposal of a non-Chinese company is not taxable under China’s domestic income tax law. However, if the Chinese tax authorities are of the view that the non-TRE transferor has used an abusive arrangement to indirectly transfer the equity of the Chinese company (i.e. interposing and disposing of the special purpose vehicle for no reasonable commercial purpose, but just for avoidance of China withholding income tax), it may re-characterise the equity transfer based on the 'substance over form' principle and disregard the existence of the special purpose vehicle. Once the special purpose vehicle is disregarded, the transfer would be effectively a transfer of the underlying Chinese company’s equity, and the transfer gain would be China source and subject to China withholding income tax. In early 2015, the STA issued a circular that sets out new guidance on the assessment of indirect transfer of China taxable properties by non-TREs. This guidance extends the scope to capture all ‘China taxable properties’, including not only equity investment in Chinese companies but also immovable properties located in China and assets of an establishment or place of a foreign company in China. It also provides clearer criteria on how to assess ‘reasonable commercial purpose’ and introduces ‘safe harbour’ scenarios.
The STA issued a Departmental Interpretation Note (DIN) in 2010 for the tax treaty concluded between China and Singapore. It is the first time the STA has introduced a set of technical views, interpretation, and practice guidelines for the implementation of a tax treaty in such a comprehensive manner. More importantly, this set of interpretation is also applicable to other tax treaties concluded by China if the provisions of the relevant articles in those tax treaties are the same as those in the China/Singapore tax treaty. Thus, it is likely to have a wide impact to tax residents of other countries/regions that have entered into tax treaties with China.
For transfer pricing investigation, increasing scrutiny has been imposed on outbound related-party remittance, such as service fees and royalty payments. Specifically, in addition to the arm’s-length nature of the service fees and royalty transactions, the Chinese tax authorities may also require taxpayers to demonstrate the commercial substance of the overseas service provider or intangible property owner. The Chinese tax authorities are also stringent on activities for the decision-making, monitoring, control, and compliance purposes of the group, and may challenge the service remittance for group finance, tax, human resources, and legal activities, which is different from common positions taken by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Another focus of the Chinese tax authorities in transfer pricing investigation is location-specific advantages (e.g. location saving of Chinese low-cost resources, market premium of Chinese market). As such, the Chinese tax authorities often expect a different transfer pricing policy in China, which will pose difficulties on multinational groups who implement a consistent transfer pricing policy around the world.
## General anti-avoidance rules (GAAR)
There is a GAAR provision in the CIT law allowing the Chinese tax authorities to make adjustments to taxable revenue or taxable income where business arrangements, structures, or transactions are entered into without reasonable commercial purpose and result in a reduction, exemption, or deferral of tax payment. The Chinese tax authorities may initiate a GAAR investigation if they suspect that an enterprise undertakes any of the following arrangements: abuse of preferential tax treatments, abuse of tax treaties, abuse of corporate structure, use of tax havens for tax avoidance purposes, or other arrangements that do not have a reasonable commercial purpose.
The STA released the Administrative Measures on GAAR in late 2014. The Administrative Measures provides comprehensive guidance on the implementation of GAAR, including elaboration on certain principles, adjustment methods, procedures throughout the GAAR life cycle, and relevant documentation requirements.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
An individual engaged in the sale or importation of goods, the provision of services, and the sales of intangible properties and immovable properties is subject to VAT. For general VAT payers, input VAT can be credited against output VAT.
The applicable VAT rates (for general VAT payers) from 1 April 2019 are set out in the following table, and the rate for small-scale VAT payers is 3%.
| Industries | Applicable VAT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Sales or importation of goods | 13 |
| Sales or importation of necessity goods (e.g. agricultural products, water, gas) | 9 |
| Provision of repairs, replacement, and processing services | 13 |
| Tangible movable property leasing services | 13 |
| Transportation services, postal services, basic telecommunications services, construction services, immovable property leasing services, sales of immovable properties, transfer of land-use right | 9 |
| Value-added telecommunications services, financial services, modern services (except for leasing services), consumer services, sales of intangible properties (except for land-use right) | 6 |
An individual is usually a small-scale VAT taxpayer subject to the VAT rate of 3%. However, individuals engaged in privately-owned business may be recognised as general VAT taxpayers as long as certain criteria, such as sales amount, etc., have been met. Unlike general VAT taxpayers, small-scale taxpayers are not allowed to claim input VAT credits for the VAT paid on their purchases.
Individuals are exempt from VAT if the income derived is below certain thresholds. The provincial level tax bureaus are authorised to determine the exact thresholds within the following ranges:
The VAT rate for small-scale VAT payers is reduced from 3% to 1% for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2027.
## Consumption tax
A consumption tax is imposed on specified categories of luxury and environmental unfriendly goods, including cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, high-end cosmetics, jewellery, gasoline, automobiles, battery and coating, etc. The tax liability is computed based on the sales amount and/or the sales volume, depending on the nature of the goods.
## Urban construction and maintenance tax
Urban construction and maintenance tax is imposed at a certain rate on the amount of China's indirect taxes (i.e. VAT and consumption tax) payable by the taxpayer. Effectively, the taxpayers of indirect taxes are also the taxpayers of urban construction and maintenance tax. It is charged at three different rates depending on the taxpayer's location, i.e. 7% for urban areas, 5% for county areas, and 1% for other areas.
Urban construction and maintenance tax is not levied on VAT and/or consumption tax paid on imported goods and the sale of services/intangible assets by overseas individuals.
## Educational surtax
Educational surtax is imposed at 3% on the amount of China's indirect taxes (i.e. VAT and consumption tax) payable by the taxpayer. Effectively, the taxpayers of indirect taxes are also the taxpayers of educational surtax.
Educational surtax is not levied on VAT and/or consumption tax paid on imported goods and the sale of services/intangible assets by overseas individuals.
## Local educational surtax
Local educational surtax is levied at 2% on the amount of China's indirect taxes (i.e. VAT and consumption tax) payable by the taxpayer. Effectively, the taxpayers of indirect taxes are also the taxpayers of local educational surtax.
Local educational tax is not levied on VAT and/or consumption tax paid on imported goods and the sale of services/intangible assets by overseas individuals.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in China.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
At present, there are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in China.
## Real estate tax
A real estate tax, which is based on the value of the real property or rental received, is assessed annually on land and real properties used for business purposes or leased. The annual tax rate is 1.2% of the original value of real properties, and a tax reduction of 10% to 30% is commonly offered by local governments. Alternatively, tax may be assessed at 12% of the rental value. Individuals are exempt from real estate tax if the property is not used for business purposes or rented out.
## Urban and township land-use tax
An urban and township land-use tax is levied on taxpayers, including individuals, who utilise land within the area of city, country, township, and mining districts. It is computed annually based on the space of area actually occupied by a taxpayer multiplied by a fixed amount per square metre that is determined by the local governments. In many provinces/cities, individuals are exempt from urban and township land-use tax for holding residential properties.
## Land appreciation tax
A land appreciation tax is levied on the gain from the disposal of land-use rights or real estate properties at progressive rates ranging from 30% to 60%. Individuals are exempt from land appreciation tax for selling residential properties.
## Customs duties
Import and export customs duty is levied on goods that are allowed to be imported into or exported based on the relevant customs regulations. The Consignee of imported goods, consignor of export goods, and owner of entry articles are parties held liable for paying customs duties.
The customs classification of import and export goods is the base for the customs supervision, customs taxation, and customs statistics. In 2022, along with the revisions of the classified catalogue in ‘International Convention for Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System’ made by World Customs Organisation (WCO), large scale adjustments have been made to China’s import and export tariff system.
Import duty is charged in *ad valorem*, specific, compound, or sliding terms, etc. *Ad valorem* duty is charged based on the customs valuation of the goods. The dutiable value of the goods is multiplied by an *ad valorem* duty rate to arrive at the amount of duty payable. Duty collection on an *ad valorem* basis is the main taxation measure used by most countries, including China. The dutiable value of import and export goods is the taxable value determined by the Customs to levy *ad valorem* duties on the import and export goods, which is the base to value and levy customs duties payable of import and export goods and import links taxes payable of the import goods.
Import duties are categorised as normal tariff rate, Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate, contractual tariff rate, preferential tariff rate, tariff-rate quota (TRQ) rate, and temporary tariff rate.
The Country of Origin of imported goods also plays a part in determining the applicability of a number of other trade policies, such as TRQ, preferential tariffs, anti-dumping duty, anti-subsidy duty, etc.
Import and export goods are reduced with or exempted from customs duties, import VAT, and consumption tax according to state regulations.
The importation of raw materials under processing trade is bonded, and customs duty, import VAT, and consumption tax exemption is allowed on the part to be re-exported after processing.
For goods that enter into and exit from the customs special supervision zone, import duties, import VAT, and consumption tax are held over at the time of importation, which are to be exempted for exportation and to be paid for sales from the customs special supervision zone to domestic markets.
## Deed tax
A deed tax, generally at rates ranging from 3% to 5%, may be levied on the purchase or sale, gift or exchange of ownership of land use rights or real properties. The transferee/assignee is the taxpayer.
## Stamp tax

A foreign individual is subject to IIT, VAT, real estate tax, stamp duty, plus some minor local taxes on its rental income.
A foreign individual is subject to IIT, VAT, land appreciation tax, and stamp duty, plus some minor local taxes, upon the disposal of real property in China. Individuals are exempt from land appreciation tax for selling residential properties and exempt from stamp duty for purchasing/selling residential properties.

A motor vehicle acquisition tax, at a rate of 10% of the taxable consideration, is applicable on any purchase, import, self-production, receipt as a gift or award, etc. of an automobile, a tramcar, a trailer, or a motorcycle with a gas displacement of over 150 millilitres within China.
## Vehicle and vessel tax
A vehicle and vessel tax is a tax that is levied on all vehicles and vessels within China. A fixed amount is levied on a yearly basis. Transport vehicles are generally taxed on a fixed amount according to their own weight, with passenger cars, buses, and motorcycles being taxed on a fixed unit amount. Vessels are taxed on a fixed amount, according to the deadweight tonnage.

There is a prescribed formula for determining the amount of refund, under which full refund of input VAT is not available to many exported goods and the exporter will suffer different degrees of export VAT costs.
In addition, certain taxable activities, including a few types of sale of goods, services, and cross-border transactions, are applicable to the VAT exemption treatment. In that respect, the relevant input VAT incurred cannot be credited or refunded.
The rate for small-scale VAT payers is 3%. From 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2027, the VAT rate for small-scale VAT payers is reduced from 3% to 1%.

Local educational surtax is levied at 2% on the amount of China's indirect taxes (i.e. VAT and consumption tax) payable by the taxpayer. Effectively, the taxpayers of indirect taxes are also the taxpayers of local educational surtax.
Local educational tax is not levied on VAT and/or consumption tax paid on imported goods and the sale of services/intangible assets by overseas entities.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Generally, an enterprise is allowed to deduct reasonable expenditures that actually have been incurred and are related to the generation of income.
## Depreciation of fixed assets
Fixed assets with useful lives of more than 12 months must be capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the CIT regulations. Generally, depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method. Production-nature biological assets, such as livestock held for breeding and commercial timber, also have to be capitalised and depreciated using the straight-line method.
Under the straight-line method, the cost of an item, less its residual value, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Residual value should be reasonably determined based on the nature and usage of the asset. The CIT law provides minimum useful lives for the following assets:
| Assets | Years |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings and structures | 20 |
| Aircraft, trains, vessels, machinery, mechanisms, and other production equipment | 10 |
| Appliances, tools, and furniture etc. related to production and business operations | 5 |
| Means of transport other than aircraft, trains, and vessels | 4 |
| Electronic equipment | 3 |
| Production-nature biological assets in the nature of forestry | 10 |
| Production-nature biological assets in the nature of livestock | 3 |
Shorter tax depreciation life or accelerated depreciation is allowed for particular types of fixed assets (e.g. fixed assets that need to be replaced more frequently due to advancement of technology, fixed assets that suffer from constant vibration or severe corrosion).
New fixed assets acquired by companies engaging in manufacturing industries and new fixed assets and equipment acquired specifically for R&D purposes may be depreciated over a shorter period or under an accelerated depreciation method.
Where a shorter depreciation period method is applied, the minimum depreciation period cannot be less than 60% of the minimum depreciation period as prescribed in the CIT Law; where an accelerated depreciation method is applied, the double-declining-balance method or sum-of-years-digits method can be used.
The following capital expenditure may be expensed-off in one lump sum in the year of acquisition:
## Amortisation of intangibles and goodwill
A deduction is allowed for amortisation of intangible assets, such as, but not limited to, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and land-use rights. Generally, intangible assets have to be amortised over a period of not less than ten years. For an intangible asset obtained through capital contribution or assignment, it can be amortised according to the useful life prescribed in the laws or agreed in the contracts, if any. However, acquired goodwill is not deductible until the invested enterprise is entirely transferred or liquidated.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisational and start-up expenses are tax deductible fully in the first year of operation.
From 1 January 2023, 200% of the eligible R&D expenses incurred by enterprises are tax-deductible. For R&D expenses that have formed intangible assets, the tax amortisation shall be based on 200% of the cost of the intangible assets.
From 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2027, 220% of the eligible R&D expenses incurred by integrated circuit enterprises and enterprises manufacturing industrial mother machines are tax-deductible. For R&D expenses that have formed intangible assets, the tax amortisation shall be based on 220% of the cost of the intangible assets.
## Asset loss
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans generally is tax-deductible. For interest expenses on borrowings from non-financial institutions by a non-financial institution, the portion that does not exceed the commercial rate is deductible. The tax deduction of interest paid to related parties is subject to the thin capitalisation rule under the CIT law (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*).
## Reserves and provisions
Provisions for asset impairment reserves (e.g. bad debt provisions) and risk reserves generally are not tax-deductible unless otherwise prescribed in the tax rules. Financial institutions and insurance companies may deduct certain provisions and reserves, subject to the caps specified in the relevant tax circulars.
## Contingent liabilities
The CIT law does not specifically address the deductibility of contingent liabilities. According to the general principle of the CIT law, contingent liabilities are liabilities that an enterprise has not actually incurred and thus shall not be tax-deductible.
## Charitable donations
Charitable donations are tax-deductible at up to 12% of the annual accounting profit, and any excess amount in the current year can be carried forward and deductible in the following three years. From 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2025, donation for poverty alleviation purpose to targeted poverty-stricken areas can be fully deducted. Non-charitable donations, as well as sponsorship expenditures that are non-advertising and non-charitable in nature, are not deductible.
## Wages and staff welfare expenses
Reasonable wages and salaries of employees incurred by an enterprise are tax-deductible. Directors’ fees are also tax-deductible. As an incentive to encourage the hiring of handicapped people, 200% of the actual salary expenses paid to handicapped staff are deductible.
Basic social security contributions, including basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, injury insurance, maternity insurance, and housing funds, that are made by an enterprise in accordance with the scope and criteria as prescribed by the state or provincial governments are deductible.
Commercial insurance premiums paid for investors or employees shall not be tax-deductible unless they are paid for safety insurance for workers conducting special types of work.
Staff welfare expenses, labour union fees, and staff education expenses are tax-deductible at up to 14%, 2%, and 8% of the total salary expenses, respectively.
## Entertainment expenses
Entertainment expenses are tax-deductible up to the lesser of 60% of the costs actually incurred and 0.5% of the sales or business income of that year. The excess amount must not be carried forward to and deducted in the following tax years.
## Advertising expenses and business promotion expenses
Advertising expenses and business promotion expenses are deductible at up to 15% (30% for certain enterprises in the cosmetics, medicine, and beverage industries) of the sales (business) income of that year unless otherwise prescribed in the tax regulations. Any excess amount is allowed to be carried forward and deductible in the following tax years. Advertising expenses and business promotion expenses incurred by the tobacco industry are entirely not tax-deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines, penalties, and losses arising from confiscation of property are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
CIT payments and surcharges that are imposed on overdue taxes are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Net operating losses
Generally, tax losses can be carried forward for no longer than five years starting from the year subsequent to the year in which the loss was incurred. Loss carryback is not permitted.
Tax loss can be carried forward for ten years for enterprises in the following industries:
From 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026, tax loss can be carried forward for 13 years for HNTEs or technological SMEs registered in Nansha of Guangzhou, provided that the HNTE or technological SME is engaged in the high-tech key industries in the Catalogue for CIT Preferential Treatments of Nansha.
## Payments to affiliates
Management fees for stewardship are not deductible, but services fees paid for genuine services provided by affiliates in China or overseas and charged at arm’s length should be deductible. Other payments to affiliates, such as royalties, are also tax-deductible, provided that the charges are at arm’s length.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Group taxation is not permitted under the CIT law unless otherwise prescribed by the State Council.
## Transfer pricing
All enterprises are required to conduct transactions with related parties on an arm’s-length basis. The Chinese tax authorities are empowered to make adjustments to transactions between related parties that are not conducted at arm’s length and result in the reduction of taxable income of the enterprise or its related parties using the following appropriate methods: comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus method, transactional net margin method, profit split method, and other methods (e.g. cost approach, market approach, income approach) that are consistent with the arm’s-length principle. In June 2016, the State Taxation Administration (STA) issued a circular that imposed new transfer pricing compliance requirements in China, including annual reporting forms for related-party transactions (RPT forms), country-by-country (CbC) reporting, and transfer pricing documentation, all of which contain substantial changes to the previous rules. Specifically, the transfer pricing documentation requirement has adopted a three-tiered approach, including a master file, local file, and special issue file (i.e. cost sharing agreement special issue file and thin capitalisation special issue file).
The STA also issued a revised circular on advance pricing arrangements (APAs) in October 2016, which provides process and requirements for an enterprise to apply for an APA as well as the situations where an APA application will be prioritised or declined.
## Thin capitalisation
The CIT law has a thin capitalisation rule disallowing interest expense arising from excessive related-party loans. The safe harbour debt/equity ratio for enterprises in the financial industry is 5:1 and for enterprises in other industries is 2:1. However, if there is sufficient evidence (e.g. a thin capitalisation special issue file) to show that the financing arrangement is at arm’s length, these interests may still be fully deductible even if the ratios are exceeded.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Under the CFC rule, the undistributed profits of CFCs located in low-tax jurisdictions with an effective income tax rate of less than 12.5% may be taxed as a deemed distribution to the TRE shareholders. The Chinese tax authorities have published a list of countries (i.e. a 'white list') that they do not regard to be low-tax jurisdictions.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Under the CIT law, a branch of a non-TRE in China is taxed at the branch level. If there is more than one branch, they can select its main office in China to conduct consolidated CIT filing, which requires the overall tax payable to be calculated and adjusted on a consolidated basis but with tax payment settled separately at the respective branches’ locations.

Notes
1. ‘2 + 3 years tax holiday’ refers to two years of exemption from CIT followed by three years of 50% reduction of CIT.
2. ‘3 + 3 years tax holiday’ refers to three years of exemption plus three years of 50% reduction of CIT.

4. Certified animation enterprises that produce self-developed animation products are eligible to enjoy the same CIT incentives as encouraged software enterprises.
For income derived from the transfer of qualified technology in a tax year, the portion that does not exceed CNY 5 million shall be exempted from CIT and the portion that exceeds CNY 5 million shall be allowed a 50% reduction of CIT.
A CIT exemption applies to the dividend derived by a TRE from the direct investment into another TRE, except where the dividend is from stocks publicly traded on the stock exchanges and the holding period is less than 12 months.
A CIT exemption also applies to the income derived by recognised non-profit-making organisations engaging in non-profit-making activities.
## Reduced tax rate
## Reduction of revenue
Where an enterprise uses resources specified by the state as its major raw materials to produce non-restricted and non-prohibited products, only 90% of the income derived is taxable.
## Offset of certain venture capital investment
For a venture capital enterprise that makes an equity investment in a non-listed small to medium-sized new/high tech enterprise or a start-up technology enterprise for more than two years, 70% of its investment amount may be used to offset against the taxable income of the venture capital enterprise in the year after the holding period has reached two years. Any portion that is not utilised in that year can be carried forward and deducted in the following years. A Chinese corporate partner of a venture capital in the form of a limited partnership is also eligible for such incentive.
## Investment tax credit
Enterprises purchasing and using equipment specified by the state for environmental protection, energy and water conservation, or production safety purposes are eligible for a tax credit of 10% of the investment in such equipment. Any unutilised amount can be carried forward and creditable in the following five years.
## Other incentives
There are also tax incentives in relation to the deduction of expenses and cost (e.g. additional R&D deduction, shorter tax depreciation period, and accelerated depreciation). *See the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information*.
## Foreign tax credit
A TRE is allowed to claim foreign tax credit in relation to foreign income tax already paid overseas in respect of income derived from sources outside China on a country-basket basis or under the comprehensive method. The creditable foreign tax also includes foreign income tax paid by qualified CFCs. However, the creditable amount may not exceed the amount of income tax otherwise payable in China in respect of the foreign-sourced income. In addition, there is a five-year carryforward period for any unutilised foreign tax.

## Choice of business entity
According to the Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China and its detailed implementation rules, from 1 January 2020, foreign investors (including foreign individuals, enterprises, and other organisations) may directly or indirectly invest in China. Foreign investors shall assess whether their investment projects are restricted, prohibited, or encouraged in China before they make the investment decisions. Foreign companies, enterprises, or individuals may establish foreign-invested enterprises, partnerships, or representative offices in China. Certain foreign financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, may, subject to approval, set up branches in China. For certain foreign invested industries and projects, approval is needed from the relevant Chinese government authorities.
## Exchange controls
## Intellectual properties
Patents, trademarks, and copyrights are governed by separate laws and administered by separate governmental bodies. The government encourages the development and transfer of intellectual properties. The transfer of qualified technology and qualified technical services are exempted from VAT.
## Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities
Both Chinese domestic and foreign investors increasingly are using M&A transactions to establish or expand their Chinese operations.
The MoF and the STA jointly released several circulars that address the CIT treatment for six forms of restructuring transactions, namely, change in legal form, debt restructuring, equity acquisition, assets acquisition, merger, and spin-off. The general principle is that enterprises undergoing corporate restructuring should recognise the gain/loss from the transfer of relevant assets/equity at fair value when the transaction takes place. However, if certain prescribed conditions are satisfied, the parties involved could opt for special tax treatments, which are essentially tax deferral tax treatment. In other words, recognition of gain/loss of the transferor from transfer of assets/equity can be deferred with respect to the equity-payment portion; and the transferee may take over the transferor’s tax basis of the acquired assets/equity. Such special tax treatments are only available to a very few specific types of cross-border transactions.
## Development of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in China
In late June 2014, the Chinese government reached an agreement in substance with the United States (US) on the terms of a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). However, as of 31 December 2024, the China-US IGA has not been signed, and the financial institutions in China have not started implementing FATCA.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and the Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
China has been actively involved in the BEPS project as a partner of the OECD and one of the G20 members. After the final reports on all the 15 action plans were endorsed in 2015, China has implemented and localised the BEPS action plans on a needed basis.
China imposed new transfer pricing compliance requirements, including annual reporting forms for related-party transactions (RPT forms), country-by-country (CbC) reporting, and transfer pricing documentation, all of which contain substantial changes to the previous rules.
China entered into the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) for the Automatic Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports in 2016.
China also entered into the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) in June 2017, and, on 25 May 2022, China ratified the MLI and deposited its instrument of ratification to the OECD. For Mainland China, the MLI has taken effect from 1 September 2022. Some important positions of China in relation to the articles in the MLI are as follows:
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
China entered into the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information. In May 2017, the relevant Chinese authorities jointly issued the Administrative Measures on Due Diligence Procedures for Non-residents’ Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (the Measures) to implement CRS in China. Financial institutions established in China are required to carry out due diligence procedures on financial accounts starting from 1 July 2017. China completed the exchange of the first round of financial account information by September 2018.

## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Foreign taxes paid on non-China-source income may be claimed as a credit on the China tax return, but only to the extent of the IIT payable on the same category of income derived from the same country. Unused excess credits are non-refundable and can only be carried forward for a maximum of five years. Documentary evidence of the tax payment (e.g. tax payment certificate, tax clearance certificate) to substantiate claims of foreign tax credits is required by the Chinese tax authorities.
## Tax treaties
As of 31 December 2024, China has concluded tax treaties/arrangements with 114 countries/regions.
As of 31 December 2024, China has signed tax information exchange agreements with Argentina, Bahamas, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liechtenstein, and San Marino.
As of 31 December 2024, China has totalisation agreements in force with 11 countries, including Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Serbia, Spain, and Switzerland. China has also signed a totalisation agreement with France, which has not entered into force.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Personal deductions from comprehensive income for residents
When calculating taxable comprehensive income for residents, IIT law allows the following personal deductions (non-refundable and no carryback/forward provisions).
### Standard basic deduction
As of 1 January 2019, the amount of the standard basic deduction is CNY 60,000 *per annum* (i.e. CNY 5,000 for monthly tax withholding purpose).
### Specific deductions
Chinese social security contributions made in accordance with the Social Security Law and contributions made to the statutory Housing Fund are deductible for IIT purpose.
### Specific additional deductions
Residents deriving comprehensive income, if eligible, can claim the following specific additional deductions when calculating the annual taxable income:
| Deductible item | Deductible amount (CNY) |
| --- | --- |
| Child education | 2,000 per child per month |
| Continued education | 400 per month or 3,600 per year depending on the type of qualified continued education |
| Mortgage interest | 1,000 per month |
| Rental expense | 800, 1,100, or 1,500 per month depending on the location |
| Elderly care | Up to 3,000 per month depending on the status of the taxpayer |
| Major medical expense | Qualified self-paid portion above 15,000 and capped at 80,000 per year for each eligible individual |
| Care expense for children under the age of 3 | 2,000 per child per month |
### Other allowable deductions
There are also certain deductible items specifically provided by various IIT regulations, such as employee contributions to qualified corporate annuities, premiums paid to commercial health insurance eligible for IIT incentives, premiums paid to commercial endowment insurance or contribution made to individual pension accounts eligible for IIT deferral treatment, etc.
## Personal deductions from employment income for non-residents
When calculating taxable employment income for non-residents, IIT law only allows the standard basic deduction of CNY 5,000 per month.
## Charitable contributions
If an individual makes charitable contributions to qualified domestic non-profit organisations, such contributions are generally deductible to the extent of 30% of one's taxable income reported. This deduction is applicable to all categories of income.
## Remuneration for labour services, author's remuneration, and royalties
A deduction equal to 20% of the gross receipt is allowed when determining the income from labour services, author's remuneration, and royalties. A further deduction of 30% is allowable for author’s remuneration.
## Rental income
The following deductions are provided for rental income:
## Business deductions
There are specific and complex tax rules to address the deductions available for income derived from the operation of privately-owned businesses, sole proprietorship enterprises, and partnerships. Certain deduction caps are similar to those applicable to companies that are subject to corporate income tax.
In addition, for individuals who derive both comprehensive income and business income during the tax year, the standard basic deduction of CNY 60,000, specific deductions, specific additional deductions, and other allowable deductions (i.e. personal deductions applicable to comprehensive income) are allowed to be deducted from either income category provided that no double deduction is claimed.
## Income from the transfer of property (capital gain)
For sales of property, the original cost of the property and reasonable expenses incurred are deductible from the sales proceeds to arrive at the taxable income.
## Losses
Generally, capital losses are not allowed to be set off against other income or carried forward to other years.
Losses from privately-owned business and sole proprietorship enterprise can be carried forward for five years.

## Treatment of partnerships
Partnerships established in China are not taxable entities. The income of a partnership is taxable at the partners' level. The corporate partners and individual partners are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) and IIT, respectively, on the taxable income so allocated. In other words, the taxpayers are the corporate partners and individual partners, instead of the partnership.
## Anti-avoidance rules
Anti-avoidance rules are introduced into the IIT Law taking effect since 1 January 2019. The tax authorities are provided legal basis to perform tax adjustment in case of transactions against arm’s-length principles, controlled foreign company (CFC) arrangements in tax havens, as well as arrangements deriving inappropriate tax benefits without reasonable commercial substance.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Employment income
Chinese social security contributions made by the employer in accordance with the Social Security Law are not taxable for IIT purposes.
Overseas social security contributions made by the employer, regardless of whether they are made on a voluntary or mandatory basis, are subject to IIT. IIT on these contributions is normally imposed when the contribution is made instead of at the time of cash withdrawal and/or distribution.
Statutory pension income received after retirement in accordance with the Social Security Law is tax exempted income.
## Equity compensation
Income derived by employees from equity plans upon exercise/vesting is generally treated as employment income in nature. Where applicable, equity plan income may be allocated between China and non-China sources. Depending on the features of the plan (e.g. equity holding interest relationship between the listed company and the employee's employing entity, completion of the required record filing procedure), equity plan income may be eligible for favourable tax calculation treatment.
## Labour service income
Labour service income refers to gross income derived by individuals from independent services such as design, medical practice, legal practice, accounting, consulting, etc.
## Business income
In China, an individual may engage in the following types of businesses: privately-owned business, sole proprietorship enterprise, and partnership enterprise. These three types of business entities are taxed at the individual investor/partner level rather than the entity level. Qualified expenses and costs are allowed to be deducted from the gross business income to arrive at the net taxable income (*see the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information*).
## Income from the transfer of property (capital gain)
Income from the transfer of property includes income from transfer of securities, shares, real estate properties, shares of partnership interest, etc. The cost basis of the property and reasonable expenses incurred are deductible from the sales proceeds to arrive at the taxable income.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is taxed on the gross amount received, without deductions.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxed on the gross amount received, without deductions. Interest income received from bank deposits in China is currently not taxable.
## Rental income
Rental income refers to income derived through the leasing of buildings, granting of rights to land usage, machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, ships, and other property.
## Income from intellectual property (IP)
Royalties are subject to the progressive tax rates of 3% to 45% applicable to comprehensive income but may be reduced under a tax treaty/arrangement.
Income derived from the transfer of IP is considered capital gain and subject to the flat tax rate of 20%.
Author's remuneration is subject to the progressive tax rates of 3% to 45% applicable to comprehensive income.
Certain income derived by foreign individuals in relation to IP is not taxable in China, depending on the individual's physical presence in China (*see the [Residence](residence.html) section for more information*) and the source of the income.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Dividend income is generally taxed at 20% unless otherwise provided for in the applicable income tax treaty. Dividend income derived from shares traded on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges is entitled to 50% or 100% tax reduction, depending on the length of holding.
Capital gains from transfer of shares traded on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges are generally exempt from IIT.
Interest on government bonds and finance bonds issued by the Chinese Government, as well as bank deposit interest income, is currently exempt from IIT.
Income of diplomatic representatives, consuls, and other personnel of foreign embassies and consulates is also exempt from IIT.
China's domestic law states that those foreign individuals who stay in China for no more than 90 days within a tax year may be exempted from IIT on their China-sourced employment income provided such income is paid or borne by a non-China entity (*see the [Residence](residence.html) section for more information*).
