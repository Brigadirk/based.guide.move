## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT applies to all corporations and to individuals or associations of individuals rendering personal services.
The general VAT rate is 10%.
A special VAT rate of 5% applies on the following products and activities:
## Customs taxes
As products are introduced into Paraguay directly by the local importer, the importer is responsible for payment of the related taxes (VAT on imports) before clearing the goods from Paraguayan customs, apart from customs tariffs. The other expenses involved in the import of products are the following:
Other expenses should be added to the above, such as photocopying, handling fees, customs agent fees, etc.
## Excise taxes
The excise tax, called the selective tax on consumption, is assessed on local goods and imported products listed, either specifically or generically, in the legislation. The importation of goods listed and the first sale in the 'gate of the plant' of goods produced in Paraguay are taxed. The selective tax on consumption is collected independently of customs duty.
Some goods subject to this tax include whiskey and other alcoholic beverages, beer, tobacco products, petroleum, etc.
The Tax Reform has included an additional rate of 2% on packaged products from the food industry that exceed 500 Kcal per PYG 100, except oils and fats of animal and vegetable origin, as well as seeds in their natural state.
## Real estate tax
Real estate tax is levied annually at 1% of the fiscal value of the property, which is generally less than actual value (or market value). A tax rate of 0.5% applies if the area of rural property is smaller than five hectares and is used for agricultural or cattle ranching. In certain areas, an additional tax is levied on the fiscal value of vacant and semi-vacant land when the area of the built-up portion falls within certain determined percentage limits. Large tracts of land in rural areas are subject to an additional tax determined on a percentage basis and to a proportional tax of 0.5% to 1% on the fiscal value of tracts with areas ranging from 10,000 to 60,000 or more hectares.
The 1992 Paraguayan Constitution established that municipalities and departments are entitled to the tax revenues directly related to real estate. Collection of these taxes is the responsibility of municipal governments.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Paraguay.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (*see below*).
## Social security contributions
In Paraguay, there is a compulsory social security system through which it is required that the employers register their employees.
The calculation basis constitutes every wage item, in cash or goods, except the annual mandatory bonus and family allowance.
The monthly rates are as follows:
| Contribution | Commercial entity (%) | Financial entity (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 9.0 | 11 |
| Employer | 16.5 | 17 |
| Total | 25.5 | 28 |
The employee’s contribution is withheld from salary by the employer, which is a designated withholding agent. The employer’s contributions are computed on total payroll and are paid together with the employee’s withholding to the Social Security Institute.

# Paraguay
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Taxable period
For the CIT and LTIT, the taxable period is the calendar year. Regarding the AIT, the taxable period is as follows:
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are submitted on a fiscal-year basis as a self-assessment and must be filed by the fourth month following the end of the fiscal year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is due on varying days in the fourth month following the end of the fiscal year, depending on the taxpayer ID number, according to a calendar established by the Treasury Ministry. Four equal advance payments are made throughout the year, calculated based on 100% of the tax due in the previous year. Payments must be made in May, July, September, and November of each year after the due date for filing the income tax return, according to the calendar established by the tax authorities.
### Penalties
Tax legislation provides the following penalties:
## Tax audit process
The auditing process is performed by the tax authorities when there is a certainty or suspicion of tax evasion. Additionally, the taxpayer may be audited according to a draw process that is made by the tax authority.
The tax law also establishes an obligatory tax audit, which has to be made by external auditors, when the taxpayer obtains PYG 6 billion of gross income during the year. An annual audit report on tax compliance rules is presented to and reviewed by the tax authorities. When a tax issue is identified, the tax authority may apply a penalty to the taxpayer.
## Statute of limitations
The tax authority may audit the last five fiscal years.
The tax authority is focusing on purchases invoices. It is important to note, that in order to consider an expense as deductible for tax purposes, it must comply with the formal requirements established by Law.
In addition to this, these vouchers must also comply with the mentioned formal requirements in order to consider them as a part of the VAT credit.
It should be noted that Paraguay, through Law No. 6656 of 26 November 2020, approves the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, amended by the Provisions of the Protocol that amends the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
In this context, Paraguay is a cooperating country to share tax information with other tax authorities abroad.

# Paraguay
## Overview
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Paraguay, a landlocked country in South America, is bordered by Brazil to the east, Argentina to the southwest, and Bolivia to the northwest. It consists of 17 departments, with a separate district for the capital city of Asunción. The official languages of Paraguay are Spanish and Guaraní, and the currency is the guaraní (PYG).
Paraguay achieved a significant economic expansion in Latin America in recent years. After an economic contraction of 1.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012, the Paraguayan economy showed a recovery between 2013 and 2019, mainly due to record agricultural production and the recovery of international markets for the export of beef, mainly.
Regarding the 2020 period (affected by the COVID-19 pandemic), a GDP contraction of 1% is estimated according to data published by the Central Bank of Paraguay. The sectors affected being industry and services, mainly the latter. Due to the participation of the agricultural sector in GDP, Paraguay became one of the countries with the lowest GDP contraction in the region.
Paraguay stands out as the leading exporter of renewable electricity in South America and is among the largest net exporters of clean energy worldwide. In addition, according to data published by the United States Ministry of Agriculture, Paraguay ranks as the largest exporter of organic sugar in the world, the fourth largest soybeans exporter, and the tenth largest in soybean processing capacity. Paraguay is also the tenth largest exporter of beef, eighth largest corn exporter, and eleventh largest rice exporter in the world.
In Asuncion, in the central region, commercial activities (imports, exports, related services) and financial services have developed significantly.
Paraguay has achieved an important participation in the capital gains markets with the placement of national bonds, due to the macroeconomic stability achieved over the years that mainly includes sustained economic growth, fiscal discipline, and accumulation of international reserves, among others.
It is important to mention that, as of 1 January 2020, a new tax reform is in force. It includes certain changes, such as the extension of the source or territoriality principle, taxation of digital services, and transfer pricing rules, among others. As of 1 January 2021, the transfer pricing regulation is in force, and it follows the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines.
Finally, within the demographic statistics it is highlighted that the population of Paraguay is approximately 7.2 million people, of which 48% are economically active. The middle class has increased by 45% and represents approximately 24% of the total population (1.5 million people).

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
10% Business Income Tax (IRE) is applicable to all Paraguayan income, profits, or earnings that come from all types of economic, primary, secondary, and tertiary activities, including agricultural, commercial, industrial or services. The income generated by assets, rights, and obligations, as well as the acts of disposition of these, will also constitute a taxable event.
## Simplified Regime for Medium-sized Companies (IRE SIMPLE)
The Law establishes an IRE SIMPLE, applicable to certain taxpayers who carry out activities taxed by the IRE who may opt for this Regime when their income accrued in the previous fiscal year does not exceed the amount of 2 billion Paraguayan guaranies (PYG).
Such taxpayers may settle this tax by determining their net income on a real or presumed basis, whichever is less.
## Simplified Regime for Small Businesses (RESIMPLE)
The Law establishes RESIMPLE, intended for those sole proprietorships that carry out activities taxed by the IRE, who may opt for this Regime when their gross income accrued in the previous fiscal year is equal to or less than PYG 80 million.
The taxpayers of this Regime will pay a monthly sum according to the payment schedule established by the tax administration. The tax amount is from PYG 20,000 to PYG 80,000, which depends on the annual income.
The tax administration may establish that said payments are accumulated for their effectiveness on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.
## Local income taxes
There are no other income taxes in Paraguay.

## Social security contributions
In Paraguay, there is a compulsory social security system through which it is required that the employers register their employees.
The calculation basis constitutes every wage item, in cash or goods, except the annual mandatory bonus and family allowance.
The monthly rates are as follows:
| **Contribution** | **Commercial entity (%)** | **Financial entity (%)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 9.0 | 11 |
| Employer | 16.5 | 17 |
| Total | 25.5 | 28 |
The employee’s contribution is withheld from salary by the employer, which is a designated withholding agent. The employer´s contributions are computed on total payroll and are paid together with the employee´s withholding to the Social Security Institute.
For some positions that are independent (e.g. Administrators, Directors, Managers), the contribution to the social security system is optional.
Foreigners should comply with the Migration Laws for practicing activities with salaries within the country.

# Paraguay
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
The non-resident tax regulates the WHT on payments to foreign suppliers for the benefit of Paraguayan entities.
The withholdings are to be made from the payments made by local entities for such services.
## Non-resident tax
In Paraguay, the principle of territoriality applies, so if entities established abroad obtain income from a Paraguayan source, they will be subject to WHT.
To this end, the non-resident tax was created, which affects income, profits, or benefits obtained by individuals, legal entities, or other entities not residing in the country. It applies to taxable events established for CIT or PIT.
Individuals, legal entities, and other entities established abroad are taxpayers of this tax when they obtain income, profit, or benefits that are covered by this tax.
The law establishes the tax base on which WHT rates should be applied because a portion of the income is considered to be obtained abroad, depending on the type of service and the territorial aspect of the tax. Tax bases are defined as a conclusive presumption (i.e. it does not accept proof to the contrary), and the 15% rate must be applied thereto.
### Opportunity for withholding, settlement, and payment
The attachment of the obligation shall occur when the funds become available, when they are remitted abroad, or whenever a payment is made, whichever comes first. Compensation, novation, transaction, and other allowed means for paying an obligation shall deem the funds to have been made available.
In the case of individuals providing independent personal services, they shall act as withholding agents only when they pay for services of a similar nature and are directly related to obtaining their taxed income from these services.
In transfers of shares or capital shares of companies established in the country between individuals, legal entities, or non-resident entities, the companies established in the country issuing the securities subject to the transaction shall be responsible for paying the seller's tax for such a transaction. In this case, the attachment of the obligation will be the date of the transaction or contract.
In international freight, the tax will be paid before the withdrawal of goods from customs.
This tax will be paid in a one-time and definitive payment.
### Source
Income from activities carried out with assets or rights used financially within the Republic by individuals, legal entities, and other non-resident entities shall be considered to have a Paraguayan source. In addition, revenues from Paraguayan sources are considered to be:

# Paraguay
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Inventory valuation
Taxpayers may adopt any method of inventory valuation, provided it is technically acceptable according to tax administration criteria (e.g. first in first out [FIFO], average cost). The valuation must be applied consistently and may be changed only with the prior approval of the Treasury Ministry.
Damaged, deteriorated, and obsolete inventories may be written down to fixed values by the taxpayer. The tax administration can reject valuations that are not realistic.
## Capital gains
Gains on all assets, tangible and intangible, are taxable as part of profits and subject to income tax at a rate of 10%. Foreign currency exchange gains are also taxable at the same tax rate.
## Dividend income
The profits, dividends, or returns made available or paid to the owner, partners, or shareholders by any kind of companies or private entities of a similar nature with legal personality, constituted in the country, as well as the PEs of entities incorporated abroad, will be taxed by the Tax on Dividends and Profits (IDU).
Dividends are taxable income when the recipient (or shareholder) is a non-resident, in which case a 15% withholding tax (WHT) applies. An 8% WHT applies to Paraguayan residents.
### Stock dividends
For the purposes of this tax, the additional benefits received by the worker in relation to the dependency that came from the net income of its company employer will not be considered dividends, profits, or distributed income, in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 285 / 1993 'That regulates article 93 of the National Constitution', as well as participation vouchers in favour of the company's personnel, in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 1,183 / 1985 'Civil Code', non-transferable and while it lasts the employment relationship.
The reduction or redemption of capital effectively contributed, carried out through the withdrawal of funds or assets, will also not constitute distribution of profits, dividends, or yields.
## Interest income
Interest income of a Paraguayan resident from capital abroad is subject to income tax at a rate 10% according to IRE regulations.
In no case, may loans or placements accrue interest at rates lower than the average of the deposit rates of the banking and financial market, applicable to placements of similar characteristics for the same instrument and term, in accordance with the publication of the average rates issued from the Central Bank of Paraguay, at the time of grant. Excluded from this provision are advanced salaries to personnel and loans or placements made by entities included in Laws No. s. 438/1994 and 861/1996.
## Royalty income
It should be highlighted that the criterion to determine the source of royalties’ income is the place where the rights are used, based on the terms agreed between the parties. Thus, in case of royalties' income from a registered trademark abroad where the use of it is in Paraguay, the royalties' income would be taxable. In this case, if the owner of the trademark is a non-resident in Paraguay, they will be subject to the non-resident tax at the rate of 15% on the amount of the payment.
However, royalties’ income of a local taxpayer paid by a foreign entity would not be subject to tax in Paraguay as long as the goods commercialised are being sold abroad, in which case this income is considered as foreign-source income.
## Foreign income
Foreign-source income is not taxable. However, interest, commissions, and capital gains are considered Paraguayan-source income and subject to IRE when the investor is resident in Paraguay.
The Tax Reform has increased the territoriality principle, and incomes from Paraguayan sources shall constitute income that comes from activities carried out in Paraguay from goods located or from rights used economically therein. In addition, income from Paraguayan sources will be considered those coming from:
Likewise, income from Paraguayan sources will be considered those obtained by carrying out activities abroad not included in the preceding paragraphs by the taxpayers of this tax, unless the taxpayer has paid an income tax abroad for them, whatever its denomination, at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of this tax. For this purpose and in order to avoid international double taxation, the provisions of Article 134 of this Law will be applied, and the tax administration will establish the requirements and the procedure for the payment demonstration.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Corporate legal residence is determined as the place where direction or central management takes place, unless the corporation’s charter states otherwise.
The Tax Reform establishes the residence definition in Art. 5: Residence of Legal Persons or Legal Structures.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Paraguayan Tax Law establishes the definition of a PE.
The following activities may be considered as a PE in the country:
If a person provides instructions related to the agreement of certain operations on behalf of a foreign entity, this operation may be considered as a PE in the country, except in cases where the mentioned instructions are related to the purchase of goods.

# Paraguay
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
For tax purposes, the determination of the residual value of the fixed assets, as well as their depreciation, is mandatory. The residual value of a fixed asset will be the estimated amount that the taxpayer could obtain from the disposal of an asset to the end of its useful life, after deducting the costs expected at that time.
The regulations will establish the estimates of useful life for each type or class of depreciable asset for the purpose of determining the depreciation admitted for the settlement of the tax, as well as the residual value for each type or class of depreciable fixed asset, which may not exceed 20% of its cost value.
The Executive Power may establish the mandatory revaluation of fixed assets when the variation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) determined by the Central Bank of Paraguay reaches at least 20%, accumulated since the fiscal year in which it is has arranged the last revaluation adjustment. The recognition of the mandatory revaluation established by the Executive Power will form part of a patrimonial reserve whose only destination may be capitalisation.
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not deductible.
## Start-up expenses
The Tax Reform establishes that incorporation and organisation expenses, including so-called pre-operational expenses and those of reorganisation due to acquisition, merger, spin-off, business model changes, or brand changes, may be amortised over a period of up to five years at the option of the taxpayer.
## Interest expenses
The interest expenses on loans taken for Paraguayan residents or Paraguayan taxpayers may be considered as deductible expenses.
Additionally, it is important to mention that certain investment projects may be subject to a special exemption of the taxes on the interest, commission, and other expenses for loans taken for banking entities abroad (*see Investment incentives in the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
However, the Tax Reform has introduced a limit if the loan is provided by a shareholder or related entities. Interests cannot be higher than the average nominal deposit rates established by the Central Bank of Paraguay. On the other hand, the deduction of expenses with related entities is limited, so if the financing is granted by a related entity, up to 30% of the net income for the year is allowed to be deducted.
## Extraordinary losses/bad debts
The deduction of extraordinary losses (theft and damage) and bad debts require the meeting of certain conditions (e.g. communication to the tax authority, evaluation of the actual loss in monetary terms, audit review). Regarding bad debts, they can be deductible three years from the date from which they arise as well as if other conditions are met, such as bankruptcy, inhibition of selling, and taxing of the debtor as established in the regulations.
## Charitable contributions
The deduction of a donation is subject to formal registration of the beneficiary entity as a public benefactor before the Treasury Ministry.
Donations to the state, municipalities, the Catholic Church, and other religious entities recognised by the competent authorities, as well as entities with legal status for health, social, education, culture, and charity that were previously recognised as a public benefit entity by the tax administration, could be deductible if the amount of the contributions are not higher than 1% of the annual gross income.
## Executive remuneration
The deduction of executive remuneration is limited to a percentage defined according to the enterprise's profits (1% of the annual gross income). However, in the event that the executive employees are subject to personal income tax (PIT), the deduction of their salaries is not limited for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are considered as non-deductible expenses for income tax purposes.
## Taxes
## Other significant items
General provisions for expenses or other potential losses are not deductible.
Other specific non-deductible items include:
## Net operating losses
Once the admitted deductions have been made, if the net income is negative, this tax loss may be offset with the net income of the next few years up to a maximum of five, counted consecutively and uninterruptedly from the following fiscal year in which it occurred. Losses from previous years may be offset annually up to the amount that represents 20% of the net income of future fiscal years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are limits and specific conditions on the deduction of payments to foreign affiliates, shareholders, or related parties. The amount of the payments must be at market value, and the deductions are limited to 30% of the net income of the year.

Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Paraguay.
## Transfer pricing
On 25 September 2019, the Paraguayan government issued Law 6380/2019 of Modernisation and Simplification of the National Tax System on Fiscal Reform. Such law includes important changes, such as the transfer pricing rules.
In this sense, in December 2020, the Paraguayan government issued Decree 4644/2020, which regulates the implementation of the transfer pricing rules provided by Law 6380/2019.
The transfer pricing rules entered into full force on 1 January 2021, except for the exportation of certain commodities, which will be subject to these rules from 1 July 2021 and will apply to companies carrying out inter-company transactions with both domestic and foreign related parties.
### Arm’s-length principle
The transfer pricing provision in Article 35 of Law 6380/2019 established that IRE payers that perform inter-company transactions with both foreign and domestic related parties are obligated to determine their income and deductions, taking into account prices that would have been used in or with comparable third parties transactions, in similar conditions.
Domestic inter-company transactions will be subject to transfer pricing analysis when one of the parties is exonerated, exempt, or not subject to IRE.
### Related parties assumptions
As mentioned above, the transfer pricing law applies to companies who carried out inter-company transaction with Paraguayan and foreign related parties according to Article 37 of Law 6380/2019.
Article 37 of Law 6380/2019 establishes that two or more persons are related parties when a person or group of people participates directly or indirectly in:
The Paraguayan transfer pricing provisions also establish that transactions carried out between a domestic party and a party located in countries or jurisdictions with low or null taxation regimes, maquila entities, or Free Trade Zones users are deemed to be related parties.
### Obligation to submit a transfer pricing study
Article 27 establishes that taxpayers must submit a transfer pricing study to the tax authority when their gross income in the previous fiscal year is greater than PYG 10 billion. Taxpayers who perform transactions with parties located in countries or jurisdictions with low or null taxation regimes, maquila entities, or Free Trade Zones users must submit a transfer pricing study regardless of the amount of their gross income.
According to Article 39 of Law 6380/2019, the transfer pricing study must include, among others:
Article 37 of Decree 4644/2020 establishes that the transfer pricing study must also include the following information:
The tax authority will establish the documents, the information, deadlines, and conditions for the presentation of the transfer pricing study.
### Comparability analysis and use of inter-quartile range
In order to use a comparable transaction to analyse a controlled transaction, this one must be carried out in the same fiscal year as the analysed transaction.
Nonetheless, in cases where there is no comparable information for the fiscal year, where the transaction was carried out, previous or future years’ information can be used, but justifications shall be presented.
If there are internal and external comparable, the taxpayer must prioritise the internal comparable in the analysis or, if not, justify its non-use.
Transfer pricing regulation specifies, where two or more comparable transactions are identified, the statistical method to be applied will be the inter-quartile range.
If the price, amount, or profit margin set by the taxpayer is within the inter-quartile range, it will be considered arm’s length; otherwise, the value of the transactions between independent parties must be the median of the range if this affects the taxable base.
### Transfer pricing methods
Article 38 of Law 6380/2019 describes each of the seven methods (seventh method must be used for export of commodities) to determine the value of a commercial and/or financial transaction carried out with related parties as follows:
1. Comparable uncontrolled price.
2. Resale price method.
3. Cost plus method.
4. Profit split method.
5. Residual profit split method.
6. Transactional net margin method.
7. Export of commodities.
The seventh method must be used for export commodities, such as soy or soy products, corn, rice, and wheat.
### Intra-group services
In the case of intra-group services transactions, before proceeding to the analysis of compliance with the arm’s-length principle, one must consider if the service was actually provided, if the services provide benefits that improve the recipient’s business, and if the paid price for the service is consistent to the arm’s length for comparable services.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions in Paraguay for CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Branches are taxed at the same rate as domestic corporations. Profits transferred or credited to the head office are subject to Dividends and Utilities Distribution Tax, and the tax rate is 15% if the head office is not resident and 8% if the head office is resident in Paraguay. The mentioned tax is withholding by the Paraguayan entity paying the dividends.

# Paraguay
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign tax credits are not applied to local tax payments in Paraguay.
## Investment incentives
The framework of economic investment was established in the Law No. 60/90, which offers some special tax exemption benefits to foreign and local investors.
The benefits of the Law No. 60/90 may be available for the following investments:
The investment incentives included in Law No. 60/90 that remain enacted after tax law modification (Law No. 2421/04) are the exemptions from certain fiscal, municipal, and customs duties taxes.
When the amount of financing for an investment is equal to or greater than USD 5 million, it will be exempt from WHTs on interest, commissions, and capital that have to be paid to financial or banking entities abroad. This benefit is for five years.
If the investment is at least USD 5 million and the project is approved by the tax authorities, the dividends and profits derived from the project are tax exempt. The mentioned exemption is granted for five years and may be extended to ten years.
## *Maquila* tax exemptions (Law No. 1064/97)
Innovative regulations allow for virtual commerce between *maquila* factories, which improve the utilisation of goods imported under the temporary regime (called ‘virtual *maquila*’).
Paraguayan legislation does not impose restrictions in terms of the types of products and services that the *maquila* industry may comprise. The *maquila* activity’s national policy is regulated and supervised by the National Council of the *Maquila* Industry for Export (CNIME). Both individuals and legal entities domiciled in Paraguay, whether national or foreign, may take advantage of these regulatory benefits.
## Free trade zones (called '*zona franca*' Law No. 523/95)
Free trade zones, where all types of commercial, industrial, and service activities may be carried out, constitute a relevant incentive for business.
The legal framework governing such zones offer several advantages in terms of tax exemptions, as well as a special tax regime with an income tax rate of 0.5%.
The main purpose of free trade zones is the development of activities in connection with foreign markets; however, operations within the country are also allowed.
Law No. 523/95, ‘which authorises and establishes the Free Trade Zone Regime’, and its regulatory Decree No. 15,554/96, ‘which regulates the Free Trade Zone Law’, among others, establish the guidelines related to activities within free trade zones.
The aforementioned regulation establishes two main entities, the ‘concessionaire’, responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure for freight operational management, and the user, responsible for carrying out the commercial, industrial, or service activity. The regulation therefore establishes the administrative measures that enable operations in free trade zones and its supervision, control, and development.
There are currently two free trade zones located in the Alto Paraná region (northeastern region, in close proximity to the border with Brazil and Argentina), in which national and international companies actively operate.
