# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Taxable business profits are determined on the basis of net profit for financial accounting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), subject to certain modifications in the Tax and Duties Act (TDA). In general, income is assessable when 'receivable', while expenses are deductible when 'payable'. A taxpayer with turnover of less than USD 100,000 may, however, elect to pay tax on a cash basis.
Gross income is defined widely to mean “any realised increase in economic capacity in whatever name or form which can be used for consumption or to increase the wealth of the taxpayer other than wages that are subject to Wages Income Tax (WIT)".
The gross income for a tax year is the total amount earned by the taxpayer, including, but not limited to, business income, property income, lottery prizes or awards, and refunds of tax payments previously deducted as an expense.
## Inventory valuation
There are no specific provisions dealing with inventory valuation in Timor-Leste. This is because a deduction is allowed for the cost of inventory incurred during the tax year even if the inventory is on hand at the end of the year.
## Capital gains
Gains and losses arising from the alienation of assets are generally assessable and deductible as ordinary income and subject to tax at the standard CIT rate.
## Dividend income
Dividends are tax exempt in the hands of Timor-Leste residents.
## Interest income
Interest income is generally assessable as ordinary income and subject to tax at the standard CIT rate.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to a 10% WHT.
If the royalty payment is to a resident non-individual, the WHT is creditable for income tax purposes.
If the royalty payment is to an individual, the 10% WHT constitutes a final income tax.
## Exempted income
The following income is tax exempt:
## Foreign income
Under the worldwide income principle, a resident taxpayer is required to calculate income that is not only Timor-Leste sourced but also foreign sourced. In the case that the foreign-sourced income is taxed at source, Timor-Leste allows a foreign tax credit for the particular tax year (*see Foreign tax credit in the [Tax credits and incentives](timor-leste/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
With regard to profits retained in controlled foreign companies (CFCs), Timor-Leste does not currently have any arrangements to otherwise deem the repatriation of the profit.

# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
WHT is imposed on the following payments by residents to a resident:
| Type of payment | WHT rate (%) | Final/non-final tax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | 0 | Final |
| Interest | 0 | Not final |
| Royalties | 10 | Not final, except where paid to an individual |
| Rent (land and building) | 10 | Not final, except where paid to an individual |
| Prize and winnings | 10 | Final |
| Construction/building activities | 2 | Final \* |
| Construction consulting services | 4 | Final \* |
| Air and sea transportation | 2.64 | Final \* |
\* The default position is that such amounts will be a final tax. The income recipient can elect to have these payments for services not subjected to final tax by submitting a notification letter to the Timor-Leste Revenue Service.
Payments of Timor-Leste-source income made by a resident to a non-resident are subject to WHT at 10%. Timor-Leste has entered into a double taxation treaty (DTT) with Portugal (although elements of DTT relief are also embedded in the Timor Sea Treaty [TST], *see Taxation of petroleum operations in the [Other issues](timor-leste/corporate/other-issues.html) section*).
Where WHT is applied as a final tax, the taxed income is not included in the recipients’ taxable income for income tax purposes. Accordingly, expenses incurred in deriving income that is subject to final tax are not deductible for income tax purposes.

# Timor-Leste
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Timor-Leste residents are taxable on a worldwide income basis, while non-residents are taxable only on the income sourced from Timor-Leste. Residents earning foreign-sourced income may receive a foreign tax credit (*see the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](timor-leste/individual/foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section*).
Timor-Leste individual taxpayers are subject to income tax on their taxable income, which is essentially the difference between gross income (other than from employment, *see Wage Income Tax [WIT] below*) and allowable deductions.
## Personal income tax rates
The income tax rates applicable for a resident individual taxpayer are as follows:
| Annual taxable income (USD\*) | | Income tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 6,000 | 0 |
| 6,000 |  | 10 |
\* United States dollars
The income tax rate for taxable income earned by a non-resident individual is 10% (flat rate) for all Timor-Leste sourced taxable income.
## Wage Income Tax (WIT)
WIT is imposed on taxable wages received by an employee in Timor-Leste who is in employment in Timor-Leste. Employment in Timor-Leste is described as services performed in Timor-Leste or performed by an employee of the government of Timor-Leste, irrespective of where the services take place.
The WIT rates are as follows:
| Annual taxable income (USD) | | WIT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 500 | 0 |
| 500 |  | 10 |
Wages paid to employees who are non-residents of Timor-Leste are taxed at a flat rate of 10% (i.e. with no tax-free threshold). Wages are taxable whether provided in a cash or non-cash form.
Wages exempt from WIT are as follows:
An employer paying taxable wages shall withhold WIT from those wages, using the tax rates as provided, and remit the WIT on a monthly basis.
If an employee receives wages that have been correctly subject to WIT, then no further WIT or income tax liability exists with respect to those wages.
An annual WIT return is due by the last day of March of the following the end of the relevant tax year. Information on WIT withheld must also be provided to each employee on an annual basis or on termination of employment.

| Tobacco and tobacco products | USD 100.00/kg |
| Cigarette lighters | 12% of the excise value |
| Smoking pipes | 12% of the excise value |
| Arms and ammunition | 200% of the excise value |
| Motor cars and small passenger vehicles (with an excise value exceeding USD 50,000) | 30% of the excise value |
| Private boats and aircraft | 20% of the excise value |
Note that the excise value of excisable goods imported into Timor-Leste is the total of the customs value and any import duty imposed. The excise value of excisable goods manufactured in Timor-Leste is their fair market value at the time of removal from the manufacturer's warehouse.
Goods on the above list are excisable goods, other than:
## Property taxes
There are no taxes on property in Timor-Leste.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Timor-Leste.
## Stamp duties
There is no stamp duty in Timor-Leste.
## Payroll taxes
An employer paying taxable wages shall withhold Wage Income Tax (WIT) at a rate of 10% from those wages and remit the WIT on a monthly basis.
An annual WIT return is due by the last day of the March following the end of the relevant tax year. Information on WIT withheld must also be provided to each employee on an annual basis or on termination of employment.
## Social security contributions
A Social Security scheme was introduced in November 2016, with both employers and employees required to make contributions. The scheme provides cover for loss of income/benefits due to work-related accidents, maternity, old age, and death. It would appear that Social Security contributions should be deductible to employers. Implementing regulations for this scheme should be closely monitored.

# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
The income of companies is generally subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at a flat rate of 10%.
## Industry-specific CIT rates
The rate of CIT for oil and gas contractors is 30%, while sub-contractors are subject to CIT at the flat rate of (generally) 6%.
Supplemental Petroleum Tax (SPT) also applies for oil and gas contractors and is imposed on 'accumulated net receipts' using a specific formula. SPT is deductible for CIT calculation purposes.
Separate tax arrangements apply for petroleum activities in the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) (*see the [Other issues](timor-leste/corporate/other-issues.html) section*).
## Local income taxes
There are no municipal or local taxes on income in Timor-Leste.

The definition of a corporate resident (resident legal person) covers a wide range of entities, such as companies, partnerships, trusts, governmental institutions, and unincorporated associations incorporated, formed, organised, or established in Timor-Leste.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is defined as a fixed place of business through which the business of a person is wholly or partly carried on, including:

# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
The taxable income of residents and non-residents who have a PE in Timor-Leste shall be determined on the basis of gross income reduced by:
## Depreciation and amortisation
'Depreciable assets' include any tangible movable property with a useful life exceeding one year that is wholly or partly used for taxable business activities. 'Intangible assets' include property, other than tangible movable property or immovable property, with a useful life exceeding one year that is used for taxable business activities.
There are provisions for election of either straight-line or double-declining methods, the pooling of assets, and *de minimis* exceptions. However, the rate of tax depreciation/amortisation (for non-petroleum operations) is set at 100%, meaning that taxpayers are, in effect, entitled to a full and up-front deduction. In circumstances where the asset is only partly used for the conduct of taxable business activities, the deduction is reduced by the proportion of its non-taxable business use.
## Goodwill
There are no specific provisions dealing with the treatment of goodwill. We expect that the treatment should follow that under IFRS.
## Start-up expenses
There are no specific provisions dealing with the treatment of start-up expenses. However, assuming that the start-up expense is incurred to derive income, we expect that start-up expense should be deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenditure is not deductible unless incurred by a financial institution.
## Bad debts
Bad debts are not deductible without passing all of the following tests:
The above tests do not apply to banks, which are entitled to deduct provisions for doubtful debt where determined in accordance with the prudential requirements prescribed by instruction of the Banking and Payments Authority.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are not deductible if the donations are exempt from income tax in the hands of the recipient.
## Fines and penalties
Penalties for violation of law and regulation are not deductible.
## Taxes
Timor-Leste or foreign income tax is not deductible.
## Deductions not allowed or conditional deductions
The following expenses are also not deductible to a resident or non-resident with a PE in Timor-Leste:
## Net operating losses
Losses from previous years may be carried forward indefinitely. However, the carried forward loss from the disposal of assets may only be utilised against gains arising from the disposal of assets. Foreign-sourced losses may only be offset against foreign-sourced income of that particular country.
The carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Excessive payments or compensation to ‘members of a legal person’ or payments between associates for work performed should not be deductible. The TDA, however, does not elaborate on the meaning of ‘excessive’.

# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
Companies, etc. are taxable on a stand-alone basis (i.e. there is no grouping or ability to transfer tax losses).
## Transfer pricing
Excessive payments or compensation to ‘members of a legal person’ or payments between associates for work performed should not be deductible. The TDA, however, does not provide specific guidance on how to determine arm’s-length pricing on related-party transactions or any other general transfer pricing principles.
## Thin capitalisation
Currently, there are no ‘thin capitalisation’ or similar rules in Timor-Leste (noting that interest is not deductible, except for financial institutions).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Timor-Leste does not have any CFC regulations.

## Taxation of petroleum operations
The taxation of petroleum operations in Timor-Leste is partly covered by the TDA. However, the TDA operates only to modify the taxation of petroleum activities pursuant to a number of legacy tax regimes. These modifications apply to contractors, sub-contractors, and any other parties receiving income from the supply of goods or services to a contractor or sub-contractor.
A contractor is defined as a person with whom the responsible Ministry or Designated Authority, as the case may be, has made a petroleum agreement. A sub-contractor includes any person supplying goods or services directly or indirectly to a contractor in respect of petroleum operations.
Specific provisions for the taxation of petroleum operations include:

## Taxation of petroleum operations
The taxation of petroleum operations in Timor-Leste is partly covered by the TDA. However, the TDA operates only to modify the taxation of petroleum activities pursuant to a number of legacy tax regimes. These modifications apply to contractors, sub-contractors, and any other parties receiving income from the supply of goods or services to a contractor or sub-contractor.
Specific provisions for the taxation of petroleum operations include a personal income tax (PIT) rate of 30% for residents or 20% for non-residents.
## Special tax regime within certain maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
## Employment income
### Equity compensation
There are no special rules at present for equity compensation.
## Business income
Taxable business profits are determined on the basis of net profits for financial accounting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), subject to certain modifications in the TDA. In general, income is assessable when 'receivable', while expenses are deductible when 'payable'. A taxpayer with turnover of less than USD 100,000 may, however, elect to pay tax on a cash basis.
Gross income is defined widely to mean ’any realised increase in economic capacity in whatever name or form which can be used for consumption or to increase the wealth of the taxpayer other than wages that are subject to WIT’.
The gross income for a tax year is the total amount earned by the taxpayer, including, but not limited to, business income, property income, lottery prizes or awards, and refunds of tax payments previously deducted as an expense.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as business income.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is tax exempt (*see Exempt income below*).
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as business income.
## Rental income
An individual paying rent is not required to withhold tax. Instead, the rental payment recipient is required to 'withhold' tax at 10% from the gross amount received.
## Exempt income
The following income is tax exempt:
