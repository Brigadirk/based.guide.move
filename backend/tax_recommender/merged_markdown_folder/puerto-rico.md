## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Social security contributions
## Consumption taxes
### Sales and use tax (SUT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Puerto Rico does not have a net wealth/worth tax.
## Property taxes
The property tax system is administered by the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (MRCC). The tax on real property is directly assessed by the MRCC and may be paid in two instalments. The tax, which varies depending on the municipality, is applied to an amount based on the hypothetical fair market value (FMV) of the relevant property in the year 1957. In general terms, this hypothetical FMV normally ranges between 40% and 50% of the cost of the property.
## Luxury and excise taxes
## Payroll taxes
Puerto Rico employers are required to withhold from their employees certain payroll taxes in addition to the withholding for income tax. These payroll taxes are: Social Security and Medicare taxes, disability benefits tax, and chauffeur's and other employees' employment security tax. There are also payroll taxes only borne by the employer and should not be deducted from the employee's wages, such as: unemployment insurance tax (Puerto Rico and Federal) and workmen's accident compensation insurance tax.
All payroll taxes are required for Puerto Rican resident individuals. However, some payroll taxes may also be required for Puerto Rican non-resident US citizen or foreign national individuals.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
The gross income of a corporation generally includes business income, profits from the sale of property, interest, dividends, and income derived from any source, unless specifically exempted by law.
A corporation’s net income is generally calculated in accordance with the method used for financial statement purposes, except for various items of income and expenses, which are treated differently. For example, the cash method of accounting may not be used by a corporation with inventory or with an average annual gross income in excess of USD 1 million. Long-term contract methods and the instalment method can be used for regular tax calculations.
## Inventory valuation
In general, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Retail merchants can use the retail method of accounting.
## Capital gains
Tax-advantaged treatment is provided for net long-term gains (holding period of more than one year) from the sale of capital assets. For corporations, net long-term capital gains, reduced by any short-term capital losses, are subject to an alternative (preferential) tax of 20% in lieu of the regular CIT rates.
## Dividend income
Dividends from a corporation that derives 20% or more of its profits from sources within Puerto Rico are taxable in Puerto Rico. However, a dividends-received deduction may apply.
### Dividends-received deduction
All corporations engaged in trade or business in Puerto Rico are entitled to an 85% deduction on dividends received from a domestic corporation but not in excess of 85% of the net income of the corporation. A 100% dividends-received deduction applies for dividends received from taxable controlled domestic corporations (if ownership in a corporation is 80% or more).
## Interest income
## Royalty income
Royalties from property located in Puerto Rico or from any interest in such property are included in gross income.
## Pass-through income
The income (loss) of a pass-through entity flows through to its owners so that the entity itself is not subject to tax. Thus, each owner generally accounts for their distributive share of the entity's taxable income (loss).
Also, sourcing rules were amended by Act 257 to provide that the sale of the interests of a pass-through entity that is engaged in a Puerto Rico trade or business will be Puerto Rico-source income in the same proportion as if the entity had sold all of its assets at their fair market value as of the date of the sale of such interest, regardless of the residence of the selling partner(s).
If the selling owner is a non-resident individual or foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business in Puerto Rico, the seller will be subject to a 15% income tax withholding on the amount of the gain that constitutes Puerto Rico-source income.
## Other income
Service fees are generally taxable as ordinary income.
## Foreign income
Generally, a Puerto Rico domestic corporation is taxed on its worldwide income, including foreign income earned and foreign dividends when received. Double taxation is avoided by means of foreign tax credit or deduction. In the case of resident foreign corporations, these are only taxed on their PR-source income and on their effectively connected Puerto Rico income. Generally, foreign income will not be taxable for Puerto Rico purposes. However, Act 257 provided a change in sourcing rule for revenue earned on contracts with the Puerto Rico government. Broadly, the statute states that income generated on such contracts will be deemed Puerto Rico-source income irrespective of where the service was provided, if the contract is not registered with the Office of the Comptroller in Puerto Rico.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
Corporations not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico are subject to a 29% WHT at source on certain gross income items (considered fixed or determinable, annual or periodical [FDAP]) from Puerto Rico sources.
FDAP income may include interest received from a related person, rents, royalties, salaries, annuities, compensation, remuneration, and net capital gains. However, if the payment received is from dividends, a 10% WHT should apply.
The payer, as a withholding agent, is responsible for the withholding and remittance of the 29% (10% in the case of dividends) to the PRTD. Such tax is due on or before the 15th day of the month following the receipt of the income by the non-resident corporation. An annual informative return is also required to be filed no later than 15 April of the following year.
## Tax treaties
There are no tax treaties between foreign countries and Puerto Rico.

# Puerto Rico
## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
Puerto Rico, located in the Caribbean Sea, is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands. The capital of Puerto Rico is San Juan, the official languages are English and Spanish, and the currency is the United States dollar (USD).
Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth of the United States. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal self-government.
Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has far surpassed agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty-free access to the United States and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income, with estimated arrivals of more than 5.2 million tourists in 2017.

# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Taxable period
The tax year in Puerto Rico is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
In most cases, taxpayers must file an individual income tax return on a calendar-year basis by 15 April of the following year. Filing of returns, availability of deductions, and applicability of tax rates depends on residency and US citizenship.
An automatic extension of time to file is granted (upon request) if submitted by 15 April. This extension is for six months.
The following three categories of filing status are available for taxpayers:
For tax years after 31 December 2018, the obligation to file a Puerto Rico income tax return will be triggered when gross income minus the exemptions allowed under the Code is more than USD 0, unless the total income tax was withheld at source. Taxpayers are also required to file a tax return if the net income subject to ABT is USD 25,000 or more.
## Payment of tax
Puerto Rico follows a 'pay as you go' withholding mechanism to fund income taxes on compensation throughout the year. For Puerto Rican residents, the employer will compute the income tax withholding for each employee based on the information provided by the employee on a specific form and with tables or percentage methods provided by the PR Treasury Department.
Puerto Rican employees who are non-residents are subject to a flat 29% withholding in the case of foreign nationals and to a 20% withholding in the case of US citizens.
In the case of a Puerto Rican resident who provides services (rather than as an employee) to another resident person, the income earned while providing such services will be subject to a withholding flat rate of 10%. Such withholding tax (WHT) rate does not apply to the first USD 500 of income earned by the individual who provides the services.
Puerto Rican resident taxpayers with income not subject to withholding (e.g. self-employment income, capital gains, rent) must generally make quarterly payments of estimated tax due 15 April, 15 June, 15 September, and 15 January. If the taxpayer's balance due will be at least USD 1,000, the taxpayer will be subject to the payment of quarterly payments of estimated tax. Any balance of tax owed is due 15 April of the following year.
## Foreign bank account report
Act No. 52 of 2022, enacted 30 June 2022, introduced to PR tax laws the requirement for individual PR residents to report information regarding financial accounts maintained outside Puerto Rico or the United States in which they have a financial interest and whose maximum value during the tax year exceeded USD 10,000.
Foreign financial accounts can be bank accounts, broker accounts, future or options contract accounts, crypto asset accounts, cash value insurance accounts, investment accounts, or any other account where funds are held outside Puerto Rico or the United States. An individual is considered as having a financial interest in an account when: they are the owner, the owner is a third party acting on behalf of the individual, the owner is an entity in which the individual directly or indirectly owns at least 50% of all their value or voting power, the owner is a grantor trust for the individual’s benefit, or the individual has signature authority over the assets.
An individual that does not comply with foreign financial accounts reporting provisions will incur a penalty of USD 10,000 per report. The Secretary may publish regulations or communications to consider individuals in compliance with these provisions through the filing of the federal foreign financial accounts reports, Form 8938, and FinCEN Form 114.

# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
Puerto Rican residents are taxed in Puerto Rico on their worldwide income, no matter where the income is sourced. Puerto Rican non-residents are only taxed in Puerto Rico on their Puerto Rico-source income. Income for services performed is sourced to Puerto Rico based on where the services are performed. Such income is typically prorated to Puerto Rico based on workdays.
Puerto Rico has a *de minimis* rule to avoid sourcing to Puerto Rico very small amounts of income from personal services. Income from personal services performed within Puerto Rico will not be considered from Puerto Rican sources if it is 3,000 United States dollars (USD) or less and the individual was present in Puerto Rico for 90 days or less during the calendar year (such personal services must have been provided to an employer who is not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico).
## Personal income tax rates
The following regular tax rates remain in effect for 2018 and future years:
| Net taxable income (USD) | Tax |
| --- | --- |
| Not over 9,000 | 0% |
| Over 9,000, but not over 25,000 | 7% of the excess over USD 9,000 |
| Over 25,000, but not over 41,500 | USD 1,120 plus 14% of the excess over USD 25,000 |
| Over 41,500, but not over 61,500 | USD 3,430 plus 25% of the excess over USD 41,500 |
| Over 61,500 | USD 8,430 plus 33% of the excess over USD 61,500 |
## Gradual adjustment tax
If the individual's net taxable income exceeds USD 500,000, they will have to pay an additional tax (i.e. gradual adjustment tax). This tax is 5% of the excess of the total net taxable income over USD 500,000, limited to 33% of their personal and dependents' exemption plus USD 8,895.
## Alternate basic tax (ABT)
In addition to the regular income tax, individuals are required to compute an ABT assessed in accordance to the below tax table. The ABT taxable income is computed by adding back certain income items exempt from regular income tax.
### ABT rates:
| Net income subject to ABT (USD) | Tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| In excess of 25,000 but not more than 50,000 | 1 |
| In excess of 50,000 but not more than 75,000 | 3 |
| In excess of 75,000 but not more than 150,000 | 5 |
| In excess of 150,000 but not more than 250,000 | 10 |
| In excess of 250,000 | 24 |
The credit for prior years’ ABT liability may not be sold, transferred, or refunded. When determining the net income subject to ABT, this credit will be reduced by the portion of the ABT attributable to non-deductible expenses.
The ABT will not be applicable to individuals whose only source of income is from salaries informed in a Withholding Statement.
For tax years after 31 December 2019, an individual's total tax will be 95% of one's total tax determined (regular tax plus gradual adjustment) if gross income exceeds USD 100,000. If gross income is USD 100,000 or less, then the individuals total tax will be 92% of one's total tax determined.
### New optional tax for self-employed individuals rendering services
Self-employed individuals whose income is derived substantially from the business of rendering services may elect to pay an optional tax on gross income instead of the income tax otherwise imposed by the Code on net income, as follows:
| Gross income (USD) | Tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Not greater than 100,000 | 6 |
| In excess of 100,000 but not more than 200,000 | 10 |
| In excess of 200,000 but not more than 300,000 | 13 |
| In excess of 300,000 but not more than 400,000 | 15 |
| In excess of 400,000 but not more than 500,000 | 17 |
| In excess of 500,000 | 20 |
The income received must be substantially from the provision of services. For these purposes, accrued income will be considered to come substantially from services rendered when said income category represents at least 80% of the total gross income received during the taxable year.
In addition, to use the optional computation of tax, the total gross self-employment income must be subject to withholding at source or to estimated tax payments and must be reported in an Informative Return.
The new optional tax is applicable for taxable years that commence after 31 December 2018.

## Social security contributions
## Consumption taxes
### Sales and use tax (SUT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Puerto Rico does not have a net wealth/worth tax.
## Property taxes
The property tax system is administered by the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (MRCC). The tax on real property is directly assessed by the MRCC and may be paid in two instalments. The tax, which varies depending on the municipality, is applied to an amount based on the hypothetical fair market value (FMV) of the relevant property in the year 1957. In general terms, this hypothetical FMV normally ranges between 40% and 50% of the cost of the property.
## Luxury and excise taxes
## Payroll taxes
Puerto Rico employers are required to withhold from their employees certain payroll taxes in addition to the withholding for income tax. These payroll taxes are: Social Security and Medicare taxes, disability benefits tax, and chauffeur's and other employees' employment security tax. There are also payroll taxes only borne by the employer and should not be deducted from the employee's wages, such as: unemployment insurance tax (Puerto Rico and Federal) and workmen's accident compensation insurance tax.
All payroll taxes are required for Puerto Rican resident individuals. However, some payroll taxes may also be required for Puerto Rican non-resident US citizen or foreign national individuals.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Taxable period
The annual accounting period may be on the basis of the calendar year, a fiscal year ending on the last day of a month, or a 52/53 week year.
## Tax returns
The Puerto Rico tax system is based on the principle of self-assessment. A corporate taxpayer is required to file an annual income tax return by the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of its tax year. A taxpayer that is treated as a pass-through entity is required to file an annual income tax return by the 15th day of the third month following the close of its taxable year. A taxpayer that is an exempt business is required to file an annual income tax return by the 15th day of the sixth month following the close of its taxable year. In general terms, a taxpayer can obtain an automatic extension of six months to file its income tax return. Failure to timely file can result in penalties.
Taxpayers are also generally required to file a personal property tax return by 15 May and a volume of business declaration by the fifth business day after 15 April.
## Payment of tax
A corporation must substantially satisfy its annual income tax liability, if any, through estimated income tax payments. The amount of estimated income taxes should be paid on equal instalments on the 15th day of the fourth, sixth, ninth, and 12th month of the taxable year of the corporation. The estimated payments should equal or exceed 90% of the actual tax for the year (including AMT) or, in cases where a CIT return was filed by the corporation in the preceding year, 100% of such tax liability. Any tax not covered by the estimated tax payments should be paid along with the CIT return. Failure to pay the tax by the due dates indicated above may result in a penalty of 10% of the instalment due.
## Annual report
Every corporation is required to file an annual corporation report with the Puerto Rico Department of State. This annual report must be filed by the 15th day of April along with a USD 150 annual fee and a balance sheet as of the close of operations of the prior year. The report should be filed through the Puerto Rico Department of State's website. In the case of for-profit corporations, if the volume of business exceeds USD 3 million, the annual report must be accompanied by a balance sheet certified by a certified public accountant (CPA) licensed in Puerto Rico. In the event that the volume of business does not exceed USD 3 million, a balance sheet prepared under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) by a person with a general knowledge in accounting has to be submitted along with the corporate annual report. An extension of 60 days (an additional 30-day period may be requested) for filing the annual report can be obtained if timely requested. The Secretary of State is authorised to impose a penalty for failure to timely or accurately file the annual corporate report that would be between USD 75 and USD 2,000 if a non-profit corporation, and between USD 750 and USD 2,000 if a for-profit corporation.
## Audited financial statements
Accounting records must be prepared in accordance with the GAAP followed in the United States. For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2019, domestic (i.e. incorporated in Puerto Rico) or foreign corporations with volume of business of  USD 10 million or more must include, with their CIT return, audited financial statements of the Puerto Rico operations for the accounting year ended on or before the preceding 31 December. Taxpayers with volume of business of USD 3 million but less than USD 10 million must also include audited financial statements but can replace this requirement with an agreed-upon procedures report or a compliance attestation report. The financial statements should be submitted with an audit report issued by a CPA licensed in Puerto Rico. The agreed-upon procedures and compliance attestation report are also required to be issued by a CPA licensed in Puerto Rico.
All groups of related entities engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico are required to file consolidated or combined financial statements (CFS), which should contain a consolidating schedule and general information of the related parties. The determination of the gross income threshold for purposes of the audited financial statement requirement should be made taking into consideration the aggregated volume of business of all entities within the group of related entities. Entities may opt for stand-alone audited financial statements provided the general and financial information of all related entities engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico is included in the notes of the stand-alone financial statements.
For tax years started after December 31, 2019, entities with a volume of business of less than $3M that are part of a group of related entities with an aggregated volume of business of $10M, are not required to submit audited financial statements but may voluntary do so for the purposes of obtaining AMT deduction and/or withholding waiver benefits. Entities with a volume of business of $3M or more that are part of a group of related entities with an aggregated volume of business of $10M are required to submit audited financial statements.
The requirement for audited financial statements will not apply to non-profit organisations or disregarded entities. However, a disregarded entity’s volume of business is aggregated to the owner’s volume of business and the owner would be required to include the income and expenses of the disregarded entity in the owner's combined or consolidated financial statements. Also, qualified and disclaimer opinions are now allowed to the extent that the qualification or disclaimer does not result from a restriction in scope. However, no adverse opinions are allowed.
With respect to the filings for personal property, municipal license tax, and annual report, if audited financial statements were required or voluntarily submitted alongside the CIT return, they will also need to be submitted alongside the personal property tax return, municipal licenses return, and annual report.
Supplemental information is also required to be included as part of the audited financial statements to be filed with the income tax return, municipal license return, and personal property tax return. The due date for the supplemental information is the last day of the month following the CIT due date, including extensions. The supplemental information must be submitted electronically and separately from the audited financial statements.
For tax years started after 31 December 2022, supplemental information will not be required unless the taxpayer is a financial institution, a hospital unit, or a construction business with contracts exceeding USD 1 million.
## Tax audit process
Many taxpayers are under audit by the PRTD. The audits may include income, payroll, withholding, and sales and use taxes.
## Statute of limitations
The PRTD generally has four years after an original return is filed to assess income, payroll, and sales and use taxes. A return will be deemed to have been filed on the later of (i) its due date or (ii) the date the return was actually filed.
Currently, the PRTD focuses on issues of SUT, inter-company loans, withholding at source, and payments to foreign affiliates, among others.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Sales and use tax (SUT)
As a general rule, the SUT shall be applied, collected, and paid on all transactions of taxable items in Puerto Rico. Taxable items consist of tangible personal property, taxable services, admissions, digital products, and what is known as bundled transactions. Excluded from this definition are professional associations and certain membership fees; stamps issued by professional associations, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the federal government; human blood, tissue, and organs; maintenance fees paid to resident associations; air and maritime tickets; real property; and bingos, raffles, and lottery. Other transactions that are exempt from SUT include export transactions; duty-free stores located at airport or maritime ports; prescription medicines; insulin; taxable items acquired for certain manufacturing operations (e.g. raw materials); and food and ingredients for food (except for prepared food, diet supplements, sweets, and carbonated beverages), legal and consulting services rendered by authorised members of the bar.
The SUT rate is imposed at 10.5% at the state level and an additional 1% at the municipal level, for an aggregate 11.5%. Designated professional services and business-to-business (B2B) services are taxed at a 4% SUT rate.
Taxable services that are excluded from SUT include, among others, the following:
SUT should be remitted to the Puerto Rico government as 10.5% or 4% to the Puerto Rico Treasury Department (PRTD) and the remaining 1% to the corresponding municipality.
Tangible personal property introduced into Puerto Rico is subject to use tax upon importation, holding the release on the ports until the use tax is satisfied, unless the taxpayer is a bonded merchant or an eligible reseller. The use tax paid upon importation of the merchandise can be claimed as a credit on the SUT return.
Every natural or juridical person who does or wishes to do business of any kind in Puerto Rico shall request registration in the Merchant's Registry of the PRTD at least 30 days before starting operations. Once the registration application is filled out and approved, the Secretary of the Treasury will grant a Merchant's Registration Certificate. This certificate constitutes the merchant's authorisation to do business in Puerto Rico and confirms the merchant's obligation as a withholding agent. The Merchant's Registration Certificate shall be displayed, at all times, in a visible place for the general public in the commercial establishment for which it was issued. Please note that if a merchant is doing business in one or more of the 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico, the merchant only needs to register with the PRTD.
Unless specifically exempted, all persons selling taxable items are required to file a monthly SUT return. This return shall be filed electronically with the PRTD no later than the 20th day of the calendar month following the month during which the sales occurred. Also, all persons that import tangible property to Puerto Rico must file a use tax on imports return no later than the 20th day of the calendar month following the import.
There is a credit for purchases of products manufactured in Puerto Rico for purposes of SUT. In general, the credit will be 10% of the excess of the purchases of eligible products over the average of the purchases of eligible products for three out of ten prior taxable years. This credit can be carried forward until exhausted. It is important to note that the credit used will be considered taxable income for income tax purposes of the year the credit is taken.
Act No. 40 of 2020 introduced marketplace rules in Puerto Rico for SUT purposes. It also introduced the concept of specified digital products and how these would be taxed in Puerto Rico for SUT purposes. Act No. 52 of 2022 later retrieved the definition of specified digital products originally published in the regulations for PR-IRC Section 4010.01 and included it within the tax code as three different concepts: specified digital products, digital products, and other digital products.
## Customs duties and import tariffs
Puerto Rico does not have customs duty and import tariff provisions. Since Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth of the United States, it follows the United States' customs duties and import tariffs.
## Excise taxes
There are certain articles subject to a special excise tax, such as cigarettes, fuels, crude oils, vehicles, alcoholic beverages, cement, sugar, and plastic products, among others.
### Act No. 154's excise tax
Companies with manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico may be subject to an excise tax on goods or services provided to offshore-related entities under Act No. 154 of 2010, as amended. This Act created an excise tax that works in tandem with Act No. 154's source rules. Where the excise tax applies, it is in lieu of the tax that otherwise would arise from the application of Act No. 154's source rules. Under this excise tax rule, offshore purchasers that acquire goods from Puerto Rico sellers with gross receipts in excess of USD 75 million for any of the three preceding taxable years and that otherwise meet the source-of-income rule thresholds (set forth above) are subject to this excise tax equal to the ‘applicable percentage of the value’ of such personal property or services, which is essentially a scaled-back percentage. The excise tax rate is as follows:
Various tax credits are provided to offset the excise tax mentioned above.
The excise tax is collected by the Puerto Rico seller on receipts from the sale of personal property or services rendered to a related offshore purchaser. The tax has to be deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury on or before the 13th day of the month following the sale. Each person required to collect the excise tax must file a quarterly excise tax return on 30 April, 31 July, 31 October, and 1 January and pay any remaining tax liability not deposited on a monthly basis, as outlined above.
Act No. 154 sets forth the process for which a credit may be claimed for (i) taxes paid to any of the states of the United States on the acquisition of personal property and services and (ii) taxes paid to Puerto Rico by another member of the taxpayer’s controlled group on a series of purchases.
Act No. 52 of 2022 introduced an election for Puerto Rico resident entities that hold or apply for a tax grant under manufacturing tax incentives laws to be subject to a higher alternate fixed rate in exchange for an exemption of Act 154 sourcing rules, amongst other benefits.
## Personal property taxes
Every corporation engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico that on 1 January of each year owns personal property used in its trade or business within Puerto Rico, whether it is leased to another entity or not, is subject to tax on such property. The tax is self-assessed by the corporation, and it is paid together with the filing of an annual return. The tax ranges between 5.80% and 9.83%, depending on the municipality.
The tax return must be filed electronically through the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (MRCC) website ([*https://portal.crim360.com*](https://portal.crim360.com)). In order to file the return, every taxpayer with over USD 10 million in volume of business and specialist who had prepared more than five returns for the prior taxable year need to register using this website. The signature and certification of the return will be satisfied by virtue of the electronic filing. Also, all returns filed electronically should be accompanied by the corresponding payment due on or before 15 May.
Every corporation must substantially satisfy its personal property tax liability, if any, through estimated tax payments. The amount of estimated taxes should be paid in equal instalments on the 15th day of August, November, February, and May of the taxable year of the corporation. The estimated payments should equal or exceed 90% of the actual personal property tax for the year or 100% of the personal property tax as reflected in the personal property tax return for the preceding taxable year, whichever is less. Any tax not covered by the estimated tax payments should be paid along with the personal property tax return. Failure to pay the tax by the due dates indicated above may result in a penalty of 10% of the instalment due.
A 5% statutory discount is available if 100% of the personal property tax, as reflected in the personal property tax return for the preceding taxable year, is made by the last instalment date (15 May).
In general, all personal property not specifically exempted, including cash, finished goods inventory, supplies, depreciable property, leasehold improvements and CIP/WIP assets, is subject to the tax. Real depreciable property and CIP/WIP assets will also be subject to personal property tax unless the taxpayer formally request to include their valuation within the valuation subject to real property taxes. Leasehold improvements will be included with the lessee's valuation subject to personal property tax unless the lessor formally requests to include the value of the improvements on their valuation subject to real property taxes.
The personal property tax is generally based on the book value of the asset as of 1 January. Finished goods inventory, however, is assessed on the average of the monthly balances for the 12-month period preceding 1 January of each year.
The valuation of the personal property subject to tax is determined by multiplying the book value of such property by the applicable tax rate determined by the municipality in which the property is located. If the book value of depreciable property is below its estimated residual value, the property should be assessed at its estimated residual value.
## Real property taxes
The property tax system is administered by the MRCC. The tax on real property is directly assessed by the MRCC and may be paid in two instalments. The tax, (which varies from a minimum of 8.03% to a maximum of 11.83%, depending on the municipality) is applied to an amount based on the hypothetical fair market value (FMV) of the relevant property in the year 1957. In general terms, this hypothetical FMV normally ranges between 40% and 50% of the cost of the property.
## Transfer taxes
Puerto Rico does not have transfer tax provisions.
## Stamp taxes
Puerto Rico does not have stamp tax provisions. However, recordation fees are imposed at the time of officially recording a real estate transaction with the Puerto Rico Property Registry.
## Withholding taxes on salaries and wages
All employers are required to withhold Puerto Rico income tax from all wages paid to its employees. However, non-resident employers not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico that employ Puerto Rico residents as remote workers are not required to withhold income taxes on wages paid to those employees.
## Federal Social Security and Medicare (FICA)
The Federal Social Security and Medicare Law applies in full in Puerto Rico. The tax rate is imposed on both the employer and the employee. For 2018, the tax rate is 7.65%, which consists of 6.2% of Social Security and 1.45% of Medicare Tax. The Social Security Tax is calculated on the first USD 128,400 (year 2017) of wages received, and the Medicare Tax is calculated on the total wages, without ceiling.
In addition, an employer must withhold a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax from wages paid to an employee in excess of USD 200,000 (for a single taxpayer; married filing jointly is USD 250,000 and married filing separately is USD 125,000) in a calendar year. The employer is required to begin withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which wages are paid in excess of USD 200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Additional Medicare Tax. All wages that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding if paid in excess of the USD 200,000 withholding threshold.
## State (PR) Unemployment Tax (SUTA)
The unemployment tax is paid only by the employer and is paid on the first USD 7,000 of total wages paid to each employee during the calendar year, based on an experience rating system. In addition, the employer must also pay a special tax equal to 1% of the wages subject to unemployment tax. However, the special tax together with the experience-based tax cannot exceed 5.4%.
## Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA)
Similar to the FICA, FUTA also applies in Puerto Rico. All persons who employ at least one individual during any 20-week period or pay USD 1,500 or more in salaries during any trimester of the calendar year are subject to the FUTA tax.
The employer is solely responsible for payment of the tax. The rate is 6.0% on the first USD 7,000 of total wages paid during the calendar year to each employee. However, a credit of 5.4% is granted for the Puerto Rico unemployment tax paid. Therefore, the effective tax rate is 0.6% (6.0% less 5.4%).
## Disability insurance
The Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources Bureau of Employment Security also administers the disability insurance program. This program is funded principally through the imposition of a tax, in equal amounts, on the employer and employee.
A contributory tax of 0.6% is imposed on the first USD 9,000 of the total wages paid in the year. From the total tax, half (0.3%) is paid by the employer and the other half by the employee.
Employers may establish private insurance plans if approved by the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources.
## Workmen’s Accident Compensation Insurance
The Workmen’s Accident Compensation Insurance Act (WACA) establishes a compulsory insurance program that covers employees who suffer injury, become disabled, or lose their lives due to a job related accident. The insurance premium is based on total wages paid during the government’s fiscal year, which runs from 1 July to 30 June. The actual rates vary among industry types. The employer is solely responsible for payment of the assessed premium.
## Chauffeurs' Social Security
Every employer having one or more drivers is subject to Chauffeurs’ Social Security tax. It also applies to an employer whose employees are usually or regularly required or allowed to operate a motor vehicle as an inherent part of their work.
The tax is imposed on both the employer and the employee as follows:
## Municipal license tax
Every corporation is required to file an annual volume-of-business declaration with each of the municipalities in which it establishes or conducts business operations during the year. The declaration must indicate the actual volume of business (i.e. net sales, gross income from any service rendered, and other gross receipts) attributable to each municipality. When a business operates in more than one municipality but does not receive income in all of them, the license tax shall be computed based on a distribution of sales apportioned to each municipality by square feet of the building used in each municipality.
For a non-financial business, the license tax payment varies from a minimum of 0.20% to a maximum of 0.50%, depending on each municipality. The payment must be made in two equal instalments on or before 15 July and 15 January on the basis of the volume of business generated by the entity during its accounting year ended within the immediately preceding calendar year before the due date of the declaration. A 5% discount is available when the tax is fully paid on the declaration due date (on or before five working days after 15 April of each year).
For the first six months after a new business is established, the new company is generally exempt from the municipal license tax, provided that the business informs the municipality that it has established a new business in the municipality within the first 30 days of operations and requests the provisional license tax as established in each municipality. A copy of the municipal licence is generally requested as a perquisite for obtaining other licences and permits in Puerto Rico.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
A domestic corporation is taxable in Puerto Rico on its worldwide income. A foreign corporation engaged in trade or business in Puerto Rico is taxed at the regular corporate tax rates on income from Puerto Rico sources that is effectively connected income. In the case of a non-resident foreign corporation, a 29% withholding tax (WHT) rate is applicable on its Puerto Rico-source gross income not effectively connected with a Puerto Rico trade or business.
The current corporate income tax (CIT) rate is comprised of an 18.5% normal tax and a graduated surtax (computed on the 'surtax net income').
The 'surtax net income' is basically the net taxable income subject to regular tax less a surtax special deduction in the amount of USD 25,000. The graduated surtax rates are as follows:
Component members of a controlled group are required to share the surtax special deduction. The managing member of the group is responsible for annually filing the apportionment of the surtax deduction amongst members in Form 2652. Members excluded from the annual controlled group requirements are: members that were part of the group for less than half of a calendar year; members exempt from taxes such as NPOs; foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in PR; and corporations taxed as insurance companies in Puerto Rico.
## Alternative minimum tax (AMT)
The AMT includes various AMT adjustments in order to calculate the tentative minimum tax. Such minimum tax is subject to an 18.5% flat rate, or 23% in the case of taxpayers with gross proceeds of USD 10 million or more.
A corporation is not allowed to claim the same deductions it claimed for regular income tax purposes. Instead, a corporation is allowed to claim a limited amount of deductions such as wages, rents, utilities, marketing, depreciation, insurance, health plan contributions, charitable donations, bad-debts, and certain taxes. In this regard, some of these expenses must be reported in informative returns to be deductible.
Notwithstanding, if the corporation submits audited financial statements, an agreed upon procedure, or a compliance attestation report issued by a Puerto Rico CPA certifying the expenses as ordinary and necessary with its income tax return, the corporation may claim the same deductions it claims for regular income tax for purposes of computing its income subject to AMT, subject to AMT limitations on depreciation and NOLs, among others. In determining the alternative minimum net income, the NOL is limited to 70% of the alternative minimum net income. Also, the amount of the tax credit available with respect to the AMT paid in prior years that may be claimed against the current year regular tax is limited to 25% of the current net regular tax over the AMT for such taxable year. The AMT credit can be carried forward indefinitely.
## Tax on deemed dividends
A 10% tax is imposed on certain corporation on the deemed dividend amount attributable to a foreign owner. A foreign owner is defined as any non-resident person (or entity not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico) who directly owns 50% or more of the corporation's stocks. The deemed dividend amount is computed using the lesser of the average value of the total foreign assets or the accumulated earnings and profits of the corporation.
## Tax on improper accumulation of income
A surtax of 50% is imposed on corporations that improperly accumulate earnings to prevent the imposition of tax on shareholders or partners rather than paying the earnings out as dividends. The tax is not imposed on accumulated earnings and profits but is imposed on the net income for the year computed without taking capital loss carryover or NOL carryover deductions and reduced by the following items: Puerto Rico income taxes paid or accrued, disallowed net capital losses, and charitable contributions in excess of the deductible amount. The net income does not include industrial income exempted from income taxes under Industrial Incentives Acts. However, an exempt business can be subject to the penalty tax on non-exempt income.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Significant developments

The Governor of Puerto Rico, on 16 April 2020, signed House Bill No. 2419 into law as Act No. 40-2020 (Act 40), which included several technical amendments to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended (PR-IRC). In particular, Act 40 introduced a trading in commodities safe harbour for foreign corporations and non-resident individuals, increased the threshold for submitting audited financial statements with Puerto Rico income and personal property tax returns, and clarified the date on which a partnership classification election becomes effective for entities that convert into limited liability companies (LLCs) during the tax year.
Act 40 also expanded the definition of ‘merchant’ to include marketplace facilitators and marketplace sellers and imposes sales tax collection obligations on marketplace facilitators with respect to sales of certain taxable property made by marketplace sellers delivered or dispatched by mail to persons in Puerto Rico. Regarding the effective date of the marketplace rules, Act 173-2020 made these rules effective on 1 January 2021.
Also, on 14 June 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed House Bill No. 2468 into law as Act No. 57-2020, which allowed taxpayers to carry back net operating losses (NOLs) realised during the 2020 tax year due to the COVID-19 emergency to each of the two previous tax years, subject to certain limitations.
Additionally, on 30 June 2022, the Governor of Puerto Rico enacted Act No. 52-2022 (Act 52), which included amendments to manufacturing tax incentives laws and to the PR-IRC. The amendments to the tax incentive laws were primarily aimed to provide a framework to migrate the income and excise taxes imposed on non-resident foreign entities subject to Act 154-2010 effectively connected income source rules into an income-based tax regime applied through their related resident entities operating under manufacturing tax decrees. The new income-based tax regime was necessary to curtail the effect of the final foreign tax credit regulations released by the Federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which disallows credits for taxes paid to Puerto Rico under the Expanded ECI Rules brought by Act 154-2010 for tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2023.
Other amendments brought by Act 52 were:
Administrative Determination 22-10 (AD 22-10), issued on 21 November 2022, provided further guidance in regard to the concepts of disregarded entities and pass-through entities introduced to the PR-IRC by Act 52. AD 22-10 clarifies that the election to be treated as a disregarded entity is optional and will only be available for LLCs with a single individual owner who must be either a US citizen or a PR resident alien.
This optional election will be available for tax years started after 31 December 2021 for all eligible taxpayers except for certain Foreign LLCs. Foreign LLCs taxed as pass-through or disregarded entities under Federal law or a foreign country’s laws will be able to elect to be treated as a disregarded entity for Puerto Rico income tax purposes, regardless of if the single owner is an individual or not, for tax years started 31 December 2022. The election will be made on a revised Form 6045, which will be due on the due date of the income tax return (including extensions) of the tax year in which the election will be effective.
Entities electing to be treated as disregarded entities will not be exempted from the filing of other corporate tax returns, such as Withholding Returns, Sales and Use Tax Returns, Municipal Licenses, and Personal Property Tax returns, among other compliance.
AD 22-10 also confirmed that the election to be treated as a pass-through entity will be available to LLCs, partnerships, and corporations even when they possess a single owner. Existing entities that were treated as partnerships, special partnerships, or corporations of individuals in their last tax year will automatically be considered as having made an election to be treated as a pass-through entity effective 1 January 2022 and will not need to file an election with Form 6045.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
A corporation organised or created under the laws of Puerto Rico is a domestic corporation. A domestic corporation is a resident corporation even if it does not conduct business operations in Puerto Rico. A corporation created elsewhere is considered a foreign corporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Puerto Rico Tax Code does not provide specific guidance on PE. Facts and circumstances need to be analysed in order to determine if a corporation has created a PE in Puerto Rico or not. However, having an office or fixed place of business in Puerto Rico may deem the corporation to be engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico (i.e. having a PE).
## Sourcing rules pursuant to Act No. 154
Act No. 154's source rules are segregated into two parts. The first part treats a non-Puerto Rico resident manufacturing entity as having an office or fixed place of business in Puerto Rico merely as a result of engaging in transactions above a certain threshold with a related Puerto Rico entity. The second part treats a portion of the income earned by a non-Puerto Rico resident entity as Puerto Rico-source income.
Act No. 154's source rule applies where a non-Puerto Rico resident purchases goods and services from a related company that manufactures personal property or performs services in Puerto Rico that account for 10% or more of the total gross receipts of the seller from sales of such property or services in Puerto Rico, or at least 10% of the purchase cost of personal property and services acquired by the purchaser, for the taxable year or any of the three prior taxable years.
Where Act No. 154's source rule applies, a portion of the income of the non-Puerto Rico resident purchaser from the sale outside of Puerto Rico of personal property manufactured or produced in whole or part in Puerto Rico by the related Puerto Rico seller will be treated as Puerto Rico-source income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a Puerto Rico trade or business. The portion of the non-Puerto Rico resident’s income that is treated as Puerto Rico source is determined under an equally weighted, four-factor (i.e. purchases, sales, property, and payroll) formulary apportionment method. Where the purchaser fails to provide adequate documentation regarding the formulary apportionment factors, 50% of the income of the non-Puerto Rico resident purchaser from the sale outside of Puerto Rico of personal property manufactured or produced in whole or part in Puerto Rico by the related Puerto Rico seller will be treated as sourced where the property is manufactured or produced (i.e. Puerto Rico). The source rule also will apply to agency and commissionaire arrangements, in addition to buy-sell transactions involving related parties. In addition, the source rule contains an anti-abuse provision that disregards a transaction, for purposes of the source rule, where one of the principal purposes of the transaction is avoidance of the source rule.
As of 30 June 2022, the related Puerto Rico manufacturing entity can request an amendment to their tax grant to make an election to be taxed at an alternate fixed tax rate (alternate rate) of 10.5% in exchange for an exemption of the Act 154 sourcing rules for the non-Puerto Rico resident. The alternate rate changes permanently to 15% if the United States ever amends their tax laws to impose a CIT of at least 15%.
Other benefits obtained through the alternate rate election are income and royalties exemptions, which vary depending primarily on if a grantee meets certain thresholds of direct employment and industrial development income.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
All ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business are deductible by corporations operating in Puerto Rico.
## Depreciation
A reasonable depreciation allowance is deductible for the exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence of property used in business. The most common depreciation method used by corporations is the straight-line method. Nevertheless, any other consistent method may be used in lieu of the straight-line method as long as it is in accordance with the recognised trade practice. In addition, a corporation (other than one that is exempt under an Industrial Incentives Act) can elect an accelerated depreciation method for new or used tangible property acquired by purchase in taxable years commencing after 30 June 1995.
For property acquired after 31 December 2009, when using the straight-line depreciation method, the useful life has to be determined based on the same rules of accelerated depreciation.
| Assets | Useful life (years) |
| --- | --- |
| 3 year property (e.g. computers, electronic equipment) | 3 |
| 5 year property (e.g. automobiles, transportation equipment) | 5 |
| 7 year property (e.g. certain furniture and fixtures, air transportation equipment) | 7 |
| 15 year property (e.g. certain air transportation equipment, natural gas plants) | 15 |
| 20 year property (e.g. vessels, land improvements) | 20 |
| Real property leased for residential purposes | 30 |
| Other real property | 35 |
For intangibles (other than goodwill) acquired or created after 1 September 2010, the deduction is calculated using the straight-line method over the lower of a useful life of 15 years or the intangible’s useful life.
## Goodwill
The cost of goodwill is generally capitalised and amortised ratably over 15 years.
## Start-up expenses
Generally, start-up expenditures may be deducted in the tax year in which the trade or business begins or they may be ratably amortised over five years.
## Interest expenses
In general, interest expense is deductible without limitation. However, interest expenses related to exempt income are not deductible. If interest is paid to a non-Puerto Rico resident related party, a 29% withholding at source applies. If the 29% withholding is not withheld, no deduction is available.
## Bad debt
Bad debt resulting from a trade or business may be deducted in the year the debt becomes worthless (i.e. uncollectible). The reserve method is not admissible for Puerto Rico purposes.
## Charitable contributions
Deductions for allowed charitable contributions are limited to 10% of net income, computed regardless of the contributions. These deductions are allowed to the extent they are made to charitable organisations organised under the laws of Puerto Rico, the United States, or any US possession that are qualified by the Secretary of the PRTD and provide services to residents of Puerto Rico.
## Rent expense
Corporations are entitled to a rent expense deduction if the rented property is used in the business.
## Employee remuneration
Corporations may deduct payments of reasonable salaries or other compensation for services actually rendered.
## Insurance premiums
Insurance premiums paid or accrued on risks related to a trade or business are deductible, as well as premiums on group life policies covering employees where the beneficiary is not the corporation. No deduction is allowed for premiums paid to an insurance company not authorised to provide insurance in Puerto Rico or through an agent or broker not authorised to operate in Puerto Rico.
## Meals and entertainment
Meals and entertainment expenses are deductible, subject to a 75% limitation. Travelling expenses would be subject to a 50% limitation.
## Automobiles expenses
A corporation is allowed to depreciate non-cargo automobiles used in a trade or business over a five-year useful life (three years in the case of sales persons) up to a maximum base of USD 30,000 for a maximum annual depreciation of USD 6,000.
On the other hand, for non-cargo automobile maintenance expenses (e.g. gas, repairs, insurance), a deduction based on USD 0.60 per mile is allowed. For taxable years commenced after 31 December 2018, the actual maintenance expense of a vehicle would be allowed in lieu of the mileage.
## Fines and penalties
Penalty payments, such as with respect to Commonwealth taxes, whether on account of negligence, delinquency, or fraud, are not deductible from gross income.
## Taxes
A corporation is allowed a deduction for taxes paid (except for Puerto Rico CIT), including income tax paid to the United States, its other possessions, and any foreign country. The deduction is in lieu of claiming a foreign tax credit.
## Other significant items
The cost of incidental repairs (not adding value to the property) is deductible as a business expense.
Subject to certain limitations, savings and retirement plans for the benefit of employees are deductible if qualified by the Secretary of the Treasury.
## Net operating losses (NOLs)
All corporations are generally entitled to the NOL deduction in computing their tax. NOLs created from taxable years beginning prior to 31 December 2012 (and after 31 December 2004) may be carried forward for 12 taxable years (there are no carryback provisions). For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2012, the NOL carryforward period is ten years. The use of the NOL deduction is limited to 80% of the taxable income for the year. The NOL to be carried forward should exclude the deductible portion of the expenses or payments to foreign affiliates.
For taxable years commenced after 31 December 2018, the NOL deduction limitation is increased to 90% of net taxable income before NOLs as opposed to the 80% NOL limitation applicable for taxable years commenced after 31 December 2014 and ending before 1 January 2019. In addition, for taxable years commenced after 31 December 2018, corporate partners that own 50% or more of a partnership are not allowed to use their current year standalone NOLs as well as standalone NOL carryforwards to offset their distributive share of partnership income.
Losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets are allowed only to the extent of gains from such sales or exchanges. The carryforward period in this instance, however, is seven years. The use of capital losses is limited to 80% of the capital gains for the taxable year. However, for taxable years commenced after 31 December 2018, the capital loss limitation is increased to 90% of net capital gain before capital loss.
NOLs realised during the 2020 taxable year are allowed a two-year carryback, first against the 2018 taxable year and any remaining amounts against the 2019 taxable year. There is a maximum carryback of USD 200,000, and taxpayers may receive a refund of up to USD 50,000. The carryback is not available for taxpayers that generate more than USD 10 million in gross revenues nor for large taxpayers.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to grant a 100% deduction for the expenses paid or incurred with related parties not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico via the waiver mechanism. However, the deduction is limited to 60% of the expenses that qualify for the waiver.
Expenses paid or incurred with related parties not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico for which a waiver from the Secretary of the Treasury is not obtained do not generate NOL carryforward (i.e. the expenses are added back to the NOL). In other words, the non-disallowed portion of the payments to foreign affiliates/branches will not be allowed if this particular portion causes an NOL.
For taxable years commenced after 31 December 2018, the 51% disallowance with respect to expenses paid or incurred with a related person that is not engaged in trade or business in Puerto Rico may not apply if the taxpayer submits a transfer pricing study prepared pursuant to the provision of Section 482 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Furthermore, for taxable years commenced after 31 December 2018, the related party expense deduction will be allowed as deduction, even if such deduction causes an NOL.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
Puerto Rico does not have group taxation rules. In other words, corporations cannot file a consolidated return for Puerto Rico CIT purposes.
## Transfer pricing
There are no specific transfer pricing rules in Puerto Rico.
For taxable years commenced after 31 December 2018, the PRIRC was amended to provide that the 51% disallowance with respect to expenses paid or incurred with a related person that is not engaged in trade or business in Puerto Rico may not apply if the taxpayer submits a transfer pricing study prepared pursuant to the provision of Section 482 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (USIRC), as amended.
We would expect for the PRTD to release regulations in this area to properly define the parameters of what will constitute the arm’s-length price with respect to transactions with related parties crossing the borders, using the technical guidelines established by Section 482 of the USIRC and any local Regulations.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific thin capitalisation rules in Puerto Rico.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no specific CFC rules in Puerto Rico.

# Puerto Rico
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
The Governor of Puerto Rico, on 1 July 2019, signed into law House Bill 1635 into Act 60-2019, known as the Incentives Code of Puerto Rico (the 'Incentives Code'). The Incentives Code consolidates incentives granted for diverse purposes throughout decades, like manufacturing activities and exportation of services, with the aim of promoting economic development more effectively. It is divided into six subtitles, and tax incentives are codified in different chapters of Subtitle B.
A corporation engaged in specific eligible activities, like manufacturing or exportation of services, may apply for a reduced CIT rate, among other incentives, through the request of a Tax Exemption Grant to the Puerto Rico Office of Industrial Tax Exemption (OITE) under the Incentives Code.
## Tax rate incentives
### Income tax
Exempt entities may elect one of the following two scenarios:
## Special deductions
Special deductions for exempt manufacturing businesses are available for capital investment in buildings, structure, and machinery and equipment.
## Credits
The following credits are only available for exempt manufacturing businesses under the Incentives Code:
### Credit for purchases of Puerto Rico manufactured product
Subject to certain limitations, the credit for purchases of products manufactured in Puerto Rico is 25%.
A 50% credit is granted for the eligible investment in R&D activities, including operational expenditures, clinical trials, infrastructure, renewable energy, or intellectual property (IP).
### Technology transfer credit
A 12% credit (2% in the case of exempt businesses that opted for the alternate tax) is available for payments made to resident entities for the use or privilege of using intangible property in Puerto Rico.
### Tax credit management (TCM) system
Act No. 52 of 2022 established the creation of a TCM system that will be in charge for the registry, tracking, transfer, and claiming of all PR tax credits. The carryover period of all previously issued tax credits with indefinite expiration dates will be restricted to three years beginning on 1 January 2023.
## Property tax incentives
The Incentives Code allows for a 75% property tax exemption on personal and real property for exempt manufacturing businesses. Under the provisions of the Incentives Code, a taxpayer can self-assess one's real property tax responsibility (similar to the current personal property tax system) and remit the related tax liability due along with a real property tax return (to be issued by the MRCC) by 15 May of each year. The self-appraisal method is only applicable to real property that has not been appraised by the MRCC and is mainly limited to machinery and equipment classified as real property. Note that this method is not available for assets such as land, buildings, and building equipment.
For exempt businesses due to export services, there is a 75% exemption from property taxes during the first 15 years of exempt operations.
## Municipal license tax and other municipal tax incentives
Under the Incentives Code, the municipal license tax exemption is 50% for exempted manufacturing businesses. Exempt businesses operating in Vieques or Culebra are 100% exempt for the first five years and have a 50% exemption for the remaining period of exemption. Small or medium-exempt businesses are also 100% exempt for the first five years and have a 50% exemption for the remaining period of exemption.
For exempt businesses due to export services, there is a 50% exemption from municipal license tax during the first 15 years of exempt operations.
## Opportunity Zones
Puerto Rico was included in the designation of Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs). Puerto Rico was able to designate 100% of its low-income areas as QOZs. Thus, out of the nearly 8,700 QOZs, 863 are in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico provisions related to QOZs were included in the Incentives Code, with the purpose of creating the legal framework for investment in QOZs in Puerto Rico and to adopt tax rules for the benefit of investors in Puerto Rico. The benefits are the following:
## Foreign tax credit
Generally, in any year, a taxpayer can choose whether to take as a credit (subject to limitation) or as a deduction the foreign income and excess profit taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to any foreign country or a US state. A foreign tax credit reduces the Puerto Rico income tax liability dollar for dollar, while a deduction reduces the Puerto Rico income tax liability at the marginal rate of the taxpayer. There are no carryforward provisions for foreign tax credit purposes.

# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Foreign tax relief
Puerto Rican residents may claim a credit against their tax liability (subject to limitations) for income taxes paid to foreign countries (including the United States and any state of the United States).
Non-resident individuals are not entitled to a credit for foreign taxes.
## Tax treaties
There are no tax treaties between foreign countries and Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has recognised that Puerto Rico is not a signatory party to a treaty entered into by the United States; if an international treaty does not explicitly include Puerto Rico, the treaty will not be applicable to Puerto Rico.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Itemised deductions
Puerto Rican residents and non-resident US citizens can claim the following itemised deductions to reduce their gross income. Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals may not claim these deductions.
### Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions will be allowed as a deduction to the extent they are made to charitable organisations qualified by the Secretary and provide services to residents of Puerto Rico.
The contributions are subject to 50% of adjusted gross income (AGI).
### Education expenses
Interest paid on student loans for qualified individuals is deductible, as are contributions to Puerto Rican educational individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
### Medical expenses
Qualified medical expenses in excess of 6% of AGI are allowed as deductions.
### Mortgage interest
Mortgage interest paid on qualified residential property is deductible, limited to USD 35,000 or 30% of AGI, whichever is lower.
### Retirement plans
Contributions to Puerto Rican IRAs are deductible, limited to USD 5,000 per individual in addition to contributions made to employer sponsored qualified retirement plans. Contributions to government retirement systems are also deductible.
For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2018, contributions to governmental pension or retirement systems will be considered a reduction to the taxable wages, instead of an itemised deduction available in the tax return.
### Casualty losses
Casualty losses on a primary residence and certain personal property can be claimed as deductions.
### Health Savings Account contributions
Contributions to a Health Savings Account will not be allowed as itemised deductions.
## Standard deductions
There is no standard deduction in Puerto Rico.
## Personal exemptions
The personal exemption is USD 3,500 per individual and USD 7,000 for married taxpayers living together and filing jointly.
The exemption for each dependant is USD 2,500.
The veteran's exemption is USD 1,500.
Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals are not allowed any exemptions.
## Net operating loss (NOL) deduction
For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2018, the NOL carryforward allowed will be increased from 80% to 90% of the net income.
The current 50% limitation on the NOL carryover for individuals with a net loss in a trade or business for three consecutive taxable years is eliminated, thus allowing a 100% NOL carryover.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Employment income
Employment income includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for rendered services, and received in any form of payment (i.e. cash or in kind), unless specifically excluded. Typically, taxable compensation includes salaries, wages, Christmas bonus, incentive compensation, benefits in kind, etc.
Reimbursement of expenses incurred by the employee to carry out their duties or responsibilities may be considered business expenses. For example, if an employee must travel for business meetings to another location where they must stay overnight, the expenses incurred for travel and lodging in such a case are generally considered business expenses incurred on behalf of the employer. The reimbursement of these expenses may be excluded from compensation if certain requirements are met.
## Capital gains and investment income
All capital gains and investment income of a Puerto Rican resident are taxable for Puerto Rican purposes.
### Capital gains
The holding period to qualify as long-term capital gain will depend on the date of sale or exchange. Long-term tax treatment will apply to those capital assets held for more than one year.
Long-term capital gains are subject to a special tax rate of 15%. Short-term capital gains are subject to the regular gradual rates.
In the case of long-term capital gains, Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals are subject to a flat withholding rate of 25%. Puerto Rican non-resident US citizens are only subject to a flat withholding rate of 15% on long-term capital gains.
### Investment income
Investment income is subject to regular gradual rates unless specific requirements are met. For example, interest may be subject to a flat rate of 10% or 17% and dividends to a flat rate of 15%.
In the case of Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals, investment income, such as rent and interest income, is subject to a flat rate of 29%, and dividends to a flat rate of 15% (or a lower flat rate in certain cases).

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Act 132 - Real Property Market Stimulus Act
The act provides for 100% exemption from income tax (as well as exemption from the ABT) for a period of up to 15 years beginning on 1 January 2011 and ending on 31 December 2025 for rental income received on residential property leased. The tax exemption provided will apply to income earned, both with respect to leases that are signed after the enactment of this Act, including those signed after 30 June 2011, as well as contracts that were already signed at the time of approval of this Act. Therefore, rental income subject to this exemption will also be exempt from income tax withholding at source. To be able to benefit from this exemption, the lessor still needs to include in their Puerto Rico income tax return the income earned as well as the location of the property leased and reflect the income as exempt. Otherwise, the net rental income will be subject to tax per the regular provisions established by the Code.
## Act 22 - The Individual Investors Act (now included under Act 60 of PR Tax Incentive Code of July 2019)
Act 22 (as amended), also known as The Individual Investors Act, was approved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico during 2012. The purpose of this Act is to provide incentives to individuals who have not been residents of Puerto Rico to become residents. In order to encourage the transfer of such individuals to Puerto Rico, the Act exempts from Puerto Rico income tax their passive income, which may consists of interest, dividends, and capital gains.
The Act applies to all individual investors who become 'Puerto Rico Residents' on or before 31 December 2035, provided that such individuals were not residents of Puerto Rico at any time during the ten-year period preceding the effective date of the Act (last date amended: 1 July 2019).
Both US and non-US citizens may qualify under the Act. Puerto Rico residents who are temporarily outside of Puerto Rico do not qualify as they are still deemed to be Puerto Rico residents.
To qualify for the exemptions granted under the Act, every so-called Resident Individual Investor (i.e. a tax resident qualifying under the Act) must request a tax exemption decree from the Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce. The tax exemption decree will provide details of the tax treatment and shall be considered a contract between the Resident Individual Investor and the Puerto Rico government.
The decree may be revoked by the Secretary if any of the following events occur:
### Exemption period
The income tax exemption will apply only to investment income recognised during the period that starts on the date the individual is domiciled in Puerto Rico and ends on 31 December 2035 (exemption period). After this date, those residents who took advantage of the exemptions granted will be taxed as any other Puerto Rico resident and as stated in the PR Code.
### Investment income exempt under the Act
Interest and dividend income received by Resident Individual Investors during the exemption period will be fully exempt from PR income taxation. The exemption applies to all sources of such income (i.e. Puerto Rico, United States, and foreign).
In the case of capital gains, the Act provides for either a full PR income tax exemption or a reduced tax rate, depending on certain requirements.
## Act 257
### Earned Income Credit (EIC)
For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2019, taxpayers who are residents of Puerto Rico during the entire year who are 27 years old and beyond will be entitled to claim the EIC.
The credit will range from 5% to 12.5% of the gross earned income (subject to limitations) depending on the amount of dependants claimed by the taxpayer.
The credit is not available for married taxpayers filing separate tax returns.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
The term 'resident individual' means an individual who is domiciled in Puerto Rico. It should be presumed that an individual is a resident of Puerto Rico if they have been present in Puerto Rico for a period of 183 days during the calendar year. However, individuals deriving income for services performed within Puerto Rico may be subject to taxation in Puerto Rico even though such individuals may have not been physically present in Puerto Rico for at least 183 days (i.e. 'non-resident individual').
