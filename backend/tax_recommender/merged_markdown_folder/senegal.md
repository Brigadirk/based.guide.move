## Overview
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Senegal, located in Western Africa, is bordered by Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Senegal is divided into 14 regions, each administered by a regional council, with Dakar as its capital. The official language of Senegal is French, and the currency is the *Communauté financière d'Afrique* (Financial Community of Africa or CFA) franc (XOF).
Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation. As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal is working towards greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. Senegal is also a member of the Organisation for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).
The main industries of Senegal include food processing, mining, cement, artificial fertiliser, chemicals, textiles, refining imported petroleum, and tourism.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is generally stated at the lower of cost or market value. Last in first out (LIFO) and first in first out (FIFO) are permitted. Book and tax conformity is required.
## Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the transfer of assets are subject to the 30% CIT. There is no basket system. Sales of stocks by a non-resident are liable to the 30% CIT, subject to the application of a DTT.
## Dividend income
If a parent company domiciled in Senegal owns 10% of the subsidiary (main condition for the application of the parent-subsidiary corporation special taxation status), a 95% reduction on the dividends received is applicable for CIT purposes.
If these conditions are not met, dividends received by a company are subject to CIT as follows:
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are unusual in Senegal. However, this kind of distribution would be taxable at the general WHT rate of 10% on the basis of its real value.
## Interest income
Article 105 of the GTC provides a list of interests that are not subject to CIT. For instance, the following are not subject to CIT:
## Royalty income
There are no specific provisions for royalty income. In general and in case of foreign payment, they are subject to 20% WHT (subject to a DTT that can limit or exempt the WHT), and in any case to 18% reverse VAT.
## Foreign income
In general, profits generated in Senegal are taxed under Senegal’s income tax law. Profits generated outside Senegal and constituting a PE in the relevant country are not taxed in Senegal. A DTT can provide different rules.

VAT on tourism activities is 10%.
A 17% special tax on financial activities (mainly banking, money transfers, interest, premiums and other remunerations received on loans, keeping of bank accounts or equivalent, financial intermediation, and change operations) is applicable instead of VAT.
VAT returns must be filed monthly.
Recently FY25 Finance Law sets the mandatory issuance of electronic invoices via a public invoicing portal or a platform set up by the administration for VAT payers, under penalty of a fine of 25% of the amount of VAT invoiced or due, capped at XOF 5 million.
## Customs duties/Import tariffs
In the case of import of goods, the following tariffs apply:
## Excise taxes

- Produced in Senegal:

## Tax on built real estate
The tax on built real estate applies annually to owners of buildings other than factories and industrial premises. Companies are no longer liable to the tax on built real estate on their properties listed in the balance sheet.

## Payroll taxes
### Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE)
All compensation (including salary, cash allowances, and benefits in kind) paid to employees is generally taxable. For the calculation of the personal income tax (PIT) to be withheld by the employer, the tax administration provides a tax table determined on a monthly basis so that no calculation is necessary.
### Employer tax
Employers are subject to a 3% tax based on the total gross salaries paid to employees.
## Social Security contributions
Social Security contributions are borne exclusively by the employer.
The rate for the industrial accident/occupational disease branch has to be confirmed by the authority when registering the entity with the Social Security Office (applicable rate to be stated within the related certificate).
| Sector | Rate of contributions (only payable by employers) (%) | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Family | 7 | 63,000 |
| Industrial accident / Occupational disease | 1/3/5 | 63,000 |
## Retirement contributions
Retirement contributions are payable both by the employer and the employees:
| Regime | Rates of contributions (%) | | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payable by employers | Payable by employees (withheld on the salary) |
| General | 8.4 | 5.6 | 432,000 |
| Executive | 3.6 | 2.4 | 1,296,000 |
## Employment medical coverage
The employer shall subscribe for all employees a medical coverage. The level of coverage depends on the type of agreement concluded with the dedicated organism. Usually, the employee is reimbursed for 80% of medical expenses, even though the law provides a range between 50% and 80%.
The maximum monthly rate is 15%, to be levied on a contribution rate that cannot exceed XOF 250,000, for both the employee and the employer.
## Local Economic Contribution (*Contribution Economique Locale* or CEL)
The CEL is a new contribution replacing the business license tax and consisting of two different taxes:
The company’s properties contribution is assessed annually on the rental value of the company’s business premises. The rental value corresponds to 7% of the cost price.
The applicable rates are 15% for leases premises and 20% for owned premises, lands, and installations.
The company added value contribution is based on the added value produced by a company during the previous year. The tax rate is 1%. An upper ceiling of 70% of the turnover applies to the company added value contribution.
Specific tax rates are provided for companies such as operators of public telecommunication networks licensed in Senegal (0.30%) and port facility operators (1.5%).
## Tax on telecommunication
The tax rate is 5% on telecommunication use and access.
## Tax on vehicles
An owner of a motor vehicle (car, truck, or motorbike) must pay an annual tax fixed at XOF 1,000 per hectolitre, except for the pirogue gasoline.
## Company tax on vehicles
In addition to the tax on vehicles, companies owning or renting vehicles (more than 15 days a year) must pay a specific annual tax on them. Rates range from XOF 50,000 to XOF 200,000, depending on the type and horsepower of the vehicle.
## Levy on insurance companies (LIC)
Insurance companies approved in Senegal are liable to the LIC (fixed at 1% and a reduced rate of 0.5% for life insurance).
The basis of the LIC is turnover.
## Tax on insurance contracts
## Sampling of consignments of petroleum products and hydrocarbon stores from foreign-flagged vessels
The taxable basis of this levy shall be:
This levy is fixed at XOF 10 per net kilogram. The liquidation, recovery, and litigation of this levy are done as in customs.
The Industry Energy Tax rate is 2.5%, applied to the price excluding tax, of electricity consumed by the taxable person.
Individuals or entities considered as industrial operators are subject to this tax.
In addition, the electricity consumption of companies that have signed an agreement with the State of Senegal that exempts them from indirect taxes during the period of validity of the said agreement is exempt from this tax. Electricity exports made by SENELEC are also exempt from this tax.
## Export duties on non-monetary gold
## WHT on sale of hydrocarbons by non-resident entities
A tax equal to XOF 0.5 per kilogram sold is due by foreign companies that sell directly to local or foreign authorised importers the hydrocarbons they have in tanks built in Senegal.

# Senegal
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Senegal is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Companies must file CIT returns, tax on disallowable expenses return, simplified transfer pricing return, LEC on added value, and financial statements by 30 April of the year following the tax year.
Also, in addition to the miscellaneous annual returns (LEC on rental value, company car tax, etc.) and other monthly tax returns (VAT, payroll taxes, WHT, etc.), taxpayers must file by 31 January for the prior financial year:
## Payment of tax
CIT must be paid in two instalments (each equal to one-third of the previous year’s tax) by 15 February and 30 April. The outstanding balance payment amount of the tax due must be paid by 15 June.
For the first financial year of a newly incorporated company, no instalment is due; the new company pays the whole CIT before 15 June of the following year.
### Penalties
In case of late payment, a 5% interest of delay on the amount due plus an additional 0.5% duty per month of delay or portion of month of delay are applicable. This late payment is due when the taxpayer’s regularisation is spontaneous.
On the other hand, if such payment is triggered by a tax audit from the authority itself after the deadline is crossed, the following penalties apply:
Also, the late filling of tax returns triggers an XOF 200,000 penalty per return.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities may request information, clarifications, or justification to the taxpayers. The taxpayers have 20 days to answer to those requests.
The tax authorities may also implement an inspection of the accounting documents at the premises of the taxpayer or at any place the taxpayer would consider more appropriate for material reasons upon a specific request. In such cases, a notice is sent to the taxpayer at least five days before the beginning of the inspection.
The tax authorities are not allowed to process a new tax inspection on a period already inspected by their services unless a new element or document is revealed after the first inspection was processed.
Where the tax authorities estimate that the taxpayer has not fulfilled all of one’s tax obligation, a tax reassessment shall be transmitted to the taxpayer, who has 30 days in order to answer or comment on the findings.
After the tax authorities have received those comments, they can confirm partially or totally the reassessment within a statutory delay of 60 days.
With the Finance Law FY24, the tax authorities are no longer entitled to carry out a remote tax audit on tax and duties that have already been reassessed by an on-site tax audit for a certain period, to risk the complete voidness of the procedure. However, during the period of the on-site audit, the company may still use the means of control provided for in articles 571, 576, and 577 of GTC.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is, generally speaking, four years.
With regards to corporate tax compliance, the tax authorities are generally focusing on certain expenses with forbidden or limited deductibility, such as depreciation of assets, provisions, interest, royalties/services fees, insurance premiums, head office costs, etc., but they usually define their approach according to the business sector of the company.
Recently, tax authorities have also focused on transfer pricing issues by requiring documentation upon their tax audit. The implementation of BEPS Action 13 is likely to result in more interest on this subject.

In any cases, salary income is taxable in Senegal, provided that the work is performed in Senegal or the employer is established there.
The personal income tax (PIT) corresponds to a progressive duty to be applied to the taxable income of individuals, including net salaries.
## Personal income tax rates
By splitting one's income into shares (personal allowances), the taxpayer benefits from the progressive rates for each share. To calculate the total tax payable, the tax corresponding to each share is thereafter multiplied by the number of shares. The following scale shows the different rates applicable to income.
| Annual income (XOF\*) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 630,000 | 0 |
| 630,001 | 1,500,000 | 20 |
| 1,500,001 | 4,000,000 | 30 |
| 4,000,001 | 8,000,000 | 35 |
| 8,000,001 | 13,500,000 | 37 |
| 13,500,001 | 50,000,000 | 40 |
| 50,000,001 | And over | 43 |
\* *Communauté financière d'Afrique* (Financial Community of Africa or CFA) francs
## Minimum personal income tax (MPIT)
Any employee is liable to MPIT, and the amount is fixed as follows:
| Annual income (XOF) | | MPIT (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 599,999 | 900 |
| 600,000 | 999,999 | 3,600 |
| 1,000,000 | 1,999,999 | 4,800 |
| 2,000,000 | 6,999,999 | 12,000 |
| 7,000,000 | 11,999,999 | 18,000 |
| 12,000,000 | And over | 36,000 |
## Withholding taxes (WHTs)
### WHT on remuneration paid for services rendered by local providers
The Senegalese debtor must withhold 5% on remuneration paid to individuals who are resident in Senegal in exchange for services. This WHT is only applicable when the service is provided by an individual liable for tax under the lump-sum taxation regime (very small businesses), when the provider is not able to prove its tax registration (for instance, one does not have a tax identification number), or when the provider is a tax-transparent entity that has not opted for corporate income tax (CIT) liability.
The Senegalese debtor must pay the amount withheld to the tax authorities within 15 days following the month of payment of the invoice.
### WHT on remuneration paid for services rendered by foreign single providers or foreign companies
### WHT on rent for real estate
Rents paid to individuals are subject to a 5% WHT, which shall be withheld at source by the lessee.
The WHT on rent is not applicable in the following cases:
This WHT shall be paid to the tax authorities within 15 days after the month of payment of the rent. In addition, a quarterly and annual recapitulative declaration shall be filed.
### WHTs on financial incomes
Tax is withheld at source from the following income (subject to double tax treaties [DTTs] and specific exemptions):

## Tax returns
All individuals subject to PIT must file a tax return before 1 May of each year for all income (e.g. salary, movable assets) earned during the past year, except in cases where salaries are the sole category of income the employee benefits from and if those salaries have been properly submitted via withholding by the employer during the year.
## Payment of tax
Social security contributions and PIT on an individual’s wages are withheld monthly by employers and are computed on the basis of gross remuneration paid, including fringe benefits and bonuses.

## Minimum CIT
A minimum CIT is due, in case of lack of profits, at the rate of 0.5% applied on the annual turnover. The maximum amount cannot be more than XOF 5 million.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Recent changes to the General Tax Code (GTC)
Finance Law for FY25 has added new provisions to the GTC.
Key changes of the law are as follows:
### **Issuance of electronic invoices**
The FY25 Finance Law sets the mandatory issuance of electronic invoices via a public invoicing portal or a platform set up by the administration for VAT payers, under penalty of a fine of 25% of the amount of VAT invoiced or due, capped at XOF 5 million (articles 447 and 667 of GTC).
### **Withholding tax on amounts paid by private healthcare establishments**
The new Finance Law establishes a 10% withholding tax on amounts paid by private healthcare establishments to members of the medical and paramedical professions who are not part of their staff (Article 212 ter of GTC).
### **Increasing of the rate of the specific tax on tobacco**
Initially capped at 65% by article 434 of GTC, the rate of the specific tax on tobacco was increased from 65% to 70% by the FY25 Finance Law.
### **Alcohol tax: reorganization of the tax base**
The Finance Law for FY25 has provided a reorganization of the tax base on alcoholic liquid beverages, which now relates to the quantity of alcoholic liquid contained in each beverage and not to the content.
### **Tax refund certificate**
The Finance Law provides the adoption of the tax refund certificate as the preferred means of payment for refund requests (instead of payment by check or bank transfer).
The reimbursement by check or bank transfer will only be made upon the decision of the Minister of finance (Article 393 of GTC).
At the same time, submitting the tax refund request electronically has been provided (Article 692 of GTC).
### **Tax clearance certificate**
The FY25 Finance Law introduces a new obligation to request a tax clearance certificate dated less than 30 days, before any payment to foreign legal entities with permanent professional installations in Senegal, for construction and public works companies, cement producers, mining and oil companies and public service operators or concessionaires (Article 642 bis of GTC).
### **Ultimate beneficial owner return**
Previously the article 667 of GTC provides that any breaches of obligations relating to beneficial owners return are subject to a fine of XOF 10 million. FY25 Finance Law provides a reduction of the amount of the fine applicable from XOF 10 million to XOF 1 million for taxpayers not covered by the tax division in charge of major companies (Article 667 of GTC).
### **Extension of the benefit of the Export Free Enterprise (EFE) status**
The benefit of the Export Free Enterprise (EFE) Status was extended until December 31, 2025 by the article 39 of Finance Law.
### **Elimination of non-functional commissions**
Non-functional commissions have been eliminated by the FY 25 Finance Law, namely the joint commission on registration fees and the joint conciliation commission.
### **Elimination of tax measures**
Tax measures adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic are eliminated by the new Finance Law.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
The rates of depreciation are not provided by the law. The rate is determined on the normal and predictable duration of use of the asset by taking into account normal wear and tear. In practice, there are standard rates for common assets. Accelerated depreciation can be applicable, subject to conditions.
## Goodwill
There are no provisions in Senegal for goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible if justified and approved by the shareholders.
## Interest expenses
Interests on current account advances or loans from a shareholder (directly or indirectly) or a related party are subject to restrictions as to their deduction from taxable income.
There are two steps:
### Deductibility of interest paid to related parties
The interests payable directly or indirectly to a related party (an entity belonging to the same group as the borrower) is limited to the ones calculated on 1.5 times the paid share capital of the borrower, within the limits of the base rate (4.00% in 2022) plus 3 points and within a maximum of 15% of the ordinary profits, increased by the depreciation and provisions and the concerned interests.
The calculation of these limits is done for all interests paid to all related parties (directly or indirectly). Please note that such interests are deductible only if the share capital is fully paid up.
### Deductibility of all interests
The deductibility of all interests (payable to related or unrelated parties) is limited to 15% of the ordinary profits, increased by the depreciation and provisions and the concerned interests. For this calculation, the non-deductible interests due to related parties are excluded and interest incomes deducted ('net interests'). This second 15% limitation does not apply if the ratio of net interests of the group is equal to or higher than its own net interests ratio.
The group ratio (consolidated level figures of the group) is equal to the interests due to unrelated parties on the ordinary profits, increased by the depreciation and provisions and the interests payable to unrelated parties. In such case, the deductible interests are calculated by applying the group ratio. This limitation does not apply in case the annual interests are to be paid by a group of companies residing in Senegal to non-related companies and are lower than XOF 50 million, provided that they are not due to companies established in a privileged taxation regime (taxation below 30%).
The deductibility of the interests paid to individuals are limited to the remunerations of the amounts that do not exceed the share capital. The GTC has provided a definition of the concept of interests, which means any expense related to debt securities of any kind, including payments in return for the granting of a pledge for the repayment of a debt obligation, that would be considered as deductible. This definition leads to a wide acceptance of the concept of interests, from a common remuneration of a loan to an inter-company financing.
## Bad debt
There are no provisions in Senegal for bad debt.
## Charitable contributions
Only payments made to specific chartered organisations are deductible, at a rate of up to 0.5/100 of turnover. On the contrary, payments made to non-chartered organisations are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
CIT and the company tax on vehicles are not deductible.
## Other significant items
Provisions are deductible if they correspond to a risk or a probable cost that is more than possible and leads to a decrease in the assets. Provisions for paid holidays and retirement compensation are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses may be carried forward to the next three years. Losses corresponding to the depreciation of assets can be carried forward indefinitely. The carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Senegal.
## Transfer pricing
Companies with an annual turnover or amount of gross assets of at least XOF 5 billion are required to make available documentation upon a tax audit. This applies when the company directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of the share capital or more than 50% of the voting rights in another company.
An annual transfer pricing tax return shall also be provided with CIT filing (by April 30). This is a kind of simplified transfer pricing documentation, which includes information such as the description of the related companies and activities performed, group transfer pricing policy, intra-group flows, etc.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Companies with group revenues exceeding XOF 492 billion must file a CbC report showing the allocation of revenues, profits, and taxes paid. The company shall prepare consolidated financial statements, and own directly or indirectly one or more legal entities located in Senegal.
Also, the GTC sets out a series of criteria for a Senegalese entity to be required to file the CbC report and provides the application of a fine amounting to XOF 25 million in case of failure.
As a result, the CbC report must be:
Automatic exchange of the CbC report will take place between the Senegalese tax administration and other tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which the group operates and which have concluded a tax treaty providing such exchange with Senegal.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific rules regarding thin capitalisation in Senegal. Nonetheless, the following tax and legal rules should be known:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions in Senegal for CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
In general, the tax on branch income is similar to that of corporate income. Nonetheless, a 10% duty is automatically applied to profits generated after CIT. It corresponds to an automatic application of the 10% tax on payment on dividends applicable to a company.
Headquarter expenses, which are a proration of the worldwide office expenses, may be allocated to the Senegal branch. This proration is based upon a ratio of the local turnover of the branch and the worldwide turnover of the parent company. It applies to the total amount of headquarters’ expenses incurred by the company. In addition, the deductibility of headquarters’ expenses is limited to 20% of the accounting profits before the deduction. This limitation does not apply to other types of services provided by headquarters, such as technical assistance.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Usually, DTTs may provide some tax credit on the basis of the relationship between Senegalese entities and their partners located abroad. For each DTT, the specific process to enforce those tax credits either in Senegal or abroad (depending on the payments directions) are stipulated within that DTT. Nonetheless, as far Senegal is concerned, the practice consisting of enforcing foreign tax credits locally is very rare.
## The Investment Code
The Investment Code applies to investments over XOF 100 million (mainly production, processing, industrial, tourism, agricultural, and complex trade). The benefits of the Investment Code include exemption from customs duties, suspension of VAT payment for three years, CIT limitation, etc. The tax benefits are directly integrated in the GTC and do not require administrative authorisation (i.e. as long the requirements are met, the taxpayers may benefit from those tax benefits).
## Free export company status
Agriculture, industry, and telecommunications companies that have an exporting potential amounting to at least 80% of their turnover may qualify for the free export company status.
There are several advantages provided by the GTC for companies that qualify, including a CIT rate of 15%, exemption from the CEL, exemption from registration and stamp duty for incorporation or bylaws change purposes, and exemption from employer tax.
The benefit of this status has been extended until 31 December 2025 by the 2025 Finance Law.
## Miscellaneous incentives
There are a wide range of tax incentives, such as the special economic zone, which is an area designed to host economic activities that have a strong impact on economic growth and that focus their activities on exports (industrial activities, agrobusiness, ICT, tourism, medical services, port activities, and services in general).
Companies established within the zone benefit from a preferential tax regime (a 15% CIT, exemption from taxes and duties at the importation, exemption from CEL, etc.)
There are also some tax benefits for companies involved in the mining and petroleum sector (exemption from the CEL, employer tax, VAT [under conditions], etc.).
