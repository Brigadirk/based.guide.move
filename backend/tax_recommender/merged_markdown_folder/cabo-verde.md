Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Interest payments, in general, are subject to WHT at a rate of 20%.
Bond interest is subject to WHT at the rate of 10%, except bonds and similar financial products (except public debts) duly listed on the stock exchange, which are subject to CIT at the reduced rate of 5%.
Interest on shareholder loans or income from subscription of obligations paid to holding companies is exempt from WHT.
Royalty payments are subject to WHT at the rate of 20%.
Payments of services between resident companies are generally not subject to WHT. Payments of services to non-resident entities are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%, unless waived under the applicable tax treaty.
Rental payments are subject to WHT of 10% when paid or made available by companies. However, rental payments between resident companies are generally not subject to WHT.
For a Cabo Verde-based recipient, tax withheld is a payment on account against the final income tax due regarding income derived from (i) business, commercial, and services activities, (ii) real estate income, and (iii) employment income when the beneficiary of such income opts to file a tax return.
Any non-Cabo Verde resident entity carrying out an economic activity in Cabo Verde is subject to a final WHT at the same rates applicable to each income category foreseen by the Tax Code.
Regarding income paid to micro and small-sized companies, the WHT applicable is 4%.

# Cabo Verde
## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
The Cabo Verde Islands (Cabo Verde), located off the coast of West Africa, became independent on 5 July 1975. Cabo Verde is a representative democracy, with the capital city of Praia accounting for a quarter of its approximately 500,000 citizens. The languages spoken in Cabo Verde are Portuguese and Crioulo, and the currency is the Cabo Verdean escudo (CVE), which is divided into 100 centavos. Since 1998, an exchange agreement between Cabo Verde and Portugal provides a fixed rate between the euro (EUR) and the Cabo Verde escudo as follows: EUR 1 = CVE 110,265.
While Cabo Verde has few natural resources, it is rapidly becoming established as one of the most exciting new markets for tourism development.

# Cabo Verde
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Taxable income is computed on the basis of the accounting income, adjusted by deducting from taxable profits the prior years' losses and any deductions under the tax (incentive) legislation.
## Inventory valuation
The tax law does not foresee any mandatory inventory valuation method that should be adopted by Cabo Verde taxpayers. For tax purposes, accepted inventory methods should be consistent with the accounting rules in force and with generally accepted local business practice. Such methods should be applied in a consistent manner over the financial years and based on the prices effectively paid or established by official documents (for regulated prices).
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to a separate capital gains tax and are treated and taxed as ordinary business income.
Capital gains and capital losses determined for tax purposes are usually different from capital gains and capital losses determined for accounting purposes and are quantified as follows:
Capital gains/losses = sales - (acquisition value - deductible accumulated depreciation - deductible impairment losses) x coefficient
Capital gains can be considered only in 50% of the respective amount if the sales proceeds are reinvested in the acquisition, production, or construction of tangible fixed assets, intangible assets, or non-consumable biological assets. For this purpose, the reinvestment must take place in the previous tax year, in the tax year in which the transfer occurs, or in the two tax years following the transfer.
In case of partial reinvestment, a partial relief (proportional to the investment made) will apply. In case the reinvestment is not fully accomplished during the reinvestment period, the difference (or the proportional difference) will be considered as taxable income of the second year following the disposal, increased by 15%.
Capital gains on the sale of share capital or other equity instruments, owned for a period of not less than 12 months, obtained by a resident or non-resident with a PE in Cabo Verde are exempt from CIT. This benefit does not apply to capital gains on the sale of share capital acquired from entities that are subject to a more favourable tax regime. The exemption also does not apply on capital gains arising on the transfer of shareholdings in a company in which more than 50% of the assets owned are composed, directly or indirectly, of real estate located in Cabo Verde (it includes the gains derived from the respective transfer for a consideration).
Capital gains on the sale of share capital or other securities obtained by non-resident entities without a PE in Cabo Verde are also exempt from CIT. This exemption does not apply on capital gains arising on the transfer of shareholdings in a company in which more than 50% of the assets owned are composed, directly or indirectly, of real estate located in Cabo Verde (it includes the gains derived from the respective transfer for a consideration).
## Dividend income
The tax legislation provides a full relief from taxation on profit distribution at the beneficiary level, without any requirements to be met by the entities involved, except for entities with a local CIT rate reduction, for which the tax relief is only 50%.
## Interest income
There is no special tax provision regarding interest income. Interest income is treated and taxed as ordinary business income (excluding interest from bonds or similar products listed in the securities market).
## Royalty income
The term ‘royalties’ is not defined as such in Cabo Verde’s principal tax law, but the relevant regulations define royalties as “income from intellectual, industrial copyrights, or from an experience acquired in an industrial, commercial, or scientific area, as well as income from technical assistance and from the use of commercial, industrial, or scientific equipment”.
## Foreign income
Resident companies are subject to taxation on foreign income. Cabo Verde tax law allows a foreign tax credit to mitigate the double taxation on foreign income taxed in another jurisdiction (*see Foreign tax credit in the [Tax credits and incentives](cabo-verde/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
PEs of non-resident companies are taxable on a territorial base principle, meaning that income obtained outside Cabo Verde is not subject to taxation therein.

# Cabo Verde
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT system in Cabo Verde closely follows the European Union (EU) VAT system and is assessed at the standard rate of 15%.
The VAT rate on the supply of electricity and water to private consumers is 8%.
The taxable base for the following supplies of goods and services, which price is determined by public authorities, is:
The following transactions are considered to fall outside the scope of VAT:
### Exempt transactions
The VAT regulations establish two types of exempt transactions: exempt transactions without credit and exempt transactions with credit (i.e. zero-rated transactions). VAT incurred is recoverable in as far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of the taxed transactions of a taxable person or for zero-rated transactions.
Exempt transactions without credit include the following:
Exempt transactions with credit (i.e. zero-rated transaction) on imports include the following:
### **Invoicing**
Since June 2021, it has been progressively mandatory to issue electronic invoices.
In recent years, Cape Verden Tax Law has established the concept of 'invoices issued in legal form' that confer the right to deduct input VAT as to foresee only invoices issued electronically.
A self-billing regime has been introduced, ensuring the possibility of the acquirer to issue an invoice in the name or on behalf of the supplier of goods or services, under certain conditions.
### Special VAT regime for e-commerce
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied at rates ranging from 0% to 50% on the customs value of most imported goods.
Raw materials or capital goods can be imported with an exemption from customs duties or at a low rate.
## Special consumption tax
A special consumption tax is imposed at rates ranging from 10% to 150% on goods that are deemed superfluous, luxurious, or undesirable for economic, social, or environmental policy reasons.
Alcoholic beverages produced locally are exempt from the *ad valorem* component, and the fixed component is set for CVE 20 per litre for beer, CVE 30 per litre for wine, and CVE 100 per litre for spirit drinks.
The State Budget Law for 2025 introduces however several new measures:
Vehicles used for transportation, up to 5 tons, are subject to rates of up to 150%, according to their age:
## Carbon Tax
A carbon tax of CVE 550 (approx. € 5) applies to the issuance of commercial passenger air transport tickets at airports and aerodromes in Cabo Verde, as well as to the docking of passenger ships at Cabo Verde's port terminals.
There are some exceptions to its application, namely for air and maritime transport between the islands of Cabo Verde.
## Property taxes
A property tax, called *Imposto Único sobre o Património* (IUP), is levied at the rate of 1.5% in Cabo Verde.
IUP is due on the ownership of immovable property on an annual basis by the owner of the real estate, registered as such on 31 December of the relevant year. The taxable basis corresponds to 25% of the value attributed by the Evaluation Commission.
IUP is also due on the transfer (gratuitously or for a consideration) of real estate, based on the value of the contract declared by the transferee.
Exemption of IUP due on the acquisition is granted to:
In taxable transfers (not exempt), IUP is payable by the transferee.
IUP is also due on the capital gains arising from the sale of:
IUP on capital gains is normally paid by the transferor, on the highest of the declared price and the official value of the property concerned.
Capital gains obtained by companies that are in the business of buying real estate for resale are not subject to IUP.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on a wide variety of transactions and documents, at rates that may be set in specific amounts or on a percentage basis.
Stamp duty rates:
| Item | Stamp duty rate |
| --- | --- |
| Loans | 0.5% |
| Bank interest and fees/commissions | 3.5% |
| Guarantees | 0.5% |
| Insurance | 3.5% |
| Promissory notes, securities | 0.5% |
| Emoluments, registrations acts | 15.0% |
| Contracts | CVE 1,000 \* |
\* Fixed exchange rate € 1 = CVE 100.265 under an exchange agreement between Cabo Verde and Portugal.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (*see below*).
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are payable by the employee on their gross income at a rate of 8.5% and by the employer at 16%.
## Ecologic charge
Cabo Verde's ecologic charge is applied to packing material, whether empty or full, imported or produced internally, non-biodegradable or made out of metal, glass, or plastic.
The ecologic charge varies from CVE 2 to CVE 100 per item, depending on the quantity or weight of the goods.
This fee is due by the local producer or the importer.
Exemptions are available in the case of packing material used in medicine, essential food (e.g. corn, rice, sugar, flour, and milk), and construction (e.g. cement). Packing material that is exported, reutilised, or recycled is also exempt.
## Tourism tax
A tourism tax is applied to accommodation in the hotel sector. The tax amounts to CVE 276 per person per night for people over 16 years of age and cannot exceed ten consecutive nights.

# Cabo Verde
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Taxable period
As a general rule, the tax year is the calendar year. A different tax year may be applied, subject to authorisation from the Ministry of Finance, in the case of non-resident companies with a PE in Cabo Verde and in other situations duly justified by economical reasons.
## Tax returns
Taxpayers are required to file a tax return by 31 May of the year following the end of the tax year in case the tax year corresponds to the calendar year (last day of the fifth month following the end of the tax year in case the tax year is different from the tax year).
## Payment of tax
Corporate taxpayers taxed under the standard regime must make three pre-payments on account of their income tax liability for the current tax year. The pre-payments are due by the end of March, July, and November and amount to 30%, 30%, and 20%, respectively, of the preceding tax year’s income tax liability.
Taxpayers are required to self-assess the tax due by 31 May of the year following the end of the tax year.
Micro and small-size companies are also subject to pre-payments, at a 4% tax rate levied on the annual turnover (sales and services), due by the last day of April, July, October, and January of the following year.
## Tax audit process
There are no specific rules regarding the tax audit cycle in Cabo Verde.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations period in Cabo Verde is of five years.
### Large Taxpayers
Taxpayers that meet at least one of the following criteria qualify as a 'Large Taxpayer' and shall be monitored by the Special Tax Office for Large Taxpayers:

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Non-resident individuals are subject to PIT only on Cabo Verdean-source income at flat tax rates that are the same as those applicable for resident taxpayers.
## Tax methods
Individuals can be taxed under two different tax methods: declarative (self-assessment method) and final withholding method.
### Declarative method
Under the declarative method, individuals are taxed according to their annual income statement. This method is mandatorily applicable to (i) taxpayers taxed under Category B (business and professional income) with standard organised accounting, and (ii) taxpayers taxed under Category C (rental income).
This method is also applicable to dependent workers (Category A) who opt to file the tax return, on the income obtained abroad by resident taxpayers, and on the income obtained in Cabo Verde by non-resident taxpayers that could not be taxed at flat rates.
The total income will be subject to taxation at rates ranging between 16.5% and 27.5%.
### Final withholding method
The final withholding method is applied to collect taxes when taxpayers are not obligated to submit their annual income statement in the following cases: Categories A, D, E, and under the Special Regime for Small and Micro Sized Companies (SRSMC).
Such income is taxable according to the WHT applicable for each category (*see the [Income determination](cabo-verde/individual/income-determination.html) section*).
## Personal income tax rates
The tax rates applicable in the case of the declarative method and on unjustified net wealth increases are the following:
| Taxable income (CVE\*) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 960,000 | 16.5 |
| 960,000 | 1,800,000 | 23.1 |
| 1,800,000 |  | 27.5 |
\* Cabo Verdean escudos
An exemption from taxation applies to net income of up to CVE 220,000 annually.

# Cabo Verde
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Taxable period
As a rule, the tax year coincides with the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
## Tax returns and assessment
The deadline for filing the annual return is 31 March of the following year for taxpayers earning employment and pension income (Category A) who opt to do so (it is not mandatory to file a tax return in this case).
Non-resident individuals do not have the option to file an annual PIT return.
The tax assessment is made by the local tax office.
In the remaining cases in which the declaration-based method is required, taxpayers must compute the tax due and file a tax return by 31 May of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Where WHT is final, there is no further tax liability. Advance WHT is credited against the final tax liability.
Any outstanding tax liability must be paid by 31 August of the year in which the return is due.

# Cabo Verde
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Taxable profit is computed according to the local accounting rules and adjusted for tax purposes.
For the purposes of determining taxable income, CIT payers can be taxed under two methods/regimes as follows:
## Income tax rates
Resident companies are subject to a tax rate of 21%, where taxable income corresponds to the profit less any tax benefits and any losses carried forward, as stated in the tax return. The tax rate of 21% is also applicable for PEs of non-resident companies.
Micro and small-sized companies are subject to a single special tax (SST) of 4% levied on the gross amount of sales obtained in each taxable year, to be paid quarterly. The SST replaces the CIT, fire brigade surtax, and VAT, as well as the contribution to social security attributable to the company.
Non-resident companies without a PE are subject to withholding tax (WHT) rates applicable for each income category foreseen in the Tax Code, which range between 1% and 20%.
## Surcharge
The CIT rate is increased by a fire brigade surcharge, called *Taxa de Incêndio*, of 2% on the tax due, leading to a final tax rate of 21.42%. This surcharge is levied in the municipalities of Praia (Island of Santiago) and Mindelo (Island of São Vicente).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Depreciation
Depreciation is considered a deductible cost with respect to all fixed assets (except land), up to the limits determined by the applicable tax law.
As a general rule, depreciation must be computed by using the straight-line method. Tax authorities may allow other depreciation methods on the basis that the actual depreciation is higher than the one calculated at regular rates or according to the taxpayer's accounting practice.
Under the straight-line method, the maximum depreciation that is deductible is calculated by applying the general depreciation rates set out by the Decree No. 42/2015, of 24 August, to the adjusted purchase cost or production cost.
Land is not depreciable.
### Main depreciation rates for tangible assets
| Group | Asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Property: |  |
| Minor/small buildings | 10 |
| Buildings | 3 to 10 |
| Water reservoirs | 4 to 5 |
| Seals and urban arrangements | 5 to 8.33 |
| 2 | Facilities | 6.66 to 10 |
| 3 | Machinery, equipment, and tools: |  |
| Apparatus and electronic machines | 20 |
| Air condition | 12.5 |
| Laboratory and precision equipment | 14.28 |
| Ventilation equipment | 12.5 |
| Scales | 12.5 to 33.33 |
| Workshop equipment | 12.5 to 20 |
| Machine tools | 12.5 to 25 |
| 4 | Transport materials: |  |
| Aircraft | 20 |
| Boats | 8.33 to 25 |
| Motor vehicles | 12.5 to 20 |
| Tanks | 16.66 |
| 5 | Other tangible fixed assets: |  |
| Movies, records, and audio cassettes | 25 |
| Drawing and typography materials | 12.5 |
| Furniture | 12.5 |
| Molds, dies, shapes, and controls | 25 |
| Computer programs | 33.33 |
### Main depreciation rates for intangible assets
| Asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Installation and expansion costs | 33.33 |
## Goodwill
Goodwill is an asset subject to impairment tests. The goodwill’s impairment is not a deductible cost for tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses include, among others, cost incurred with set-up and organisation of companies, projects, and increase of capital. Start-up expenses are considered a deductible cost up to the limits derived from the applicable tax law, 33.33% per year being deductible over a period of three years.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible if considered indispensable for the realisation of taxable profits/gains (*see Limitation on the tax deductibility of net financing expenses in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are those where the related recovery risk is considered to be justified. According to the CIT Code, the recovery risk is justified whenever there is a:
The deduction for tax purposes of impairment losses on overdue debt is subject to the following limits, computed on the amount of the debt:
| Impairment losses | Delay on payment | Limit (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debt overdue | More than 6 and up to 12 months | 25 |
| More than 12 and up to 18 months | 50 |
| More than 18 and up to 24 months | 75 |
| More than 24 months | 100 |
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions granted to certain entities whose main activity consists of the execution of initiatives in the social, cultural, environmental, scientific or technological, sports, and educational areas are considered as cost for tax purposes (within certain limits, and in certain circumstances, with an additional deduction).
## Fines and penalties
Tax fines and penalties are not deductible for tax purposes. Contractual fines and penalties are deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Taxes paid in connection with the activity of the company are tax deductible, excluding CIT and autonomous taxation. The annual IUP cannot be deducted as a cost for CIT purposes.
## Net operating losses
Income tax losses can be offset against taxable profit, capped at 50% of the taxable profit. Carryback of tax losses is not allowed in Cabo Verde.
According to the transitional regime, tax losses generated before 2015 can be carried forward for three years without limit.
From 2024 onwards, tax losses available can be carried forward for an unlimited period.
The tax losses incurred by a company are not transferable to another company unless previously accepted by the tax authorities.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Currently, there are no special restrictions on the deductibility of royalties, interest, and service fees paid to foreign affiliates, provided that the payments are regarded as indispensable to generate taxable profits and gains and to maintain the business of the company.
Payments made to foreign affiliates located in a favourable tax regime are not accepted as deductible tax costs unless it can be demonstrated that the payment is a necessary cost and is not an exaggerated amount (i.e. it should be demonstrated that it is an acceptable/normal amount).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
The group taxation regime may apply, provided one of the companies directly or indirectly holds at least 75% of the statutory capital of the others and more than 50% of the voting rights.
To be taxed under this regime, the group companies must meet the following conditions:
Additionally, the parent company:
When the regime comes to an end or when one company ceases to qualify for this regime, the tax losses obtained during the regime cannot be carried forward and deducted against future individual taxable income of the companies. The parent company is responsible for demonstrating that the requirements for the application of the group taxation regime are met.
## Transfer pricing
Taxpayers must keep information and documentation regarding their transfer pricing policies on hand. The following taxpayers must prepare a transfer pricing documentation file:
### Country-by-Country (CbC) Report
New transfer pricing reporting obligations have been introduced.
The following entities are required to file the *Declaração financeira e fiscal por país*:
### Communication of the reporting entity
Any entity that is resident in Cabo Verde, or a PE therein of a non-resident, that is part of a multinational group of companies of which an entity is required to file the CbC Report (as foreseen in the CIT Code) is required to file a statement (through electronic means) in which it identifies itself as the reporting entity, or identifying which entity will report the required information (in the latter case, reference should be made to the country of tax residence).
## Limitation on the tax deductibility of net financing expenses
Net financing expenses are only deductible up to the higher of the following limits:
This provision does not apply to public entities, as per Article 68 §5 of the CIT Code.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CIT Code contains specific CFC rules. Profits or income obtained by non-resident entities that are clearly subject to a more favourable tax regime are imputed to the resident taxpayers subject to CIT that hold, either direct or indirectly, even if through a representative, fiduciary, or intermediary, at least 25% of their share capital, voting rights, or attribution rights over the income or the assets of those non-resident entities.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025

# Cabo Verde
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Foreign Investor Status (*Estatuto do Investidor Externo*)
The Foreign Investor Status, which has granted some tax benefits at the level of the investor (e.g. exemption from WHT on distribution of profits and on interest related to the financing of the investment) was revoked by the New Investment Law effective as of 1 January 2013. The tax benefits already granted or for which recognition has been requested prior to the entry into force of the Tax Benefits Code (TBC) and the Investment Code are maintained. Investment projects submitted for analysis and approval to the competent authorities prior to the entry into force of the Tax Benefits Code continue to be regulated under the legislation in force at the date of the respective submission.
## Contractual tax benefits
There are exceptional incentives regarding customs duties, CIT, personal income tax (PIT), property tax, and stamp duty to investments that fulfil all of the following conditions:
The concession of contractual tax benefits is subject to approval by the Council of Ministers upon agreement.
Expenses that, due to insufficient tax due, cannot be deducted in the tax year they were incurred can be carried forward for ten years.
### Eligible taxpayers

An amount corresponding to the application of the rate of 10% of the net increase in eligible equity can be deducted against the taxable profit, capped at CVE 20 million.
The part that exceeds the cap can be carried forward for a period of five years.
The amount of net increases in eligible equity corresponds to the sum of the amounts assessed in the tax year concerned and in each of the nine previous tax periods. In case the net increase in eligible equity is negative, the result is zero.
The following are eligible equity increases:
The net increases in eligible equity correspond to the increases in eligible equity after deducting outflows, in cash or in kind, in benefit of the holders of equity, by way of remuneration or reduction of equity or equity sharing, as well as distributions of reserves or retained earnings.
## Incentive to the reinvestment of profits
An exemption from CIT applies on profits reinvested by technological-based companies duly authorised to operate in the Special Economic Area for Technologies (*Zona Económica Especial para Tecnologias* or ZEET). This includes any company carrying out R&D activities, either internally or in association with third parties, aiming at creating new or improved products, services, and processes.

Alongside the above benefits, for PMDs implemented in municipal areas with a GDP *per capita* lower than the national average, there are the following added benefits:

Direct investment made by emigrants shall benefit from a set of tax incentives, as established by Law 73/IX/2020, of 2 March, namely:
The regime applies to emigrant investors permanently living abroad, as well as to former emigrant pensioners and retired people receiving pensions and similar income from their country of immigration.
The investment on tangible assets or intangibles in Cabo Verde is eligible, under the conditions foreseen in the regime (e.g. the incorporation of entities or branches in Cabo Verde, acquisition of shareholdings, granting of loans or other forms of financing of entities in which a shareholding is held).
## Industrial activity

Eligible investments include the acquisition of new fixed assets, patents, and licences regarding technologies.
### IUP benefits
Industrial activities may benefit from an exemption from IUP on the acquisition of immovable property used exclusively for industrial purposes; however, the recognition of such tax exemption should be approved by the municipality.
### Customs duty benefits
Industrial activities benefit from an exemption from customs duties on the import of construction material, machines, utensils, semi and finished materials, products, and raw materials used in the production of goods.

Entities licensed to operate within the IBC are granted to benefit from reduced CIT rates until 2030.
### Shareholders benefits
Shareholders of the entities licensed to operate within the IBC are exempt from taxation on dividends and interest received.
### VAT and customs duty benefits
An exemption from customs duties applies with respect to certain goods, equipment, and materials used within the scope of the activity developed and licensed under the IBC.
## Maritime transport (tonnage tax)
Cabo Verde tax legislation foresees a special regime for the assessment of the taxable profit applicable to maritime transport activities (tonnage tax).
Entities licensed in the IBC that carry out activities related to the international maritime transport of persons or goods may opt for a special regime for the assessment of the taxable profit, provided that they fulfil the following conditions:
Under the tonnage tax regime, the taxable profit shall be determined by applying the following daily amounts to each eligible ship or vessel:
| Net tonnage | Daily taxable income for each 100 net tonnes (CVE) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 1,000 net tonnes | 646 |
| From 1,001 to 10,000 net tonnes | 566 |
| From 10,001 to 25,000 net tonnes | 307 |
| Above 25,000 net tonnes | 103 |
No deductions are allowed to the taxable profit assessed. The taxable profit assessed is subject to CIT at the rates applicable to entities licensed in the IBC.
No tax credits are available.
In the case of changing from the tonnage tax regime to the general CIT regime, the tax value of the assets held corresponds to the one resulting from the application of the general rules foreseen in the CIT Code, as if the taxpayer had not applied the special regime. Additionally, tax losses or any tax credits carried forward originated during the taxable periods to which the special regime applied are disregarded.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Category A: Employment and pension income
Employment income is specifically defined in the PIT Code and covers all payments in connection with work (employment contract), such as salary, bonuses, commissions, pensions, allowances (e.g. cost-of-living and housing allowances), and benefits in kind (e.g. company cars), regardless of where the payment originates.
Managers or board members’ remuneration is taxed as employment income.
The following types of income are exempt from PIT:
Pensions are also subject to taxation. Pension income below CVE 960,000 is exempt from PIT.
### Withholding tax (WHT)
Employment and pension income are generally subject to monthly WHT.
As a rule, the monthly WHT is levied as final taxation, unless the taxpayer opts to file the tax return, in which case the tax withheld has the nature of an advance payment on account of the final annual income tax liability.
The monthly tax withholdings due are calculated by applying the following progressive WHT rates and the corresponding deduction to the taxable income:
| Bracket | Taxable income (CVE) | | WHT rate (%) | Deduction (CVE) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 1 | 0 | 80,000 | 15 | 5,500 |
| 2 | 80,000 | 150,000 | 21 | 10,300 |
| 3 | 150,000 |  | 25 | 16,300 |
## Category B: Business and professional income
Business and professional income earned by individual entrepreneurs are taxed under the following regimes:
Business and professional income earned by individual entrepreneurs under standard organised accounting are subject to WHT at the rate of 20% as an advance payment on account of the final annual income tax liability.
Net income is computed under the rules applicable to companies with the adjustments provided for in the PIT Code and subject to income tax at the PIT rates applicable.
Net income is computed according to the declaration-based method (*método declarativo*) where tax is levied on the aggregate base of the relevant income categories in the household minus personal deductions and allowances.
Business and professional income earned by individual entrepreneurs under the SRSMC are subject to a flat rate of 4%.
Under this regime, micro and small-sized companies are subject to a Single Special Tax (SST) of 4% levied on the gross amount of sales obtained in each taxable year, to be paid quarterly.
SST replaced the corporate income tax (CIT), fire brigade surtax, and VAT, as well as the contribution to social security due by the company.
Under the PIT Code, it is considered as a Single Act a taxable operation performed twice during the tax year.
## Category C: Rental income
Rental income is subject to WHT at the rate of 20% as an advance payment on account of the final annual income tax liability. To compute the net income, taxpayers may deduct maintenance and repair expenses of up to 30% of gross rental income.
## Category D: Investment income
In general, investment income is subject to a flat rate of 20%; however, some exceptions apply:
## Category E: Capital gains

# Cabo Verde
## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Double economic taxation relief
Taxpayers have the possibility of deducting 50% of the income from dividends in order to partially avoid economic double taxation.
## Non-habitual residents tax regime
A taxpayer who has become a tax resident in Cabo Verde for a certain year and has not been taxed as resident in Cabo Verde for any of the previous five years may apply for the special tax regime for non-habitual tax residents.
A tax exemption applies on foreign-source income (e.g. property income, interest, and dividends), provided certain conditions are met.
A non-habitual resident acquires the right to be taxed as such during a ten-year period.
An application for the non-habitual residents tax regime has to be submitted electronically by 31 March, inclusive, of the year following the one in which the taxpayer became tax resident in Cabo Verde.
## Tax benefits for emigrants
An exemption from taxation applies to income from corporate bonds and treasury certificates, publicly placed and listed in the stock exchange, subscribed and already held by Cabo Verde emigrants.
These workers are allowed the same incentives as foreseen for non-habitual residents. It is required that they remain in the country for a period of more than one year.
