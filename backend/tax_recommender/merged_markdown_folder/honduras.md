# Honduras
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Sales tax
The general sales tax rate is 15%. It applies to most goods and services, with the exception of machinery and equipment, basic grains, pharmaceutical products, raw materials for the production of non-taxable goods, petroleum products, school supplies, and insecticides, among others.
The import and sale of beer, other alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products are subject to 18% sales tax.
There is a 15% sales tax applicable to some PCS, cellular, internet broadband, cable TV, and energy services, depending on the amount of consumption billed by the supplier.
There is an 18% sales tax levied on first class and business class air tickets.
## Customs duties
The duty assessed by the Honduran government at the time of customs clearance ranges between 0% and 15% for most items.
Honduras is a member of the Central American Common Market (CACM), which also includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Honduras’ rates on most goods from outside CACM are currently within the 0% to 15% range. Under the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with the United States (US), about 80% of US industrial and commercial goods can enter the region duty-free, with the remaining tariffs to be phased out over ten years. Nearly all textile and apparel goods that meet the Agreement’s rules of origin are duty-free and quota-free, promoting opportunities for US and regional fibre, yarn, fabric, and apparel manufacturing (the Agreement’s tariff treatment for textile and apparel goods was made retroactive to 1 January 2004).
It is necessary to first obtain the appropriate Harmonized System (HS) classification number for determining when a particular product can enter the CAFTA-DR region duty-free. With this number, it is then possible to check the country and product-specific tariff elimination schedule.
## Excise taxes
There is an excise tax levied on the production and importation of cigarettes, sodas, beer, and alcoholic beverages.
Cigarettes are levied at HNL 600.99 per thousand units.
Excise tax on sodas, beer, and alcoholic beverages are levied according to the following table:
| Description | Tax rate per litre (HNL) |
| --- | --- |
| Soda/other prepared drink | 0.99 |
| Beer | 7.07 |
| Wine | 8.88 |
| Brandy, cognac, vermouth | 47.94 |
| Whisky | 47.94 |
| Rum 40° | 29.19 |
| Rum 38° | 27.73 |
| Rum 36° | 26.27 |
| Gin, vodka, tequila, liquor, creams, prepared beverages | 47.94 |
| Aguardiente 45° | 20.86 |
| Aguardiente 40° | 14.35 |
| Aguardiente 38° | 14.35 |
| Aguardiente 30° | 10.30 |
## Net assets tax
The net assets tax is an annual 1% tax on the net asset value of the company. It applies to the gross value of assets less reserve for accounts payable and any accumulated depreciation allowed under the income tax law and other deductions allowed by law. The law also allows a special deduction of HNL 3 million.
The net assets tax is in lieu of CIT when CIT is less than the amount due for net asset tax. Resident companies during their preoperative period (i.e. the period in which the company started operations but has not issued its first invoice) and companies operating in free trade zones (FTZs), among others, are exempt from the net assets tax.
Non-resident companies are not liable for the net assets tax.
## Transfer taxes
Transfer taxes are levied on real estate transactions at HNL 1.5 per every HNL 1,000.
## Stamp taxes
The stamp taxes in Honduras are regulated by the Stamps and Sealed Paper Law.
## Capital gains tax
The payment of capital gains tax must be made within ten business days after the agreed amount of the transaction has been determined.
In instances where a transaction is subject to the capital gains tax and a non-resident is involved, the buyer has an obligation to withhold 4% of the transaction amount as an advance payment to this tax and must pay it to the government within ten business days of the date of the transaction.
The government offices make a corresponding 10% withholding tax (WHT) on capital gains on payments made due to purchase and sale transactions of goods, indemnifications, purchase of rights, and securities.
## Payroll taxes and contributions
Payroll taxes and contributions are paid by employers at the following rates:
## Special temporary contributions
## Municipal taxes
Companies doing business in Honduras are also subject to the rules and regulations of the respective municipalities. Taxes and obligations are ruled by the '*Plan de Arbitrios*'. Some of these tax obligations include the following:

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The *Servicio de Administración de Rentas* (SAR) is the tax authority in Honduras and is responsible for the administration of the tax system. Taxpayers may request approval from the SAR regarding direct or indirect taxes (e.g. accelerated depreciation methods on new assets acquired by corporations with monetary activities requiring constant technological update, higher installed production capacity and productive re-conversion processes in order to maintain and strengthen their competitive advantage).
## Taxable period
The statutory tax year runs from 1 January through to 31 December. However, taxpayers may apply to use a special tax year by requesting an authorisation from the SAR.
## Tax returns
Companies must file a CIT return on 30 April every year.
## Payment of tax
Mandatory advance tax payments are payable each quarter, based on the income tax paid for the preceding tax year. Final tax is due with the CIT return on 30 April every year.
## Tax audit process
The audit cycle can begin after (i) the date the tax return should have been filed or (ii) sometime after the taxpayer made a request before the tax authority (e.g. tax credit, loss carryforward).
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation for legal actions is applicable for taxpayers, in order to challenge and request payment, and for the fiscal authority, to review, notify, and request payment. Such limitation is established according to the following terms:
Limitation of actions and powers of the fiscal authority will be interrupted according to the following:
Relapse in the lack of complete or partial payment from the taxpayer, as established in the Tax Code, will be considered as criminal tax fraud.
Limitation of the taxpayer to request credit will be interrupted according to the following:
A reclassification of taxpayers was enacted by the tax administration at the beginning of the fiscal year 2023 using the following criteria:
The tax administration provides a number ranking for each criteria, and the total ranking is what determines the classification of the taxpayer as ’major‘, ’medium‘, or ’small‘. This classification is subject to change, and currently the focus of the tax audits are the recently categorised taxpayers as ‘major’ or ‘medium’.

# Honduras
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Honduran resident companies are taxed on territorial income. Non-resident companies are subject to Corporate Income Tax (CIT) only on income derived from Honduran sources.
The CIT rate for a resident company is 25% of its net taxable income.
Foreign entities providing sea, land, and aerial transport services in Honduras should consider a net taxable income equivalent to 10% of their total Honduran-source gross income in order to apply the correspondent income tax rate.
## Minimum tax
Individuals or entities who have obtained gross income greater 1 billion Honduran lempiras (HNL) in the previous fiscal period must pay 1% of the aforementioned income when the application of the indicated rates in Section 22 of the Honduran Income Tax Law are less than 1% of declared gross income.
The rate will be reduced to 0.50% for the following sectors: production, distribution, or commercialisation of cement, steel, and their derivatives for construction, which does not include scrap metal sales or the activity of the mining industry; public services provided by state companies; drugs and pharmaceutical products for human use, at the level of producer, importer, or marketer; and production, commercialisation, or coffee exportations.
## Solidarity Contribution
The Solidarity Contribution is a non-deductible surcharge levied on all companies on taxable income over HNL 1 million. The Solidarity Contribution tax rate is 5%.
## Income tax anti-evasion measures
A law created in response to tax evasion and fraud establishes payment of an income tax of 1% on gross income equal to or greater than HNL 100 million for all taxpayers who report losses for two years in a row or two out of five. The 1% tax paid will be considered as a credit in the resulting income tax, surtax, or net asset payable in the annual returns. There are some exemptions to the rule.
## Municipal income taxes
### Industry, commerce, and services tax
Companies doing business in Honduras are levied the following municipal tax on annual gross income:
| From (HNL) | To (HNL) | Range (HNL) | Tax per ´000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 500,000 | 500,000 | 0.3 |
| 500,001 | 10,000,000 | 9,500,000 | 0.4 |
| 10,000,001 | 20,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 0.3 |
| 20,000,001 | 30,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 0.2 |
| 30,000,001 | And over |  | 0.15 |

Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Honduras, strategically located in the heart of Central America, is bordered by Guatemala to the west, El Salvador to the southwest, Nicaragua to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Honduras is divided into 18 departments. While its political capital is Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula is the industrial capital due to its contribution to the country's economy. The official language of Honduras is Spanish, and the currency is the lempira (HNL).
Honduras is a distribution centre, with Puerto Cortés as the main seaport in Central America. The economy relies heavily on a range of exports, notably apparel, bananas, and coffee. However, it has emerging sectors in agriculture, textile, light manufacturing, sustainable tourism, and business services. The United States-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into force in 2006 and has helped foster investment in this country. The economy expects to register positive economic growth in 2025.

# Honduras
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Income is computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting and commercial principles, subject to certain adjustments required by the tax law.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally valued using the first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), and weighted-average cost methods.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
The income from dividends is considered ‘other income’, thus non-taxable under the general income tax rates. The dividends for resident individuals or entities are subject to a 10% WHT.
There is a 10% WHT rate applicable on the dividends paid to non-residents as well.
Any dividends or distribution of profits that were subject to the corresponding 10% dividend WHT will not be taxed again in case of redistribution.
### Stock dividends
In principle, stock dividends are also not taxable if considered as a capitalisation of the entity. Any transaction should be specifically evaluated.
## Interest income
Honduran Bank interests are subject to a 10% WHT at the moment the interest is given, when the sum is over HNL 50,000. Interests from abroad are considered as other income. For income tax reconciliation, interest income is considered non-taxable when subject to the 10% WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalties are taxed in the same manner as general income if the recipient is a local company or branch. If the recipient is a non-resident, then the application of a WHT will apply.
## Foreign income
Deferral and anti-deferral of foreign income are not regulated in Honduras.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The place of incorporation is regarded by Honduran authorities as the corporate residence. Non-resident companies are companies incorporated/registered outside of Honduras.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
There is a provision in the transfer pricing rules that provides the following definition of PE:
There are some exceptions to the rule.
There is no treaty definition of PE since, at the present time, Honduras is not a signatory of any double taxation treaty (DTT) with another jurisdiction in the world.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The net taxable income of an enterprise is determined by deducting all the ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in the generation of income, including amortisation and depreciation; municipal taxes; donations made in favour of the state, the central district, the municipalities, and legally recognised educational institutions, charities, and sporting facilities; mandatory employer-employee contributions to the social security system; and 'reasonable' charges for royalties and management services.
In general, all expenses incurred in the generation of taxable income are considered as deductible for income tax purposes. However, there are some 'non-deductible' expenses, even if incurred in the generation of income (e.g. interest paid to owners or shareholders, capital losses).
## Depreciation
Depreciation may be computed using the straight-line method. Companies may also obtain authorisation from the tax authorities to use other depreciation methods. However, after a company selects a depreciation method, it must apply the method consistently thereafter. The following are the applicable straight-line method rates for some common assets.
| Asset | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 2.5 to 10 |
| Plant and machinery | 10 |
| Vehicles | 10 to 33 |
| Furniture and office equipment | 10 |
| Tools | 25 |
## Goodwill
Goodwill can be amortised over a period of five years.
## Start-up expenses
Organisation or reorganisation expenses are deductible for the total amount as long as they do not exceed 10% of the initial capital stock. These expenses can be amortised over five years.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible as long as they are incurred in order to generate income. Interest paid to stockholders, owners, or their spouses is not deductible.
## Bad debt
Taxpayers can record a bad debt provision of 1% of the total credit sales, which will not exceed 10% of the accounts receivable balance.
## Charitable contributions
Contributions to organisations legally recognised by the government are deductible.
## Capital losses
## Contingent liabilities
Provisions for contingent liabilities, such as severance pay, are not deductible for tax purposes; actual payments during the fiscal period, for those liabilities, are considered to be deductible expenses.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
With the exception of the Solidarity Contribution, net asset taxes, CIT, and sales tax (i.e. if sales tax paid is used as a credit to net the sales tax payable to the government), taxes and contributions paid to district or municipalities are deductible expenses when determining taxable income.
## Net operating losses
Companies engaged in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and tourism may carry forward losses for three years. However, certain restrictions apply. Losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible as long as the service is effectively received.

# Honduras
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
No provisions exist for group taxation in Honduras.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer Pricing Law was issued by the Honduras National Congress through Decree 232-2011 on 10 December 2011 to regulate every commercial and financial transaction performed between related parties. Transfer Pricing Regulations were later issued by Agreement 027-2015 on 18 September 2015 establishing and expanding the procedures for the application of transfer pricing legislation in Honduras.
The scope of application of this law reaches any operation that is performed between entities domiciled or resident in Honduras with related parties and those under a special regime who enjoy fiscal benefits.
The Honduras tax authority allows taxpayers the request of an Advance Price Agreement (APA) to establish the values for the commercial or financial transactions performed with related parties prior the implementation of such transactions and for a specific time.
### Related parties
For tax effects, it is considered that two or more individuals or legal entities, domiciled or not, are related parties when:
When participation is defined in terms of capital or control over voting rights, a direct or indirect participation of more than 50% will be required in either case.
### Comparability analysis
Comparability, for transfer pricing matters, is known as the analysis of two or more assets (tangible or intangible), services, or similar companies with the purpose of revealing their correlation and likeness and, in this manner, to be able to determine if it is possible to calculate or adjust the material differences that affect their price.
Among the comparability items we should take into account are included the following:
### Selection and hierarchy of the methods to apply the arm’s-length principle
According to Decree 232-2011 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines, to determine if the operations are in accordance with the arm’s-length principle, any of the following methods should be applied:
#### Transactional methods
#### Based on income
Honduras Transfer Pricing Legislation considers the application of a sixth method for goods traded on transparent international markets. Taxpayers may apply methods other than the above-mentioned methods, provided it can be demonstrated that it cannot apply any of the above methods in a reasonable and reliable way to determine the conditions of the free and full arm’s-length principle.
### Range of prices on arm’s length
From the application of any transfer pricing method, one may obtain a range of prices whenever there exists two or more comparable transactions. These methods will be adjusted through the application of statistic methods, among them can be included the use of the interquartile range. Other statistic methods may be used in the frame of an amicable proceeding.
### Taxpayer’s obligations
Income taxpayers that are related parties and perform commercial and financial transactions among them have the obligation to:
\* Multinational group entities tax residents in Honduras.
\* The component entities, other than the Ultimate Parent, that for tax purposes reside in Honduras.
a.Income
b.Results before Taxes and Income Taxes
c.Declared Capital and Undistributed Profits
d.Number of Employees and Tangible Assets:
e.The report must be submitted in accordance with the Annex to agreement SAR-653-2023 in Excel (XML) format, within 12 months following the close of the fiscal year.
## Thin capitalisation
At the present time, there are no provisions for thin capitalisation in Honduras.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
At the present time, there are no provisions in the Honduras legislation for CFCs.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Companies operating under a special tax regime are exempted from CIT, sales tax, customs duties, and some municipal taxes. These special tax regimes are the following:
Companies must comply with some governmental requirements to operate under one of the above-mentioned special regimes.
Companies under special tax regimes are allowed to sell their partial or total production in the local market; income from local sales will be subject to the regular corporate tax regulations.
The term of tax exoneration is limited to 12 years to those companies under special tax regimes with no specific term for their tax benefits specified in their corresponding resolution issued by the government.
The Law for the Promotion and Protection of Investment (*Ley para la Promoción y Protección de las Inversiones*) was amended, establishing a 15-year term for tax stability agreements, except for Public and Private Alliances projects. At the same time, it repeals the special income tax discounts granted by this law.
Special benefits exist for industries that import semi-manufactured materials for assembly in Honduras and export finished products. Benefits consist of duty-free imports of raw materials for subsequent export as manufactured products. Machinery for these industries may also be imported duty-free.
## Foreign tax credit
There are no provisions for foreign tax credits in Honduras.
