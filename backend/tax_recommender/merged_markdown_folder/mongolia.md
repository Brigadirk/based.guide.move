# Mongolia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Mongolia, a landlocked country in north-central Asia, is bordered by China and Russia. The country is known for its vast, rugged expanses and nomadic culture. The country is a vibrant democracy and has experienced remarkable economic growth, tripling its gross domestic product per capita in real terms over the past 30 years. With a young and highly literate population and abundant natural resources, Mongolia holds tremendous economic growth potential. The nation is divided into 21 provinces, with Ulaanbaatar as its capital. The official language is Mongolian, and the national currency is the Mongolian tugrik (MNT).
Historically, Mongolia's economy was primarily based on agriculture. Today, it is rich in mineral resources and is recognised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as one of 29 resource-rich developing countries. The principal reserves mined in Mongolia include coal, copper, and gold. The mining sector is expected to grow further, driven by rising commodity prices, foreign investment, and Mongolia’s strategic proximity to China, a major global consumer of mining products.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Mongolian corporate income tax (CIT) is levied using a progressive rate scale, as follows:
However, certain types of income, as detailed in the chart below, are excluded from the calculation of annual taxable income and are taxed at different rates on a gross basis:
| Source of income | Applicable tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends | 10 |
| Royalties | 10 |
| Interest | 10 |
| Gambling, betting games, and lotteries (net) | 40 |
| Sale of immovable property | 2 |
| Sale of rights (e.g. mining licences, special activity licences, and other rights granted by the authorised organisations for conducting specific activities) | 10 |
A special 5% tax rate will apply to dividend and interest income for investors who purchase debt instruments or shares of a local entity (excluding those holding mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining special licences) traded on local and international stock markets.
Entities with annual revenue up to MNT 300 million will submit CIT returns on an annual basis and will be taxed at a rate of 1%. This rate does not apply to entities operating in the mining, petroleum, alcoholic beverage, and tobacco industries.
## Ultimate beneficial owner (UBO)
Under the General Taxation Law (GTL), the UBO for tax purposes is defined as a person who owns 30% or more of the shares, ownership interest, or voting rights in a legal entity holding a mining or petroleum licence or land-use (or possession) rights, either directly or indirectly through a chain of legal entities; exercises voting rights; or has the right to receive dividends. Concurrently, the concept of a 'right holder' is introduced, defined as a person who possesses a mineral, radioactive minerals, and petroleum exploration or mining licence or land-use (or possession) rights.
The taxpayer (the right holder) must register its UBO for tax purposes with the tax authorities. If there is a change in the UBO, the taxpayer must notify the authorities within 30 days.
If the UBO's share ownership in the licence-holding company changes due to the sale or transfer of shares, the transaction is considered an 'indirect sale/transfer of rights' and is subject to CIT in Mongolia. Importantly, the tax obligation falls on the legal entity holding such rights, not on the person who earns income from the transaction.
### Assessing taxable income
In general, taxable income shall be assessed based on the value of rights pro-rated to the number of shares or percentage of participation that are transferred from a right-holding entity or its UBOs. For the purpose of certainty, the Ministry of Finance passed the Decrees No. 303 and 302, dated 31 December 2019, which set the following methodologies to assess taxable income:
In general, taxable income is assessed based on the value of rights proportional to the number of shares or the percentage of participation transferred from a right-holding entity or its UBOs. To ensure clarity, the Ministry of Finance issued Decrees No. 303 and 302, dated 31 December 2019, establishing the following methodologies to assess taxable income:
### Penalties
Breach of the above-mentioned legislative requirements (including failure to properly assess taxes, failure to report relevant information, or concealing documents and information, as well as providing false documentation for tax purposes) may result in the cancellation of the respective rights, such as mining licences and/or land-use or possession rights.
## Local income taxes
CIT is levied at the state level in Mongolia. There are no provincial or local corporate income taxes.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
According to the VAT Law, any person (including legal entities, individuals, and PEs) whose sales income reaches MNT 50 million or more within 12 consecutive months must register as a VAT withholder. The threshold for voluntary registration is MNT 10 million in sales income. The sale of fixed assets is not considered when determining VAT registration thresholds.
A VAT rate of 10% is imposed on the supply of goods, services, and works that are imported, exported, or sold in Mongolia.
A distinctive feature of Mongolian VAT legislation is that services and works received from a non-resident, regardless of whether they are supplied in Mongolia or not, are subject to VAT under the reverse-charge procedure (RC VAT).
## Customs duty
Customs tariffs in Mongolia range between 5% and 40%, depending on the type of goods imported. However, certain items, such as gas condensate, petroleum oils, crude oils, oils obtained from bituminous minerals, automatic data processing machines, electrical machinery and equipment and their parts, medical equipment, and pure-bred livestock, are zero-rated.
Export duties apply to specific exported goods, including unprocessed camel wool, wood, and wooden materials.
## Excise tax
Excise tax is levied on goods manufactured in or imported into Mongolia, including tobacco, alcohol, gasoline, diesel fuel, and passenger vehicles. Additionally, excise tax is imposed on the physical units of special-purpose technical devices and equipment used for betting games and gambling, as well as on the activities of individuals and legal entities conducting such activities.
Currently, the excise tax rates on goods such as alcohol and tobacco vary. For instance, the tax is MNT 350 per litre for Shimiin arkhi (a traditional Mongolian alcoholic drink) distilled using a production method, and MNT 4,180 per 100 cigarettes of tobacco. For other types of alcoholic beverages, the excise rate varies based on the alcohol content and is set to progressively increase over the next few years.
| **Beverage types** | Excise **rate/litre (minimum-maximum range in MNT)** | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2023-2024** | **2025-2026** | **2027-2027** | **2029 onwards** |
| All types of white alcohol, liqueurs, cordials, and other spirits drinks | 3,700-31,300 | 3,900-34,450 | 4,100-37,900 | 4,300-41,690 |
| All types of brandy, whiskey, rum, and gin | 9,100-38,280 | 9,600-44,000 | 10,100-50,600 | 10,600-58,200 |
For special-purpose technical devices and equipment used for betting games and gambling, the excise tax ranges from MNT 4.35 million to MNT 116 million per unit, depending on the origin and type of equipment.
For imported gasoline and diesel, the excise tax rates range from MNT 0 to MNT 850,000, depending on the port of import.
For imported automobiles, the excise tax varies between MNT 750,000 and MNT 65,975,000, based on the year of production, type of automobile, and engine capacity.
## Immovable property tax (IPT)
The IPT is an annual tax that ranges from 0.6% to 2%, depending on factors such as location, usage, size, market demand, and supply conditions of the property. The exact tax rate within this range is determined by the Citizens' Representatives Khurals of the Aimag and Capital City, considering the location, designation, size, market needs, and requirements of the property.
The tax is levied on the value of immovable property as reported in state registration records. If the property is unregistered, the insured value is used. In the absence of both a registered and insured value, the accounting value is utilised.
This tax does not apply to properties owned by legal entities financed through the state budget, dwelling houses, or buildings and constructions of a public nature. Other tax-exempt properties include:
## Transfer taxes
In the case of transfer of property, stamp duty will be applied.
## Stamp duty
Under the Law of Mongolia on State Stamp Duties, there are 45 types of activities subject to stamp duties, including the following:
The amount of the duty varies depending on the type of service or activity involved.
## Social insurance contribution by employer
Employers’ social insurance contributions in Mongolia vary depending on the industry type and the job positions of the employees, ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%. This contribution includes 8.5% for pensions, 1% for benefits, 2% for health, 0.2% for unemployment, and 0.8% to 2.8% for industrial accident and occupational disease insurance. Employer contributions are not capped and are deductible when determining taxable income.
Employers are also required to withhold social insurance taxes from employees, generally at a rate of 11.5%. This amount will be capped at MNT 910,800 per month if an employee’s income exceeds MNT 7,920,000 after 1 April 2025, reflecting the increase in the minimum wage from MNT 660,000 to MNT 792,000. Employers must submit social insurance returns electronically and by paper before the fifth day of the following month on a monthly basis. Payments should be made to the social insurance fund account before the end of the month.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to social insurance contributions, employers in Mongolia are subject to payroll taxes. Employers are required to withhold PIT from employees' employment income at progressive rates of 10% to 20% for Mongolian tax residents and a flat rate of 20% for tax non-residents. Employers must submit PIT returns electronically on a quarterly basis.
## Fees and taxes applicable to the extractive industry
A range of fees and other taxes are payable for activities in the extractive industry. The primary ones include the following:

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Companies must submit a quarterly or semi-annual return by the 20th day of the month following the end of each respective period and an annual return by 10 February after the end of the tax year.
A withholder must prepare and submit a WHT return on a quarterly basis by the 20th day of the first month of the following respective period and an annual return by 10 February after the end of the tax year.
## Payment of tax
A taxpayer shall pay the taxes due in advance by the 25th day of each month in accordance with the payment schedule based on the previous year. However, the tax authorities practically do not use their right to establish the payment schedule, and the tax payment deadline is the same as the tax reporting deadline. Year-end settlement is made by 10 February of the following year (along with the annual tax statement).
In practice, the Mongolian tax authorities allow concessions as follows:
In instances where the total tax remitted exceeds the tax obligation, the surplus amount may be applied as a credit toward settling other outstanding taxes or future tax liabilities. Additionally, there is a potential for the overpaid amount to be refunded.
An economic entity or organisation that has withheld tax from a payment of dividends, royalties, sale of rights, or a payment of income to a taxpayer should transfer the WHT to the tax authorities within ten working days. Tax withheld relating to the sale of immovable property should be transferred to the tax authorities within ten working days.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit process is based on a risk-based system. Hence, there is no pre-defined cycle. However, the regular cycle in Mongolia is up to four years in practice due the statute of limitation period of four years. The tax audit is also conducted if the company requests a tax refund from tax authorities or liquidates its company. Moreover, a tax audit can be conducted anytime if the tax authorities suspect some risk or misuse of the legislation or receive information from a trustworthy source about tax evasion.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Mongolia is four years for tax arrears, fines, and penalties. However, the dispute settlement timeframe shall not pertain to payment of tax, fine, and penalty debts.
The tax authorities typically concentrate on issues such as the understatement of income, overstatement of expenses, and the withholding obligations of taxpayers. In this context, they are particularly vigilant in scrutinising cross-border transactions between related parties.
Another prominent issue in Mongolia currently is transfer pricing. The concept of transfer pricing became more comprehensive in 2020, with the introduction of detailed rules designed to align with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Specifically, the regulations now include a list of controlled transactions, prescribed transfer pricing methods, requirements for transfer pricing documentation, and a detailed comparability analysis, all based on the OECD guidelines.
PE is also emerging as a key area of focus for the tax authorities. Although it is possible for PEs to be registered as taxpayers, the determination of taxable income for PEs remains an area of uncertainty.

## Tax returns and payments
In general, if an employee (local or expatriate) receives employment income from a Mongolian employer, the responsibility for reporting, withholding, and payment lies with that employer. If an employee receives other income (e.g. income from the sale of shares) or if there is no Mongolian employer, the responsibility for reporting, withholding, and payment lies with the employee.
The tax agent (i.e. employer) should transfer the tax withheld from a taxpayer’s income to the budget by the tenth day of the following month.
Furthermore, a tax agent should submit a quarter-to-date report of tax withheld by the 20th day of the first month of the following quarter and year-to-date tax report by 15 February of the following year to the corresponding tax authority.
Income should be reported on an individual tax form and submitted to the tax authority by 15 February of the following year.

# Mongolia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
In Mongolia, a resident entity is subject to CIT on its worldwide income, unless the income is specifically exempt. CIT applies to all taxable income and capital gains, at various rates dependent on the type of income and gains.
Non-resident corporations are taxed in Mongolia on their income earned in Mongolia or sourced from Mongolia (from which the income provider entity in Mongolia should withhold taxes), as well as income from a Mongolian source arising through a PE in Mongolia.
Mongolian-source income is defined in the CIT Law as including:
## Inventory valuation
There is no specific provision in the tax law for inventory valuation, but a loss incurred from inventory revaluation is not deductible from taxable income.
## Capital gains
Capital and ordinary transactions are treated in the same way for tax purposes (i.e. included in annual taxable income). An exception is provided for income from sales of immovable property, which is subject to tax of 2% on gross sales proceeds.
A non-resident taxpayer’s income earned in Mongolia or from a Mongolian source is taxed in Mongolia. The definition of Mongolian-source income includes income from a sale or transfer of asset and associated rights in Mongolia (including shares). Such income is taxed with a 20% withholding tax (WHT) on a gross basis.
Obligations for withholding, reporting, and paying such tax rests with a Mongolian resident taxpayer who provides such income to a non-resident. However, in absence of this agent (i.e. in case a transaction is done between two non-residents), a non-resident-seller should be responsible for tax reporting and payment of a Mongolian WHT on a self-assessment basis.
## Dividend income
Dividend income earned by a Mongolian resident entity is subject to WHT of 10% if the recipient is a Mongolian resident taxpayer. Dividend income to be remitted out of the country to a foreign tax resident is subject to WHT at 20% but may be reduced by an applicable double tax treaty (DTT).
There is a special provision for investors who have purchased shares of a local entity (excluding those holding licences for mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining) traded in both local and international stock markets. In such cases, the dividend income is subject to a reduced WHT rate of 5%.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to a special income tax of 10% if the recipient is a Mongolian resident taxpayer. For interest income remitted out of the country to a foreign tax resident, the WHT rate is 20%, which may be reduced by an applicable DTT.
A special 5% rate applies on interest income of an investor who purchased debt instruments issued by a Mongolian commercial bank and debt instruments of a local entity (not holding mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining special licences) traded in local and international stock markets.
## Rental income
Rental income is included in taxable income for tax determination.
## Royalty income
Generally, royalty income is taxed at a special rate of 10% if the recipient is a Mongolian resident taxpayer. Royalty income to be remitted out of the country to a foreign tax resident is subject to WHT at 20% but may be reduced by an applicable DTT.
A special 5% rate applies on software license fee and server renting fee income transferred to a non-resident legal entity by a resident taxpayer in Mongolia that is engaged in primary activities of software development**.**
## Partnership income
There is no transparent partnership concept in Mongolia. Partnership income is treated as income of a legal entity and is subject to CIT.
## Unrealised currency exchange gains/losses
Unrealised currency exchange gains are not considered as taxable income, and, at the same time, unrealised losses are not deductible from taxable income.
## Exempt income
Tax exempt income includes:
## Foreign income
Mongolian legal entities pay tax on their worldwide income. Unremitted earnings are taxed the same as ordinary earnings.
Credit relief is available for foreign taxes paid on income from countries that have information exchange agreements with the Mongolian tax authorities. This relief is capped at the amount of Mongolian tax that would have been payable on the same income if it had been earned in Mongolia.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
There have been multiple additions and amendments to the tax legislation promulgated by Mongolian Parliament as follows:
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
To stimulate economic activity, a series of tax incentives were introduced in 2023 and 2024. These incentives were specifically designed to encourage businesses to:
Commencing on 1 July 2024, a series of modifications were enacted for the securities issued by the government, provinces, capital city, and resident taxpayers that are traded on the primary and secondary domestic stock markets. These changes include the following:
The amount of the CIT credit shall not exceed 1% of the taxable income for the relevant tax year. It is expected that requirements and standards for the development projects, activities, and operations eligible for the CIT credit will be approved and monitored by the responsible ministries.
In connection with the previously mentioned CIT credit introduction, the following expenses shall not be deductible from taxable income:
## Customs tariffs, customs duties, and value-added tax (VAT)
From June 2024, the government is entitled to extend the payment period of customs duties and VAT for up to four years, or to allow partial payments over a four-year period, for imported building materials and equipment used in the following major projects:
## Real estate income tax
## Revision of the Asset Valuation Act
The revision of the Law on Asset Valuation was approved by the Parliament on 17 June 2022, and it is effective from 1 January 2023. This revised legislation incorporates the principle of asset valuation for taxation purposes. In alignment with this objective, the Ministry of Finance is assigned to promulgate the procedural guidelines and standard methodology for the valuation of assets for tax considerations. However, the guidelines have not been issued yet.
## Law on Minerals
On 19 April 2024, a new law pertaining to the National Treasury Fund was introduced. This law brought about amendments to several existing laws, including the Law on Minerals and the CIT Law.
The recent amendments to the Law on Minerals now prohibit any entity, whether acting independently or in conjunction with affiliated parties, from owning more than 34% of the total issued shares in a legal entity that holds a licence for a strategically important deposit. The only exceptions to this rule are legal entities that have signed an Investment Agreement with the Government of Mongolia or state-owned entities.
Furthermore, the amendments to the CIT Law impose a tax rate of 30% if the beneficial owner of a mining licence for a strategically important mineral deposit transfers, either fully or partially, the right to own and use land, as well as exploration and exploitation licences for minerals, radioactive minerals, and oil. Such transfers may occur through the gifting or bequeathing of shares, participation, or voting rights in a legal entity.

## Accrued expenses
## Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are not deductible.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of fixed assets and amortisation of intangibles are deductible within the limits provided in tax legislation. A straight-line method is used, and the years of usage are determined for tax purposes.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Building and construction / Land improvements | 40/25 |
| 2 | Machinery and equipment | 10 |
| 3 | Computer, computer parts, and software | 2 |
| 4 | Intangible asset with defined useful life (includes licence for mineral exploration and extraction) | Period in force |
| 5 | Other non-current asset | 10 |
A taxpayer not holding minerals, radioactive minerals, oil exploration, and mining licences can depreciate its newly built property in Baganuur, Bagakhangai, and Nalaikh districts of the capital city and other aimags and soums from 1 January 2023 for 15 years on a straight-line basis by its own choice.
## Goodwill
There is no specific provision in the tax law regarding the deductibility of goodwill.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisational and start-up expenses are deductible if they meet the requirements for deductible expenses.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible. However, there are limits with respect to the deductibility of interest expense. *See Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*.
## Bad debt
Bad debt provisions are not deductible. There is no clear guidance in the tax legislation as to whether bad debt is deductible or not; however, in practice, the tax authorities disallow deductibility of bad debt.
## Charitable contributions
In connection with the CIT credit (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*), the following expenses shall not be deductible from taxable income:
## Pension expenses
Compulsory pension insurance premiums paid to the Social Security Authority of Mongolia are deductible. Additional voluntary insurance premiums are deductible but shall not exceed 15% of taxable income.
## Payment for directors
If a payment for directors is a salary payment on which social insurance and PIT is levied, it is considered as deductible.

Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are not deductible. Per anti-corruption law, monetary amounts involved with respect to such payments will be confiscated and criminal proceedings will be instituted.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Certain taxes paid by a taxpayer, as well as social contributions of employers, are generally deductible for tax purposes.
## Tax losses
Tax losses generally may be carried forward for up to four years. However, the annual amount of carried forward losses deductible from taxable income may not exceed 50% of the taxable income in the tax year.

# Mongolia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
There are no rules permitting grouping for tax purposes in Mongolia.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing provisions in Mongolia are governed by the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Law and the General Tax Law (GTL). Starting from 2020, Mongolia introduced comprehensive transfer pricing rules designed to align with the guidelines developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These rules apply to both domestic and cross-border transactions.
The GTL provides an updated definition of 'related parties', which is referable in all tax relationships and broadly involves persons who can influence terms of transactions and their economic outcome between each other directly or indirectly, by involvement in assets, control, and managerial activities. This general definition includes also specific examples of related parties, but it is not exhaustive.
If conditions of the controlled transactions (transactions between the related parties) are different from conditions of independent transactions (transactions between the unrelated parties) and the tax base has been reduced because of these differences, the tax base shall be increased by the differences of such reduced amount, and relevant reassessed tax shall be levied. Transfer pricing rules apply to all related party transactions, including domestic and cross-border transactions.
Beginning from 2020, the Mongolian tax authorities also introduced rules strengthening the reporting requirements for transactions between related parties. Under these reporting requirements, in particular, all foreign invested and affected domestic entities will need to submit the transactional transfer pricing report, the local file, and master file alongside the annual CIT return. In addition, the qualifying entities will need to submit the country-by-country (CbC) report.
New amendments imposed severe administrative penalties for the failure of transfer pricing documentation requirements, and these administrative penalties are equal to 2% to 4% of a transaction value, apart from penalties and fines resulting from transfer pricing adjustments.
## Thin capitalisation
The CIT Law includes the following thin capitalisation rules:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC rules were introduced from 2020, which define as a CFC a foreign entity in which a related party (i.e. a Mongolian tax resident, an individual permanently residing in Mongolia) holds 50% or more of the number of shares or voting rights of a foreign entity during any period of the current tax year directly or through one or more legal entities in the chain.
For taxation purposes, a CFC is treated as a Mongolian tax resident, but these rules shall not apply to a CFC that is established for IPO purposes.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Establishing a branch of a foreign company is theoretically possible but not practically feasible, as, under Mongolian law, there are no regulations detailing the establishment procedure. Consequently, there are currently no branches of non-resident companies in Mongolia.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
At present, the following types of incentives exist:
This excludes taxpayers holding minerals, radioactive minerals, oil exploration, and mining licence.
## Foreign investment incentives
The Law on Investment provides tax incentives, including exemptions from tax, tax credits, possibility to use accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, tax loss carryforward, and deduction of employee training costs from taxable income.
### Tax stabilisation
The Law on Investment also provides a 'stabilisation certificate' in order to create a more stable tax environment in Mongolia. By obtaining a stabilisation certificate, investors can stabilise applicable rates of the following taxes:
The holder of a stabilisation certificate can stabilise tax rates for a period from 5 to 18 years, depending on amount of investment, industry of investment, and geographic location of investment in Mongolia (*see Stabilisation certificate terms below*). Under the valid period of a stabilisation certificate, investors also have the right to apply effective tax rates provided in general legislation if such rates are more beneficial for investors.
The criteria of issuing a stabilisation certificate are:
An investor who made an investment in tobacco and alcohol related activities cannot benefit from tax stabilisation.
If certain conditions are met, the stabilisation certificate period may be extended by 1.5 times for some projects.
The conditions are that the projects:
In addition to above, the law provides for incentives with respect to customs duty (exemption) and VAT (zero-rate) on imported equipment and machinery during the construction period of specific projects, as below:
#### Stabilisation certificate terms
For the mining, heavy industry, and infrastructure sectors, a stabilisation certificate is issued as follows:
| Investment amount (MNT in billions) | Stabilisation certificate terms (years) | | | | | Period within which investment must be made (years) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ulaanbaatar Region | Central Region (Gobisumber, Dornogobi, Dundgobi, Darkhan-Uul, Umnugobi, Selenge, Tuw) | Khangai Region (Arkhangai, Bayankhongor, Bulgan, Orkhon, Uwurkhangai, Khuwsgul) | Eastern Region (Dornod, Sukhbaatar, Khentii) | Western Region (Bayan-Ulgii, Gobi-Altai, Zawkhan, Uws, Khowd) |

| more than 500 | 15 | 16 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 5 |
For any other sector, a stabilisation certificate is issued as follows:
| Investment amount (MNT in billions) | | | | | Stabilisation certificate terms (years) | Period within which investment must be made (years) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ulaanbaatar Region | Central Region (Gobisumber, Dornogobi, Dundgobi, Darkhan-Uul, Umnugobi, Selenge, Tuw) | Khangai Region (Arkhangai, Bayankhongor, Bulgan, Orkhon, Uwurkhangai, Khuwsgul) | Eastern Region (Dornod, Sukhbaatar, Khentii) | Western Region (Bayan-Ulgii, Gobi-Altai, Zawkhan, Uws, Khowd) |

| 100 to 200 | 50 to 100 | 40 to 80 | 30 to 60 | 25 to 50 | 10 | 4 |
| more than 200 | more than 100 | more than 80 | more than 60 | more than 50 | 15 | 5 |
## Free Trade Zones (FTZs)
### Establishing FTZs
Currently, there are three FTZs established at the border towns of Altanbulag, Zamyn-Uud, and Tsagaan Nuur.
FTZs have special regimes in terms of tax, customs, transit, state registration, foreign currency, specialised inspection, and visa and labour regulations. Companies registered in FTZs should commence their operations within a year after their registration; otherwise, their registration will be suspended.
### Tax and customs regime
#### CIT
Businesses that have invested 500,000 United States dollars (USD) or more in the FTZs operating to improve infrastructures, such as energy and heating sources, pipeline networks, clean water supplies, wastewater sewage, auto roads, railways, airports, and basic communication lines, shall receive a CIT discount equal to 50% of their invested capital in the FTZ.
For businesses with more than USD 300,000 invested in building warehouses, loading and unloading facilities, hotels, tourist camps, or manufacturers of export and import-substituted goods in the FTZ shall receive a CIT discount equal to 50% of their invested capital in the FTZ.
Loss-making entities in the FTZs can carry forward their losses reflected on their CIT return up to five years from the time of becoming fully operational to reduce their future tax payable.
Entities using innovated and enhanced technology in their businesses shall be fully exempted from CIT for the first five years from the time of starting operation in the FTZs.
#### VAT
There will be no VAT imposed on goods and services manufactured and sold by registered individuals and businesses in the FTZs.
#### Customs and excise taxes
Goods exported from the FTZs are not subject to taxation.
#### Land payments and property taxes in the FTZ
Individuals and businesses may request a land possession and usage right in the FTZs through either project bid or auction.
Entities operating in trade, tourism, and hotel sectors in the FTZs are fully exempted from land possession and usage right payment for the first five years from commencement of operation. This payment is further reduced up to 50% for the following three years.
Businesses operating to improve infrastructures in the FTZs, such as energy and heating sources, pipeline networks, clean water supplies, wastewater sewage, auto roads, railways, airports, and basic communication lines, will be fully exempted from land payment for the first ten years from start of operation.
Buildings and facilities built and registered in the FTZs are fully exempted from the immovable property tax.
## Foreign tax credit
A provision exists for a foreign tax credit, applicable to taxes remitted to foreign jurisdictions. This credit is limited to the equivalent tax liability that would have been assessed in Mongolia on the same income. Furthermore, upon meeting certain prerequisites, taxes paid in foreign countries that are party to information exchange agreements with Mongolian tax authorities may be eligible for credit. This credit can be applied against tax liabilities in Mongolia, thereby mitigating the potential for double taxation.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
To align with international tax standards and mitigate income disparity, the Parliament has sanctioned the implementation of a progressive PIT rate. This rate, applicable to salaries, wages, equivalent income, and indirect income, took effect from 1 January 2023.
## Minimum wage
In accordance with Resolution No. 3, dated 7 October 2024, issued by the National Tripartite Committee on Labour and Social Consensus, the minimum wage has changed to 4,714 Mongolian tugrik (MNT) per hour or MNT 792,000 per month effective as of 1 April 2025.
## Social insurance
On 7 July 2023, the Parliament of Mongolia passed the General Law on Social Insurance (GLSI), which will replace the existing Law on Social Insurance (1994) effective as of 1 January 2024. Significant changes are related to the social insurance rates and scope, specifically the reduction of the rate for industrial accidents and occupational diseases and increase of the rate for unemployment.
The monthly cap of the employee’s social insurance contribution has changed to MNT 910,800 effective as of 1 April 2025.
