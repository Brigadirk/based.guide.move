## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
A 12% VAT is levied on the sale or transfer of merchandise and on non-personal services rendered or effected in Guatemala. The tax is payable to the government by way of the invoice method, whereby the tax charged to the customers is offset by the VAT paid over purchases, and the government collects the net resulting amount. The issuance and circulation of credit titles is VAT-exempt.
### Sale of goods
The taxable amount on the sale of goods includes the sales price, less any discounts provided under sound commercial practices, plus other charges shown on the invoice.
### Services
The taxable amount of services includes the price of the service, less any discounts provided under sound commercial practices, plus financial charges and products used to render the services.
### Imports and leases
The tax base for imports is the value declared for import duties computation purposes.
The tax base for leases of movable or immovable property is the value of the lease.
### Exempted sales and services
The following items are exempt from VAT:
- Banking institution services and their agents.
- The issuance, circulation, and transfer of credit bonds, value bonds, and stocks of any kind.
- Interest accrued by credit bonds and other obligations issued by mercantile partnerships, negotiated through an authorised stock exchange.
- Exports of goods and services.
- Contributions and donations to educational, cultural, assistance, or security service partnerships, constituted as not-for-profit entities.
### VAT return
The amount payable to the *Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria* (SAT), Guatemala’s tax authority, is the difference between the debits and credits accrued during the tax period (one month) and is paid monthly by filing a tax return in the calendar month following the end of each tax period.
### Refunds of VAT
The VAT credit can be claimed on monthly, quarterly, or semiannual tax periods. The refund of VAT credit corresponds to exporter taxpayers who cannot offset the VAT credit with VAT debits.
In addition, the VAT credit can be claimed by those taxpayers who have a high percentage of sales to entities exempt from VAT.
## Import duties
The import duties apply to the customs value declared by the importer.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are applicable to specific activities, such as fuel distribution tax, alcohol and beverages distribution tax, and tobacco distribution tax.
### Fuel distribution tax
| Product | GTQ per gallon |
| --- | --- |
| Premium fuel | 4.7 |
| Regular fuel | 4.6 |
| Aviation fuel | 4.7 |
| Diesel/gal oil | 1.3 |
| Kerosene (DPK) | 0.5 |
| Avjet turbo fuel | 0.5 |
| Naphtha | 0.5 |
| Petroleum liquid gas | 0.5 |
### Alcohol and beverages distribution tax
| Product | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Beers | 6.0 |
| Other fermented cereal drinks | 6.0 |
| Wines | 7.5 |
| Sparkling wines | 7.5 |
| Vermouth wines | 7.5 |
| Ciders | 7.5 |
| Distilled alcoholic beverages | 8.5 |
| Alcoholic mixed beverages | 7.5 |
| Fermented drinks | 7.5 |
### Tobacco distribution tax
Tobacco distribution tax is 100% of the factory selling price of a 10-pack package.
## Real estate taxes
Real estate taxes are assessed annually at GTQ 2 per thousand on declared property values from GTQ 2,000 to GTQ 20,000, at GTQ 6 per thousand on values from GTQ 20,000 to GTQ 70,000, and at GTQ 9 per thousand on values in excess of GTQ 70,000 (e.g. property valued at GTQ 1 million will pay real estate taxes of GTQ 9,000).
## Transfer of property
VAT is payable on the first sale of real estate, and subsequent sales are taxed under the stamp tax regime.
## Stamp taxes
Other than sales invoices, contracts, and documents subject to VAT, and other minor exemptions, a stamp tax must be paid on all documents covering commercial and legal transactions (e.g. collection of dividends), either by preparing the document on *papel sellado*, which is special stamped paper, or by affixing stamps on the documents. This tax is also assessed on documents issued abroad, other than drafts or promissory notes and commercial invoices from foreign suppliers. Letters of credit and acceptances involving international transfers of funds are generally exempt from stamp taxes.
The normal tax rate is 3% and is calculated on the face value of the documents or on the gross value of the related transaction.
The stamp tax on dividend payments or credits has been repealed, and a 5% income tax should be paid on dividend payments or credits in account equity.
## Solidarity tax (*Impuesto de Solidaridad* or ISO)
The ISO tax rate of 1% is assessed on the net assets of a corporation, or on the gross income of a corporation, whichever is higher, and there is no limit on the amount to be paid. Tax paid may be credited against the corporation’s income tax. If the ISO exceeds the income tax, no reimbursement is possible.
The tax is to be paid quarterly on the basis of the corporation’s opening balance sheet for each fiscal period.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (*see below*).
## Social security contributions
Corporations contribute 12.67% of their monthly payroll and employees contribute 4.83% of their monthly salary to social security.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The tax system of Guatemala is a unitary system, whereby income of all kinds, other than capital gains, is lumped together and subject to a single tax. The components of gross income subject to tax are usually business income, interest, dividends, rent, salaries, and services. Companies are subject to income tax only on their Guatemala-source income. Dividends and other income payable abroad are taxed separately by way of withholding taxes (WHTs).
For income tax purposes, there are two main systems that taxpayers may subscribe to: the system on earnings from lucrative activities and the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities. The taxpayer chooses what system the company is registered for. Once a system is chosen, it cannot be modified until the next tax period. The request for the modification must be requested before the tax authorities at least one month prior to the new tax period.
These systems are explained below.
## System on earnings from lucrative activities
Under the system on earnings from lucrative activities, the tax is determined and paid at the end of each quarter, without prejudicing the end-of-period final tax liquidation. The tax rate is 25% on net income.
This system allows taxpayers to deduct costs and expenses incurred during the period, according to requirements established by law.
## Simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities
Under the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities, the tax is payable under flat tax withholdings (the tax is to be retained by either the customer or the recipient of services) or by direct remittances to the tax office made monthly within the first ten working days of the month following the invoice date. The tax rate is 5% on gross income that ranges from 0.01 Guatemalan quetzales (GTQ) to GTQ 30,000 and 7% on the excess.
## Local income taxes
There are no specific state or provincial government taxes on income other than the two systems previously described.

## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Guatemala, a constitutional democratic republic located in Central America, is bordered by Mexico to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the west, Belize and the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Honduras and El Salvador to the south. It is divided into 22 geographic departments, with Guatemala City as the capital. The official language of Guatemala is Spanish, and its currency is the quetzal (GTQ).
Guatemala, which won its independence in 1821, is the most populous of the Central American countries. The agricultural sector accounts for nearly 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) and half of the labour force. Key agricultural exports include coffee, sugar, and bananas. The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) that entered into force in July 2006 spurred increased investment and diversification of exports, with the largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional agricultural exports.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Taxpayers under the system on earnings from lucrative activities may deduct costs and expenses from gross income, including the following.
## Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated annually using the straight-line method. The tax authority may authorise a different method on request of the taxpayer. The annual maximum rates allowed as deductible expenses are the following:
| Asset | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Building and improvements | 5 |
| Machinery and equipment | 20 |
| Furniture and fixtures | 20 |
| Vehicles | 20 |
| Tools | 25 |
| Tree and vegetable species | 15 |
| Computer equipment | 33.33 |
| Any other depreciable asset | 10 |
## Intangible assets
Intangible assets (e.g. goodwill, trademarks, manufacturing processes, patents, software, know-how) may be deductible under the straight-line method of amortisation over a period that depends on the conditions of the acquisition or creation of the intangible asset concerned, and cannot be less than five years. Goodwill actually paid can be amortised over a period of a minimum of ten years.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible.
## Interest expense
The deduction of interest expense may not exceed the result of multiplying the interest rate by three times the average net total assets reported by the taxpayer in the corresponding annual tax return.
## Uncollectible accounts
Uncollectible accounts arising in normal business operations can be deducted individually or, alternatively, via an allowance for doubtful accounts, which shall not exceed 3% of the debit balances of accounts and notes receivable.
## Charitable contributions
Duly proven donations made to the government, the municipalities, and their agencies, as well as to duly authorised not-for-profit welfare, social service, and scientific associations and foundations, universities, political parties, and guild entities, are deductible. The maximum deductible amount for income tax purposes of each period shall not exceed 5% of the donor’s net income, up to a maximum of GTQ 500,000 per year.
## Employee pension/retirement funds
The deduction of provisions to establish or increase employee pension and retirement funds or reserves is allowed, provided the government approves the related plans.
## Severance compensation payments
Severance compensation payments are allowed as deductible expenses as well as limited allocations (not to exceed 8.33% of total annual salaries and wages) to a reserve for severance compensation. Provisions pertaining to actual liability for severance compensation per year are also allowed, provided the related plans, based on collective bargaining agreements, are approved by the employer and employees.
## Fines and penalties
Charges, penalties, and interest charged by any government institutions are not deductible.
## Taxes
All taxes are deductible, except income tax and VAT when these are not considered as a cost.
## Net operating losses
Operating losses may not be carried forward for deduction from otherwise taxable profits. Guatemalan laws also do not permit carryback of losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Deduction for royalties will be allowed, up to 5% of gross income. The deductible expenses for technical services rendered from abroad shall not exceed 5% of gross income.

# Guatemala
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
There is no consolidation for tax purposes, as each group entity is treated as an independent taxpayer that shall file its own tax returns.
## Transfer pricing
All companies that have any transaction with a related party abroad should have a transfer pricing study.
From a Guatemalan transfer pricing perspective, the scope of application of the rules of valuation of transactions between related parties reaches any operation that has been carried out between a person living in Guatemala with a resident abroad.
Local legislation allows the selection of traditional methods and profit-based methods consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines as well as a sixth method applicable to imports and exports.
Advance pricing agreements (APAs) are permitted, and it is also stated that the tax authority can reclassify activities according to its true nature in accordance with Tax Code statements.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation applies regarding deductible expenses for interest paid. The deductible amount for such costs may not exceed the value of multiplying the annual maximum simple interest rate determined by the Guatemalan Monetary Board for tax purposes by three times the amount of average total net assets submitted by the taxpayer in the annual income tax return.
Average total net assets is defined as the sum of total net assets of the previous year and total net assets at the end of the year in force (both values must correspond to the amounts filed in the annual income tax return of each period of final settlement) divided by two. Total net assets are defined by law to correspond to the book value of all goods that are actually the property of the taxpayer.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Guatemala does not have any provisions regulating CFCs.

## Foreign tax credit
Guatemala has no provisions or agreements signed to avoid international double taxation, and no foreign tax credit is allowed.
## Drawback industries (*maquila*)
The Law of Promotion and Development of Exports Activities and Drawback Industries is known in Guatemala as *maquila*. This law seeks to promote, encourage, and develop the manufacture of products within areas controlled by the Customs Authority for export to countries outside the Central American region, as well as to regulate exporting and drawback activities.
The exporter may apply for authorisation to operate under any of the following three systems provided by the law:
Tax incentives and benefits of the law include the following:

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Accurate and current information regarding taxation in Guatemala is often difficult to obtain as the country lacks reporting services such as those available in other countries. It is also difficult to determine how the tax laws will be applied in practice in complex situations. The laws and regulations are limited and ordinarily cover only the most common situations. The system of legal precedent resulting from court decisions is narrowly used, and each issue is resolved by reference to the respective codes. Guatemala has shown little interest in tax planning, but it is possible to have informal consultations with the tax authorities and to obtain authoritative rulings in many cases. Discrepancies between government and management criteria are commonly brought to judgment by the Constitutional Court, whose binding sentences generally abrogate the laws in dispute.

Compensation related to services performed outside Guatemala is not taxable.
### Payment of incentive bonus to employees
An addition to normal compensation is to be paid to all employees, as determined by an incentives plan commonly agreed on between the corporation and the labour force (this bonus must be equal or higher than GTQ 250 per month). This bonus is exempt for employee/employers social security contributions.
This additional compensation for the employee is exempt from social security contributions. It is treated as a deductible item for the employer.
## Capital gains
Guatemalan-source capital gains are taxed at a flat rate of 10%. Capital gains and investment income from outside the country are not taxed by Guatemala.
Capital losses can be netted only against capital gains.
## Dividend income
A non-resident alien's dividend income from a Guatemalan source is subject to income tax withholding at 5%.
## Interest income
Interest income earned by domiciled persons is subject to income tax withholding at 10%.
