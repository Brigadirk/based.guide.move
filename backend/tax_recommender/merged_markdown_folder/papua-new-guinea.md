## Contributions to employee superannuation funds
Papua New Guinea does not have a social security system. However, there are compulsory superannuation contributions for PNG citizen employees (superannuation contributions are not currently required for non-citizen employees but may be made on a voluntary basis). An employer of 15 or more persons must register with an authorised superannuation fund, unless operating in an exempt industry (currently certain agricultural sectors). Membership is compulsory for PNG citizens who work for more than 59 days in any three-month period and voluntary for non-citizens.
Contributions are remitted by the employer at the following rates, as a percentage of gross basic salary (excluding overtime, bonus, and commission):
Distributions from authorised superannuation funds (other than the employee's own contributions) are taxed at the employee's marginal rate unless the distribution to the employee qualifies for concessional taxation. Concessional taxation is based on years of membership of the fund, as set out in the following table:
| Years of membership of a fund | Rate of tax |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 5 | Marginal rate |
| 5 to 9 | The lesser of 15% or the marginal rate of tax |
| 9 to 15 | The lesser of 8% or the marginal rate of tax |
| More than 15 | 2% |
## Consumption taxes
### Goods and services tax (GST)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Papua New Guinea does not have a wealth tax system.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Papua New Guinea.
## Stamp duties
## Local taxes
While some provinces have a 'head tax', Papua New Guinea does not have a local tax system.

# Papua New Guinea
## Overview
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Papua New Guinea (PNG) lies on the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, located between the Coral Sea and the South Pacific Ocean among the islands of Oceania. In 1885, it was divided between Germany (north) and the United Kingdom (south). The area controlled by the United Kingdom was transferred to Australia in 1902, which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to administer the combined areas until Papua New Guinea gained its independence in 1975. Papua New Guinea's capital city is Port Moresby, and its official languages are English, Tok Pisin, and Hiri Motu. The currency in Papua New Guinea is the Papua New Guinea kina (PGK).
Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation has been hampered by rugged terrain and the high cost of developing infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the population. Mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings. A consortium led by a major American oil company commenced production of the country's estimated 227 billion cubic metres of natural gas reserves into liquefied natural gas (LNG) in April 2014 with the first shipment of LNG being delivered to Japan in May 2014, ahead of schedule. The project continues to operate and is a significant contributor to government revenues annually.
There are also a number of major resource projects in the pipeline, including the Wafi Golpu project, Frieda River Copper-Gold project, ‘Papua LNG’, Papua New Guinea’s second LNG project, and a potential expansion of the PNG LNG project. Of these projects, Papua LNG has signed gas agreements with the state and is reported to be targeting completion of front-end engineering and design (FEED) by the end of 2023.

# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Taxable income is defined as the sum of assessable income minus allowable deductions. In practice, profits are calculated for tax purposes by reference to the profits reported in the financial accounts. Accounts must be prepared in accordance with PNG accounting principles, which follow the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
## Inventory valuation
There is no form of stock relief or trading stock valuation adjustment to recognise the effects of inflation in Papua New Guinea. There is a once-only option to adopt the lowest of the cost amount, the market selling value, or the replacement value (which, in practice, may mean that book and tax valuations for trading stock are not aligned). Where the option is not exercised, the value of the stock is deemed to be the cost price; however, neither the income tax law nor the associated regulations provide detailed guidance on what constitutes 'cost price' (the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue has not produced any related guidance to date). It will generally be the case that where a taxpayer has determined a cost price in accordance with IFRS, that cost price will also be accepted for income tax purposes.
In special circumstances, the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue may accept a lower valuation.
## Capital gains
There is no general capital gains tax in Papua New Guinea. However, profits arising on the sale of property acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit, or from the carrying out of a profit-making scheme, are taxable as ordinary income.
## Dividend income
Unless otherwise exempt from CIT, dividends are included in the assessable income of a shareholder.
### Inter-company dividends
Dividends received by a resident company from other companies, whether resident or non-resident, while being assessable to tax, are generally subject to a full tax rebate and are effectively received tax-free. However, where a company has losses on other activities or losses carried over from earlier years, those losses are applied against dividend income before the calculation of the dividend rebate.
### Stock dividends
In most cases, the payment of a dividend by way of the issue of shares is subject to the same taxation treatment as the payment of a dividend by way of cash or the distribution of other property. However, dividends paid by the issue of shares wholly and exclusively out of profits arising from the sale or revaluation of assets not acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit are exempt from income tax and dividends WHT.
## Interest income
Unless exempt under specific provisions, interest paid or credited by a financial institution, the Central Bank, or a company to a person resident in Papua New Guinea is includable in income, and the person making the payment of or crediting interest in the account is liable to withhold and pay tax upon the amount.
## Royalty income
Tax is imposed on royalties and similar payments made to non-residents who do not have a PE in Papua New Guinea. The tax must be withheld by the payer on behalf of the payee and remitted to the IRC. The tax payable on royalties paid to a party who is not an ‘associated person’ is the lesser of:
Royalty payments to a non-resident ‘associated person’ are liable for a WHT of 30% of gross payments (subject to any DTT), with no option to adopt the net income basis.
The definition of ‘associated person’ is detailed and widely drawn. Broadly, it encompasses relatives, partners, companies under effective common control, and related trust interests.
There is also a 5% WHT on mining, petroleum, timber, and fishing royalties to landowners.
## Partnership income
A partner’s share of the assessable income of the partnership less all allowable deductions to the partnership is includable in the partner’s assessable income for the year of income. Likewise, the partner’s individual interest in a partnership loss incurred in the year of income is an allowable deduction. Further, if income is exempt income to the partnership, this income will be exempt income to the individual partner relative to their individual interest.
## Unrealised exchange gains/losses
Generally, foreign exchange gains realised and derived from debts made on or after 11 November 1986 or denominated in a currency other than the Papua New Guinea kina are included in assessable income.
## Foreign income
PNG resident companies are liable for CIT on their income from all sources (i.e. including foreign-sourced income). A foreign tax credit may be available to offset foreign tax paid against PNG tax payable (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](papua-new-guinea/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
There are no provisions in Papua New Guinea that permit the deferral of the taxation of income derived outside Papua New Guinea. Subject to the operation of a DTT, foreign-sourced income derived by a resident of Papua New Guinea is subject to tax in Papua New Guinea in the year in which it is derived, irrespective of whether or not that income is repatriated to Papua New Guinea.

## Dividends, interest, royalties, and technical/management fees
The following WHT rates apply to dividends, interest, royalties, and technical fees under PNG domestic law and tax treaties. PNG domestic legislation provides an exemption from WHT for dividends and interest in certain circumstances. The higher rates quoted are the maximum rates allowable under the treaties.
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest (1) | Royalties | Technical fees |
| Resident company | 0 | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| Resident individual | 15 | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| Non-resident corporations and individuals | 15 | 15 | 10/30 (2) | 17 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |  |
| Australia | 15 | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Canada | 15 | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| China | 15 | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Fiji | 15 | 10 | 15 | 15 |

| New Zealand | 15 | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Singapore | 15 | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| United Kingdom | 15 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
Notes
1. There is no WHT on interest when:
2. A royalty paid to a non-resident associate of the payee will suffer a 30% WHT. Where the non-resident is not an associate of the payee, the WHT rate will be 10% (or 48% of the taxable income derived from the royalty if the non-resident chooses to lodge an income tax return in Papua New Guinea).
3. The treaty with Germany has not yet been ratified by Germany.
## Business income WHT
Income derived by local contractors in certain industries is covered by the business income WHT regime. The industries affected include:
Businesses affected are required to have a certificate of compliance and to produce it when entering into contracts with their customers. Payers are required to file an annual income reporting statement where they make either an eligible payment of PGK 500 or more in relation to one contract or eligible payments for several contracts exceeding PGK 5,000 in the year of income in relation to a single payee. Payers are required to deduct a 10% WHT if payees do not produce a certificate of compliance.
## Non-resident insurer WHT
Premiums paid to non-resident insurers in respect of insurance contracts on property situated in Papua New Guinea or insured events that can only occur in Papua New Guinea are subject to tax in Papua New Guinea. The tax is calculated on a deemed taxable income equal to 10% of the gross premium, which is taxed at the non-resident tax rates of 48% (companies) or 30% (unincorporated associations). Tax treaties may limit the rate of tax applied.

# Papua New Guinea
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the period 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Annual income tax returns are generally due for lodgement by 30 June of the following year under most tax agent lodgement programs. Where a tax agent is not used, the return is due to be lodged by 28 February of the following year. Each individual is assessed separately. There is no joint assessment for husbands and wives.
Papua New Guinea operates on a full assessment basis, and, where required, individuals lodge an annual income tax return showing the calculation of taxable income for the year. In addition, the return must provide detailed disclosures in relation to income derived and expenses incurred during the year of income.
## Payment of tax
Salary or wages income is subject to salary or wages tax and is subject to fortnightly assessment of tax, regardless of the employer's actual pay period. The tax assessed is a final tax and is determined by reference to standard rate tables. Employer's are required to remit salary or wages tax deducted from employee salary or wage payments on a monthly basis.
Provisional tax is levied on non-salary or wages income to ensure that, as far as possible, all income is taxed in the year in which it is earned. Every taxpayer who earns in excess of PGK 100 from non-salary or wages sources has a liability to pay provisional tax. Provisional tax is normally calculated as being equal to the income tax assessed for the preceding year but can be varied to a lesser amount if an application is lodged with the IRC prior to the due date for payment. The tax is payable no earlier than 30 September of the year of income.
Where an individual is served with a notice of assessment to income tax, any tax payable is due within 30 days of the date of service of the notice.

# Papua New Guinea
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Residents of Papua New Guinea are taxed on their worldwide income. A foreign tax credit may be available to offset foreign tax paid against PNG tax payable (*see the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](papua-new-guinea/individual/foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section*).
Non-residents are generally taxed only on their PNG-sourced income. A non-resident's PNG-sourced passive income, including dividends, interest, and royalties, may be subject to WHT. The payer of the dividend, interest, or royalty must withhold the relevant amount of the tax and remit this to PNG's IRC.
## Personal income tax rates
Income derived by individuals, including salary or wages income, will generally be taxed at the following rates:
The rates for residents are as follows:
| Taxable income (PGK) | Tax thereon (PGK) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20,000 | 0 | 30 |
| 33,000 | 3,900 | 35 |
| 70,000 | 16,850 | 40 |
| 250,000 | 88,850 | 42 |
The rates for non-residents are as follows:
| Taxable income (PGK) | Tax thereon (PGK) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 22 |
| 20,000 | 4,400 | 30 |
| 33,000 | 8,300 | 35 |
| 70,000 | 21,250 | 40 |
| 250,000 | 93,250 | 42 |
## Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) taxation of individuals
The 2020 Budget included changes to introduce a new SME taxation regime. The regime, which only applies to individuals and excludes employment income and income from professional services, applies such that all tax compliance obligations for the SME (e.g. goods and services tax [GST], personal income tax [PIT]) are satisfied where tax is calculated and paid on the following basis:
Once a taxpayer elects out of the SME regime, or exceeds the threshold, they will be taxed as an individual (i.e. at marginal tax rates).
The changes are intended to encourage the development and increased compliance of SME businesses in Papua New Guinea.

# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the period 1 January to 31 December; however, application may be made for a substituted tax year-end. These will normally be granted where the substituted tax year-end coincides with the accounting year-end of an overseas holding company. A company’s tax year does not need to be the same as its accounting period.
## Tax returns
Papua New Guinea operates on a full assessment basis, and companies are required to lodge an annual CIT return showing the calculation of taxable income for the year. In addition, the return must provide detailed disclosures in relation to income derived and expenses incurred during the year of income.
A company must file a tax return by 28 February in the year following the year of income to which the return relates. However, the following automatic extensions apply where the company lodges its return through a registered tax agent:
## Payment of tax
CIT is collected under a provisional tax system. Under this system, tax is paid in respect of a company’s current year profits (i.e. payments made in the year of income are in respect of income derived in the same year as the payment is due).
Provisional tax is assessed by the IRC based on the last return lodged. In the event that no tax was payable on the previous year’s return, the Commissioner General has the right to estimate the amount of tax based on any other information available.
Provisional tax is payable in three equal instalments by 120, 210, and 300 days after commencement of an income year.
Applications may be made to reduce provisional tax assessed if the tax due for the year in question is expected to be lower than the provisional tax assessed. Where estimated provisional tax is less than 75% of the income tax ultimately assessed, additional tax may be levied. Additional tax at a rate of 20% will be assessed, based on the difference between the estimate lodged and the provisional tax originally determined, or the actual tax payable, whichever is less. The Commissioner General has the discretion to require payment of additional tax.
Mining, petroleum, and gas companies are subject to advance payments tax, a system that broadly mirrors the provisional tax system in place for non-resource companies. The main difference for resource companies is they have the option to lodge an estimate of their taxable income for the year prior to 120, 210, and 300 days from the commencement of its income year, which the IRC uses to assess each advance payments tax instalment.
Following the lodgement of the CIT return, the IRC will serve a notice of assessment on the company. The balance of tax payable for a year of income, after the application of provisional tax (or advance payments tax in the case of a resource company) and other tax credits or rebates, is due to be paid within 30 days of the date of service of the notice of assessment.
## Tax audit process
## Period for amendment of assessments
Where the IRC considers that a taxpayer made a full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for assessing their returns as originally assessed, the IRC may only amend an assessment that increases the tax liability of the taxpayer within three years from the date that tax became due and payable under the original assessment.
Where the IRC considers that a taxpayer did not make a full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for the assessment of their returns, and there has been an avoidance of tax, then:
In late 2011, the IRC issued Taxation Circular No 2011/2, which provided guidance on transfer pricing matters in Papua New Guinea. The IRC continues to consider transfer pricing as an area of focus and has recently commenced targeted reviews of taxpayers with cross border transactions.
The IRC has indicated an increased focus on the effective collection of taxes and tax compliance through the implementation of a Standard Integrated Tax Accounting System (SIGTAS). The IRC has indicated that it is likely to replace SIGTAS at some stage before 2023.
Recent audit programs have also focused on employee-related taxes, and they have conducted data matching exercises alongside the immigration department targeting foreign employees and contractors.
The IRC has commenced reviews in relation to taxpayers' related party dealings as it looks to implement a number of BEPS initiatives in the coming years.

## Contributions to employee superannuation funds
Papua New Guinea does not have a social security system. However, there are compulsory superannuation contributions for PNG citizen employees (superannuation contributions are not currently required for non-citizen employees but may be made on a voluntary basis). An employer of 15 or more persons must register with an authorised superannuation fund, unless operating in an exempt industry (currently certain agricultural sectors). Membership is compulsory for PNG citizens who work for more than 59 days in any three-month period and voluntary for non-citizens.
Contributions are remitted by the employer at the following rates, as a percentage of gross basic salary (excluding overtime, bonus, and commission):
Distributions from authorised superannuation funds (other than the employee's own contributions) are taxed at the employee's marginal rate unless the distribution to the employee qualifies for concessional taxation. Concessional taxation is based on years of membership of the fund, as set out in the following table:
| Years of membership of a fund | Rate of tax |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 5 | Marginal rate |
| 5 to 9 | The lesser of 15% or the marginal rate of tax |
| 9 to 15 | The lesser of 8% or the marginal rate of tax |
| More than 15 | 2% |
## Consumption taxes
### Goods and services tax (GST)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Papua New Guinea does not have a wealth tax system.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Papua New Guinea.
## Stamp duties
## Local taxes
While some provinces have a 'head tax', Papua New Guinea does not have a local tax system.

# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Goods and services tax (GST)
The GST rate is 10% and applies to most goods and services supplied in Papua New Guinea. Exported goods and services attract a zero rate of GST. The supply of some goods and services are exempt, including medical, educational, and financial services. Land is excluded from GST, but buildings and other improvements are subject to the tax.
An import GST deferral scheme is also available. Taxpayers wishing to participate in the import deferral scheme are required to apply for approval by the IRC and must have a good history of tax compliance in order to qualify.
Directors of companies that fail to comply with GST obligations are personally liable for a penalty equal to the outstanding tax liability that the company ought to have remitted to the IRC.
## Customs duties
The majority of manufacturing inputs (including plant and machinery) attract no customs duties, and other customs duty rates are being progressively reduced. The remaining rates for customs duties vary depending on the nature of the good being imported and are assessed on the total value of the goods imported, including cost, insurance, and freight (CIF). Customs bonds may be issued for the temporary importation of goods that are to be re-exported within 12 months.
## Excise taxes
Although customs duties are now minimal in many cases, some goods, most notably motor vehicles, now attract excise tax. Private motor vehicles can attract excise tax of up to 40%, whereas work vehicles attract excise tax of 10%. Excise taxes can also apply to some domestically produced goods, including refined fuel products, alcohol, and tobacco. The tobacco excise tax is increased 5% biannually (10% annually).
## Land tax
Land tax is imposed annually by provincial governments on the unimproved value of the land, and the power to levy land tax is vested exclusively with the provincial governments. In Papua New Guinea, land tax is difficult to implement and faces major geographical and social problems.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duty applies at varying rates on documents and certain transactions. Of particular note is duty charged on the conveyance of property, which rises to a maximum of 5% where the value of the property being transferred exceeds 100,000 PNG kina (PGK). The duty is payable by the purchaser, and a 5% duty on the unencumbered value of land may also be payable where there is a transfer of shares in certain landholding companies.
Other dutiable transactions include share transfers (including some share buy-backs), which are subject to a rate of 1%. The Collector of Stamp Duties has the power to amend assessments and refund overpayments of stamp duty.
The Stamp Duties Act was amended to implement a rental income compliance system. The amendment effectively makes it compulsory for a landlord to provide their Taxation Identification Number (TIN) on lease documents, as lease documents will not otherwise be stamped.
Stamp duty is payable on documents executed outside Papua New Guinea that relate to property or matters done or to be done in Papua New Guinea.
## Export duties
### Timber
Export duty on timber logs (not sawn timber or plantation logs) is calculated with reference to the freight on board (FOB) value per cubic metre of exported logs and rates that increase as the value of the exported logs increase.
### Spices
Levies are imposed from time to time on the export of specified spices (e.g. vanilla).
## Payroll taxes
### Salary or wages tax (SWT)
Businesses paying salary or wages to employees are required to withhold SWT (calculated at the prescribed marginal rates) and remit to the IRC on the seventh day of the month following the month of payment.
Salary or wages is defined as remuneration paid to employees in cash or kind, including benefits such as accommodation and transportation.
Normal employment-related receipts and benefits also include any remuneration paid as consultancy fees or fees for professional services, where the remuneration is paid wholly or substantially for personal services performed in Papua New Guinea.
Directors are personally liable for any unpaid SWT obligations of their companies. Directors who fail to ensure their company complies with its SWT reporting obligations may be penalised at a rate of 20% of the unpaid tax liability *per annum*. After three months of non-payment of outstanding SWT, directors will not be able to obtain a remission of penalties imposed.
## Contributions to employee superannuation funds
Contributions to employee superannuation funds are compulsory for entities with 15 or more permanent employees. The employer’s compulsory contribution is 8.4% of each employee’s gross basic salary. The employee’s minimum contribution is 6.0%.
Membership is generally compulsory for citizens. Non-citizens are currently exempt; however, this is under continuing review.
Contributions must be paid to an authorised superannuation fund. Contributions paid to an authorised fund are tax-deductible to the extent that they do not exceed 15% of the relevant employee’s gross taxable salary. Contributions to non-resident funds are not tax-deductible.
## Training levy
The training levy is abolished effective from 1 January 2018.
Previously, all businesses whose annual payroll exceeded PGK 200,000 were subject to a 2% training levy, calculated on the sum of the taxable salaries, including benefits, of all personnel. Qualifying expenses incurred in training PNG citizen employees were creditable up to the actual amount of the levy. The training levy, if payable, was not tax-deductible.
## Departure tax
A departure tax is collected by airlines issuing tickets for persons departing Papua New Guinea.
## Gaming machine tax
Papua New Guinea imposes a 74% tax on gross revenue from gaming machines.
## Resource project production levies
Production royalties of 2% are payable to the national government on the net smelter return from mining operations. These royalties are tax-deductible. A royalty, at the rate of 2% of the wellhead value, is also payable from the production of petroleum and gas operations. Holders of new petroleum development licences are entitled to treat royalties as income tax paid. However, new petroleum projects will also pay a tax-deductible development levy calculated at the same rate of 2% of the wellhead value.
Mining projects are also required to pay a production levy to the Mineral Resources Authority calculated at a rate between 0.25% and 0.5% of the assessable income from production.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
PNG resident companies are liable for income tax on their worldwide income. Companies that are not resident in Papua New Guinea are only required to remit tax on income sourced in Papua New Guinea. A non-resident’s PNG-sourced passive income, including dividends, interest, and royalties, may be subject to WHT. It is ordinarily the case that the payer of the dividend, interest, or royalty must withhold the relevant amount of the tax and remit this to PNG’s Internal Revenue Commission (IRC).
Papua New Guinea levies corporate income tax (CIT) on companies on a flat rate basis.
Generally, trading profits and other income (except income that is specifically exempt) of resident companies in Papua New Guinea are assessed tax at a rate of 30%, whereas non-resident companies operating in Papua New Guinea are assessed tax at a rate of 48%.
The most recent budget also introduced a new income tax rate to apply to commercial banks. These entities will be subject to tax at the rate of 45%.
## Overseas shippers
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local income taxes in Papua New Guinea.

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Income Tax Act rewrite
In 2020, Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) Treasury released for public consultation the much-anticipated rewrite of the Income Tax Act (the Act). The consultation draft proposed a commencement date of 1 January 2021. However, despite consultation during 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Bill has not yet been presented to Parliament. As of the middle of 2023, there has been no formal commitments from Treasury in relation to the expected date of entry into force once passed, although the Treasurer did note that, in accordance with feedback from various stakeholders, the Bill's transitional provisions and certain subsidiary legislation would be fully developed before the Bill is presented to Parliament.
This statement from the Treasurer is a reaction to the fact that despite the rewrite being advertised as an attempt to simplify tax law to enable greater participation, and ultimately greater compliance, in the tax system, a number of design features have permeated the initial and most recent drafts, including:
A number of the proposed policy shifts that may impact companies include:
## 2024 National Budget and other legislative developments
The 2024 National Budget (released in November 2023) contained very limited tax changes.
There were no changes to corporate income tax (CIT), and there was no commitment to bring forward the rewrite of the Income Tax Act.
The most significant change was to make a temporary increase in the tax-free threshold for salary and wages tax imposed on individuals (SWT) into a permanent change. There was also a repeal of the dependent tax rebate that was available for individuals to be applicable from 1 January 2024. However, during early 2024, in response to public unrest, the dependent rebate is set to be reinstated.
## MLI and MAAC ratified
At the end of August 2023, the Internal Revenue Commission announced that Papua New Guinea has ratified the Multilateral Administrative Assistance Convention (MAAC) and the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), establishing Papua New Guinea's presence within the realm of international tax collaboration. However, there have been no consequential amendments introduced to legislation.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
A company will be deemed a resident for CIT purposes if it meets either the (i) incorporation test or (ii) the management and control test.
## Incorporation test
A company incorporated in Papua New Guinea is automatically regarded as a PNG tax resident. However, the operation of the law of another country and a relevant double taxation treaty (DTT) may result in a company also being treated as resident in another country.
## Management and control test
A company is a PNG tax resident if it is managed and controlled in Papua New Guinea, regardless of where it is incorporated. Generally, a company is managed and controlled in Papua New Guinea if key decisions affecting the company are made at directors’ meetings held in Papua New Guinea. This also includes a company incorporated outside Papua New Guinea that trades in Papua New Guinea and has its voting power controlled by resident shareholders.
## Dual residence
An entity may be a tax resident of both Papua New Guinea and another country by application of domestic legislation. A DTT entered into between Papua New Guinea and another country may contain a tiebreaker test to determine the country of residence for the purposes of the DTT.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The concept of 'permanent establishment' has limited significance in the domestic taxation law of Papua New Guinea and is defined to mean a place at or through which a person carries on any business. Under domestic taxation law, Papua New Guinea will seek to tax the PNG-sourced income of a non-resident irrespective of whether or not that income is derived at or through a PE in Papua New Guinea.
Where PNG has entered into a DTT, the concept of PE becomes more important as it will then be one of the factors determining Papua New Guinea’s taxing rights over income sourced in Papua New Guinea, particularly with respect to the business profits of a non-resident company. In general terms, Papua New Guinea’s DTTs:

# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
General deduction provisions provide that all losses and expenditures, to the extent incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing that income, are allowable deductions. However, the general deduction provisions do not allow a deduction to the extent a loss or expenditure is an outgoing of capital, or of a capital, private, or domestic nature, or incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income.
## Depreciation
Depreciation is allowed for equipment and other assets at prescribed rates. A taxpayer must use the diminishing-value method unless an election is made to use the prime-cost method. The applicable diminishing-value rates are 150% of the prime-cost rates.
### Plant, machinery, and equipment
Plant, machinery, and equipment (including buildings) are depreciable at rates according to their estimated lives. A taxpayer other than a taxpayer who derives income from mining, petroleum, or gas operations may elect to claim special accelerated depreciation rates for certain capital items. For example, flexible depreciation rates (up to 100%) may be claimed on new industrial plant with a life exceeding five years that is used for manufacturing purposes. Other new plant and articles used in manufacturing, construction, transport, storage, communication, and agricultural production are eligible for an accelerated deduction equal to 20% of cost in the year of purchase. New plant and articles used for tourism are eligible for an accelerated deduction equal to 55% of cost in the year of purchase.
### Motor vehicles
Motor vehicles are generally depreciable at 20% of prime cost. There is no upper limit in value for depreciation purposes.
### Buildings
Buildings forming an integral part of plant, machinery, and equipment are depreciable at a prime-cost rate of up to 7.5%, depending on the construction materials. Buildings housing plants eligible for the one-year write-off deduction (*see comments on new industrial plant under Plant, machinery, and equipment above*) can be written off in the year of construction. Other income-producing buildings may qualify for the accelerated deduction of 20% in the year of purchase.
### Agricultural and fishing plants
Most items of new agricultural and commercial fishing plants qualify for 100% depreciation, as do boats and ships, including ancillary equipment, used solely as dive boats or for scuba diving by accredited tour operators. Other new items having a life exceeding five years used by a person carrying on agricultural operations are eligible for accelerated depreciation in the initial year of use.
## Goodwill
A deduction is not available for goodwill or the amortisation of goodwill in Papua New Guinea (this being an amount not deductible under ordinary concepts and an item for which there is no specific deduction provision).
## Start-up expenses
It will generally be the case that start-up expenses will not be deductible in Papua New Guinea. Such expenses are generally either capital, or of a capital nature, or incurred prior to the derivation of assessable income. There is no specific deduction provision for the deductibility of start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
A deduction is generally available for interest incurred on an arm’s-length basis, subject to meeting the general principles for deductibility and the requirements under the thin capitalisation rules (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*). Where interest is incurred in connection with the construction or acquisition of a plant or capital asset, that interest is not immediately deductible. Rather, such interest is deemed to form part of the cost of that asset (and in the case of a plant will then form part of the base from which future depreciation deductions may be claimed).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible if they have previously been included in assessable income and written off by year-end or if the bad debt was in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business of money lending.
## Double deductions
An additional amount equal to the actual amount of expenditure incurred is deductible in respect of certain expenditures (e.g. export market development costs, certain donations). In other words, a ‘double deduction’ is available with respect to these items.
### Donations
It is considered that donations made by a corporate taxpayer meet the general principles for deductibility and hence will generally be deductible (notwithstanding the specific provision dealing with gifts to charitable bodies has no current effect as there are no charitable bodies approved by the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue for this purpose). There are specific provisions in Papua New Guinea’s taxation law dealing with the deductibility of certain donations, some of which provide a deduction for up to 200% of the value of the amount donated.
## Pension expenses
## Taxes
A deduction is not allowable in respect of payments of income tax. Other taxes may be deductible, subject to meeting the general principles for deductibility.
## Net operating losses
### Domestic
Trading losses may be offset against all income received in the same accounting period or carried forward and offset against future trading profits. The limitation period on the carryforward of losses is generally 20 years. Losses may not be carried back against prior years’ profits. Primary production losses and resource project losses may be carried forward without a time limitation, although, again, they may not be carried back (*see the [Tax credits and incentives](tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
Note that the carryforward of losses is subject to a 50% or more continuity of shareholding and control test, or a continuity of business test where there is a breach of the ownership test.
### Foreign
Losses incurred by a resident taxpayer from a source outside Papua New Guinea (other than in relation to export market development) are not deductible against assessable income derived within Papua New Guinea. In practice, overseas losses can be carried forward and offset against overseas income for up to 20 years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The deduction available to a taxpayer for management fees paid to an associated person is limited to the greater of:
The limitation applies to both resident and non-resident taxpayers. Special rules apply to mining, petroleum, and gas companies. These limits may not apply where the recipient of the management fee is resident in a country with which Papua New Guinea has a DTT or where it can be demonstrated that the management fee arrangements do not have the purposes or effect of avoiding or altering the income tax payable in Papua New Guinea.

# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Companies are assessed for CIT separately, regardless of whether they are part of a group of associated or related companies. Losses of one company within a group cannot be offset for tax purposes against the profits of another company within that group.
The Companies Act allows two or more companies to amalgamate and continue as one, and provisions are in place to allow this to occur without any adverse CIT consequences.
## Transfer pricing
Papua New Guinea has transfer pricing provisions that require transactions with foreign affiliates to be conducted on an arm's-length basis. Disclosure of such transactions is done through an international dealings schedule (IDS). Corporate taxpayers (including companies, superannuation funds, and unit trusts) that have transactions or dealings with international affiliates that exceed PGK 100,000 in an income year or have aggregate loan balances with international affiliates in excess of PGK 2 million at any time during an income year are required to prepare and lodge an IDS with their income tax return for that year of income.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules apply to prevent taxpayers from incurring excessive levels of debt. By excessively gearing their investments, companies are able to claim greater tax deductions through the interest expense charged on such debt. Thin capitalisation rules typically feature a debt-to-equity ratio that governs the ratio by which companies can borrow from related parties relative to their equity. Any interest charged on debt that exceeds this ratio will not be deductible for CIT purposes.
Papua New Guinea's thin capitalisation rules apply a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1 for all PNG companies. Note that the 2020 Budget amended the ratio of resources companies from 3:1 to 2:1 effective immediately. We understand that the intention of parliament was that this reduction would apply from 1 January 2021; however, legislative amendments will be required in 2020 to give effect to this intent.
These rules do not apply to licensed financial institutions and do not apply to interest paid under domestic debt for non-resource companies. If the ratio is breached, a proportion of the interest on foreign debt will be denied as a tax deduction. For resource companies, a proportion of interest on all debt will be denied.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Papua New Guinea does not have CFC rules.

# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
In this section, we comment on the more significant tax credits and incentives available in Papua New Guinea, followed by a summary of those with more limited application.
## Foreign tax credit
A foreign tax credit may be available to offset foreign tax paid against PNG tax payable. The foreign tax credit is limited to either the foreign tax paid or the average PNG tax payable on that foreign income, whichever is less. There is no mechanism to carry forward excess foreign tax credits for utilisation in a subsequent year.
## Primary production incentives
Key incentives that are available with specific application to primary production activities include:
## Agricultural production extension services deduction
A 150% deduction is available for expenditure on services provided free of charge to smallholder growers, including the provision of advice, training, and technical assistance in relation to primary production to assist growers with production, processing, packaging, and marketing issues.
## Double deduction for export market development costs
Expenditure incurred in the promotion for sale outside Papua New Guinea of goods manufactured in Papua New Guinea or tourism promotion is eligible for double deduction. The total tax saving cannot exceed 75% of the expenditure incurred.
## Export incentives
Prior to 1 January 2015, the net export income from the export sale of certain types of goods was exempt for the first four years of income, with a partial exemption in the following three years. This exemption is not applicable from 1 January 2015 (except in respect of goods that qualified for the exemption prior to that date).
## Tax credit for infrastructure development by agricultural, mining, petroleum, and gas companies
A tax credit is available to agricultural, mining, petroleum, gas, and certain tourism companies that incur expenditure on a prescribed infrastructure development. The credit is limited to 2% of the assessable income or the amount of tax payable for the year (in respect of that mining, petroleum, or gas project), whichever is less. Excess expenditure over the 2% or tax payable may be included in the following year’s rebate claim. Unutilised credits or excess expenditure can generally be carried forward for up to seven years from the year it was incurred.
A prescribed infrastructure development includes a school, aid post, hospital road, and other capital assets that have been approved as such by the Department of National Planning and the IRC. It cannot be an expenditure required under the Mining Act or the Oil and Gas Act.
## Other tax incentives in Papua New Guinea
Other tax incentives available in Papua New Guinea include:
## Incentives for petroleum, mining, and gas operations
Special incentives and rules apply to mining, petroleum, and gas exploration, extraction, and production activities. The main aspects are as follows:
### Project basis of assessment
A project basis of assessment (ring-fencing) is adopted for all resource projects. This means losses from other operations, regardless of whether or not they are resource related, cannot generally be offset against resource project income from a particular ring-fenced project. However, there are some concessions to the ring-fencing principle in respect of exploration expenditure and expenditure in respect of discontinued projects and losses arising from site restoration costs.
In general, all costs incurred in the exploration and development phases of the project are accumulated and amortised over the life of the project. Once production starts, an immediate deduction is allowed for 'normal' operating and administration expenses. Capital expenditure incurred after the start of production are capitalised and amortised over the life of the project.
### Rate of tax
A standardised rate of 30% applies to all companies resident in Papua New Guinea.
### Interest deductions
Interest is not deductible prior to the commencement of a resource project. Following the issue of a resource development licence, a person carrying on a resource project or exploration in relation to a resource project may claim a deduction against resource income for interest on money borrowed for carrying on the relevant operations or exploration. This is subject to a number of conditions, including the resource company maintaining a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1 (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
### Capital allowances
Allowable exploration expenditures (AEE) are amortised over the life of the resource project. The deduction is calculated by dividing the unamortised balance by either the remaining life of the project or four, whichever is less. The amount of the deduction is limited to the amount of income remaining after deducting all other deductions, other than deductions for allowable capital expenditure. In other words, the deduction cannot create a tax loss.
Allowable capital expenditures (ACE) are amortised over the life of the resource project. The ACE is split into two categories: capital expenditures with an estimated effective life of more than ten years (long-life ACE) and capital expenditures with an estimated effective life of less than ten years (short-life ACE).
The annual deduction for long-life ACE is claimed on a straight-line basis over ten years.
Where the remaining life of the project is less than ten years, the rate at which the deduction is allowed is calculated by referring to the remaining life of the project. For short-life ACE, the annual deduction is calculated by dividing the unamortised balance by either the remaining life of the project or four, whichever is less. For new mining projects, the deductions for both long-life ACE and short-life ACE are calculated by dividing the unamortised balance by either the remaining life of the project or four, whichever is less.
The amount of the deduction for ACE is limited to the amount of income remaining after deducting all other deductions. In other words, the deduction cannot create a tax loss.
### Off-licence exploration expenditure
A major easing of the ring-fencing principle applies to taxpayers that are involved in a producing project where the taxpayer or a related party incurs exploration expenditure outside the area of the productive project. In this situation, the taxpayer can elect (whether or not it is currently involved in a producing project) to add such exploration expenditure to an exploration pool that can be amortised against income from the producing project.
The amount allowable as a deduction from this exploration pool in respect of resource operations carried on by the taxpayer or a related corporation is the lesser of:
### Management fees
Once a resource project derives assessable income, the deduction for management fees is restricted to 2% of operating expenses other than management fees. During the exploration phase of a project, the amount of management fees that can be treated as allowable exploration expenditure is limited to 2% of the exploration expenditure other than management fees. Furthermore, during the development phase, the amount of management fees that can be treated as allowable capital expenditure is limited to 2% of the allowable capital expenditure other than management fees.
### Transfer of expenditure
When interests are transferred from one taxpayer to another, the vendor and purchaser can agree to transfer deduction entitlements for the unamortised balances of allowable exploration expenditure and allowable capital expenditure to the purchaser.
### Liquefied natural gas (LNG) project
A number of provisions with specific application to the PNG LNG project have been included in the Income Tax Act, Stamp Duties Act, Goods and Services Tax Act, Customs Act, and Excise Act.
### Additional profits tax
A modified additional profits tax applies to all resource projects (mining, petroleum, and gas). The additional profits tax applies a tax rate of 30% to returns in excess of a 15% hurdle rate.

## Income Tax Act rewrite
In 2020, Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) Treasury released for public consultation the much-anticipated rewrite of the Income Tax Act (the Act). The consultation draft proposed a commencement date of 1 January 2021. However, despite consultation during 2021 and 2022, the Bill was not presented to Parliament for the budget session in 2021 and was again not presented in November 2022. As of the end of 2022, there has been no formal commitments from Treasury in relation to further consultation or the expected date of entry into force once passed, although the Treasurer did note that, in accordance with feedback from various stakeholders, the Bill's transitional provisions and certain subsidiary legislation would be fully developed before the Bill is presented to Parliament.
This statement from the Treasurer is a reaction to the fact that despite the rewrite being advertised as an attempt to simplify tax law to enable greater participation, and ultimately greater compliance, in the tax system, a number of design features have permeated the initial and most recent drafts, including:
A number of the proposed policy shifts that may impact companies include:
## 2024 legislative developments
The National Budget for 2024 introduced legislation to make a temporary increase in the tax-free threshold for salary and wages tax imposed on individuals (SWT) into a permanent change. The annual tax-free threshold is now 20,000 PNG kina (PGK).
There was also a repeal of the dependent tax rebate that was available for individuals to be applicable from 1 January 2024. However, during early 2024, in response to public unrest, the dependent rebate is set to be reinstated. The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) will administer the dependent rebate as remaining in existence from 1 January 2024.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Employment expenses
Salary or wage earners receive a 25% rebate for allowable deductions to the extent of any salary or wages tax paid during an income year.
## Business deductions
In PNG taxation law, there are general deductions and specific deductions.
Under the general deduction provision, all losses and expenditures, to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing that income, are allowable deductions. This is except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private, or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income.
Specific deductions include:
## Personal deductions
Expenditures of a private nature, such as dental or medical costs, are neither deductible nor subject to rebate or credit.
## Personal allowances
In Papua New Guinea, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (s*ee Dependant rebates in the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
## Losses
Tax losses incurred in an income year may be carried forward for utilisation in future income years for a maximum of seven years. Losses derived in earning foreign income are quarantined and are therefore not allowable as deductions against PNG-sourced income.
Capital losses are not deductible.

## Treatment of flow-thru business entities
In Papua New Guinea, individuals may conduct their business through various different structures, including as a sole trader, a partnership, or a trust.
A partnership is required to submit a return of income to the IRC. The net income disclosed in the partnership return is then shared amongst the individual partners for inclusion in their income tax returns. Similarly, losses are also able to be shared amongst partners to offset their individual income.
Trusts that operate a business in Papua New Guinea will be deemed to be resident in Papua New Guinea unless certain criteria are satisfied. The trustee is generally taxed at 30% of the net income of the trust; and unless the trust is a unit trust that meets certain criteria, the income is also taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries who are presently entitled to a share of the net income.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Employment income
Salary or wages are widely defined to include, in addition to normal employment-related receipts and benefits, any remuneration paid as consultancy fees or fees for professional services, where the remuneration is paid wholly or substantially for personal services performed in Papua New Guinea.
### Payments to employees taxed at 2%
The following payments to employees qualify to be taxed at the rate of 2%:
### Concessional taxation of redundancy payments
Concessional taxation treatment will apply to redundancy payments made after 1 January 2012 under an approved redundancy scheme. The Commissioner General shall approve a redundancy scheme if satisfied that at least 30 employees are to be genuinely made redundant under that scheme or employees are genuinely made redundant from the public sector. The rate of tax applicable to a redundancy payment is 15% up to a cap determined by reference to years of services. Amounts in excess of the cap will be subject to tax at marginal rates.
### Employee benefits
Certain benefits provided to employees are taxed at the prescribed values listed below. The value of benefits not listed below is generally a cost to the employer.
| Benefit | Taxable value per fortnight |
| --- | --- |
| Accommodation owned or rented by employer | PGK 0 to PGK 2,500 per fortnight, depending on area, market value, or market rental per week. |
| Housing allowance | The employee will be taxed on the excess of housing allowance over eligible housing expenditures and on the prescribed value of the housing. A PNG citizen who receives an allowance under an approved Low Cost Housing Scheme is not subject to tax on the allowance. |
| Motor vehicle: |  |
| Without fuel | PGK 95 per fortnight. |
| With fuel | PGK 125 per fortnight. |
| Education expenses (except tertiary education) | PGK 0 (a rebate may be available) |
| Leave fares | One annual fare for the employee and family to the place of recruitment or origin is exempt from tax. Alternatively, recreational fares and accommodation for travel within Papua New Guinea equal to the value of the benefit of one annual leave fare are exempt from tax. Additional leave fares are fully taxable; however, additional leave fares within Papua New Guinea for a person employed solely in, or in connection with, most resource projects are exempt. Additional leave fares for employees serving in hardship or remote areas may be exempted from tax at the discretion of the IRC. |
| Meals: |  |
| Messing | PGK 30 per fortnight. |
| Other | Subject to tax at the employee’s marginal rate on the amount equal to the employer’s cost or may be treated as non-deductible entertainment by the employer. |
| Public utilities, gas, domestic services, security, club subscriptions | If paid by the employer on behalf of the employee, not taxable to the employee; however, the employer is denied a deduction for the payment. If paid in the form of an allowance, fully taxable in the hands of the employee. |
| Telephone | Fully taxable to the employee at the employee’s marginal rate of tax. However, the employee can claim a rebate for work-related telephone costs. |
| Entertainment | If business entertainment expenditure is reimbursed to the employee by the employer, the reimbursement of the actual expenditure is not taxable to the employee. However, the employer is denied a deduction for the entertaining expenses. If paid in the form of an allowance, fully taxable in the hands of the employee. |
| Cash allowances | All allowances paid by the employer are to be fully taxed at the employee’s marginal rate of tax. |
## Equity compensation
There are no specific rules around stock options in Papua New Guinea. As such, gains and losses derived or incurred on these instruments are determined based on ordinary concepts and common law principles.
Where stock options have been provided in the course of employment, the value of the benefit provided is likely to be subject to salary or wages tax as employment income.
As noted below, there is no capital gains tax in Papua New Guinea. Where a gain made on stock options is considered to be capital in nature, the gain will not be taxable. It follows that any capital loss incurred is not deductible.
## Capital gains
There is no general capital gains tax in Papua New Guinea. However, profits arising on the sale of property acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit, or from the carrying out of a profit-making scheme, are fully taxable as ordinary income.
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to a dividend WHT at the rate of 15%.
## Interest income
Interest WHT of 15% must be deducted from any interest paid by a financial institution, the Central Bank, or a company to a person resident in Papua New Guinea. The WHT deducted is creditable against tax ultimately payable by a resident recipient on that income.
## Rental income
There are no special rules around rental income. Such income will be assessed as ordinary income and is required to be disclosed in the annual income tax return.

Tax credits are also known as rebates in Papua New Guinea.
## Dependant rebates
The allowable dependant rebates for salary or wage earners are built into the tax rate schedule. Non-salary or wage earners who are resident in Papua New Guinea receive the following rebates for dependants:
The maximum rebate available to an individual is PGK 1,050 *per annum* (i.e. no rebates are available for more than three dependants).
A dependant is a person whose separate net income does not exceed PGK 1,040 in the year and who is either:
Although legislation was introduced in the National Budget 2024 to repeal the rebate, in response to public unrest in January 2024, the government have announced that the rebate will continue. The IRC have confirmed that the law for employers will be administered on the basis that the rebate continued to be available from 1 January 2024.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
A person becomes a resident of Papua New Guinea during a year of income in which one commences to reside in Papua New Guinea. The definition extends to a person whose domicile is in Papua New Guinea, unless their permanent place of abode is outside Papua New Guinea, and to a person who is present in Papua New Guinea for a period of more than one-half of the year of income. This is unless the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue is satisfied that the person's usual place of abode is outside Papua New Guinea or that person does not intend to take up residence in Papua New Guinea.
