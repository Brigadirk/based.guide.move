## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Taxable period
Lebanon’s fiscal year runs from January to December and is based on the Gregorian calendar. With the special approval of the local tax authorities, companies may, however, use their own accounting year.
## Tax returns
Taxes on business income in any given year are based on the profits of the previous financial year.
Tax returns by artificial persons (entities) must be filed by 31 March of the year following the year of income. Tax returns by capital companies must be filed by 31 May of the year following the year of income.
Submission deadlines of annual declarations for institutions that are exempt from income tax (other than companies) are as follows:
If taxpayers fail to submit a tax return, realisation penalties will be due.
Realisation, including the minimum amount of fine, and late payment penalties rates were amended as per Articles 74 and 77 of the 2024 Budget Law.
## Payment of tax
The same deadlines for tax returns apply for tax payments.
If taxpayers fail to make payment, late payment penalties will be due.
## Tax audit process
The most common ways for the tax authorities to select companies for tax audits are the size of the company, the type of business, and certain risk assessment measures.
Tax audits typically cover a single type of tax.
In a typical situation, a tax audit is likely to take less than one year from first information request to substantive resolution.
## Statute of limitations
The tax administration has four years to collect its rights. The period is calculated from the end of the year that follows the current business year.
The taxable person may request the refund of excess tax within four years starting from the end of the year where the refund right was created.
The tax administration can exceed the statute of limitations in cases where a profit or revenue has been proven by a court order, arbitration, or inheritance clearance. The extension is limited till the end of the calendar year following the end of the year in which the tax administration was notified of such event.
Under the statute of limitations, a company should keep its accounting books and documentation for ten years.
## Declaration of ultimate beneficial ownership
As per the Lebanese MoF, the M18 form declaration of the ultimate beneficial owners of any Lebanese entity should be declared, pursuant to the Decision No.1472/1, dated 27 September 2018, where the deadline is 31 May of each year. For the M18 form of 2019, the deadline is extended to 31 December 2020.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are the following:
Salaries of foreign staff are normally subject to all contributions, except those for the end-of-service indemnity fund. However, foreign employees do not receive the family allowance benefits nor do they benefit from the medical reimbursements.
On February 1, 2024, the NSSF issued Memorandum no. 740 whereby it set the exchange rate to be used for the conversion of the salaries paid in foreign currencies to the highest official exchange rate published by the Central Bank (currently LL 89,500/USD 1).
In addition, starting March 2024, the Council of Ministers enacted Decree no. 12962 which increased the monthly ceiling amounts for sickness and maternity social security contributions to be 5 times the minimum monthly wage.
## Consumption taxes
### **Value-added tax (VAT)**
Mandatory registration applies to importers and exporters regardless of their turnover, while voluntary registration applies to the taxable persons who achieve a turnover exceeding LL 100 million over a period of one to 4 consecutive quarters.
Those wishing to benefit from special cases of recovery of tax with regards to exempt transactions  shall apply a classification request to the Directorate of Value Added Tax to obtain a registration number and open a tax account allowing the submission of the refund requests.
Classified taxpayers are entitled to submit the refund request starting from the tax period during which they were classified until 31 December, once a year within a period of 20 days from the end of the calendar year, provided that the total refunded VAT amount is not less than LL 50 million (as per the 2022 Budget Law). Any additional amount will be carried forward to next year. The amount less than LL 5 million is carried forward to the following year.
The standard VAT rate in Lebanon is 11%. Unless specifically exempt, VAT is levied on all commercial transactions undertaken by business entities. Export of goods and services and export-related services, international transport, and some of the intermediate operations are zero-rated. Banking, financial services, and insurance operations are exempt from VAT.
The activities performed by nurseries from VAT are now exempt from VAT as per Article 56 of Budget Law 2019.
Sales of yachts, other boats, and pleasure craft with a length of more than 15 metres belonging to non-Lebanese also benefit now from the VAT exemption as per Article 65 of Budget Law 2019. The article also included diesel oil as goods exempt from VAT.
According to the 2022 budget law, fuel, industrial equipment, raw materials used in manufacturing and agriculture are exempt from VAT until 31 December 2024. Solar power equipment used to generate electricity are also exempt from VAT from 15 November 2022 until 31 December 2023 .
Any person who independently provides taxable or zero-rated supplies in the course of an economic activity and has a turnover that exceeds LL 150 million over four successive quarters becomes liable for VAT registration.
On 27 April 2023, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) published Decree no. 11230 in the Official Gazette, whereby Article 18 of the VAT Law no. 7308, which states that VAT should be calculated following the official exchange rate, was replaced to mention that in instances where the price of the service or good is denominated in foreign currency, and until a unified exchange rate is set, the counter value of the foreign currency to be used for VAT calculation purposes should be Sayrafa rate.
Subsequently, on 15 February 2024, the 2024 Budget Law was published in the Official Gazette which introduced the following amendments.
1. Any taxable person who achieves a total turnover  in excess of  LL 5 billion over a period of one to four consecutive quarters must register for VAT.
2. Taxable persons whose total turnover was between LL 100 million and LL 5 billion during any of  the years 2020 to 2023, are no longer required to register for VAT, and may submit a request to deregister in case they have already registered for VAT.
3. Persons whose turnover didn’t reach the threshold for voluntary registration and who engaged in contracts with governmental institutions involving transactions subject to VAT or exempt with the right to deduct VAT, can apply for registration with the VAT department if their total turnover exceeds LL 5 billion over one to four consecutive quarters.
4. Importers and exporters should register for VAT irrespective of their turnover.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Lebanon.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate and gift tax rates vary from 3% to 45%, depending on the amount received and the affinity to the deceased or donor after deducting special exemptions applicable to estate beneficiaries. These tax rates apply cumulatively to all gifts and inheritances made by a specific donor to a specific recipient.
Aids, grants and subsidies received from public funds as well as donations up to LL 14.4 million are exempt from all duties, unless the donee is a non-profit organisation, a sports association, educational, artistic or religious organisation, then the exemption should not exceed LL 900 million as per Article 57 of Budget Law 2022.
Inheritance tax rates and exemptions are amended as per Article 56 and 59 of Budget Law 2022.
Inheritance tax rates were further amended as per Article 50 of the 2024 Budget Law.
## Built property tax (BPT)
The BPT is an annual progressive tax, ranging between 4% and 14%, on built property.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the net income brackets subject to built property tax effective starting the year 2022. The brackets were further amended as per the 2024 Budget Law.
## Registration taxes
When transferring ownership of real estate, registration fees of approximately 6% are applicable. As of 26 October 2017, a 2% fee is considered part of the registration fee and should be paid within 15 days from the date the contract was concluded. The real estate should be registered during one year; otherwise, the 2% paid will no longer be recoverable.
## Stamp duty
Two kinds of stamp duties are levied. A proportionate stamp duty of 0.4% is levied on all deeds and contracts (written or implied) that mention specific payments or other sums of money. A fixed stamp duty ranging between a minimum of LL 1,000 and a maximum of LL 2 million is applicable on documents in accordance with schedules appended to the stamp duty law.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that the fixed stamp duty due on invoices, receipts and debit and credit notes should be settled through monthly declarations within 15 days after the end of the month starting 1 January 2023.
The Ministry of Finance issued Decision no. 684 on 23 November 2023 to clarify that the Sayrafa rate is the exchange rate that should be used to convert the value of contracts and deeds (and any other similar documentation) denominated in foreign currency into the local currency (LL) for the purpose of calculating the respective stamp duty.
The 2024 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that; provided the stamp duty fee does not exceed LL 3 billion, the duty can be processed by marking machines operated by authorised individuals.
In addition, the 2024 Budget Law increased the fixed amount of stamp duty LL 100,000 on contracts that do not contain a specific amount and LL 20,000 on unpaid invoices.

# Lebanon
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Lebanon is 11%. Unless specifically exempt, VAT is levied on all commercial transactions undertaken by business entities. Export of goods and services and export-related services, international transport, and some of the intermediate operations are zero-rated. Banking, financial services, and insurance operations are exempt from VAT. As per the 2022 Budget Law, solar power equipment used to generate electricity are exempt from VAT from the date this Law is published (November 2022) until 31 December 2023.
Note that the recharge of expenses from an entity in Lebanon to another entity abroad is subject to VAT at 11%.
The threshold for mandatory registration is a turnover that exceeds LL 100 million in four consecutive quarters.
The 2024 Budget Law, increased the threshold for mandatory registration from LL100 million to LL5 billion over a period of one to four consecutive quarters. The new threshold is applicable starting the year 2024.
On 27 April 2023, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) published Decree no. 11230 in the Official Gazette, whereby Article 18 of the VAT Law no. 7308, which states that VAT should be calculated following the official exchange rate, was replaced to mention that in instances where the price of the service or good is denominated in foreign currency, and until a unified exchange rate is set, the counter value of the foreign currency to be used for VAT calculation purposes should be Sayrafa rate.
## Customs duties
Modern, simple, and efficient assessment means are adopted by the customs authorities (e.g. electronic declarations, declaration in advance, applying international procedures in clearing the goods, selective inspection, auditing the goods after their release, and adopting the unique declaration).
Customs rates are imposed and modified according to decisions from the Lebanese customs authorities. These decisions are adopted based on the need of the Lebanese markets of some goods and the will to protect national production sectors.
Safeguard measures are provided for in relation to imported goods. The purpose behind such measures is to protect the domestic production sectors when an increase of imports is witnessed when compared to the same period during the previous year.
The rates are determined based on a specific schedule created in conformity with the Harmonised System of Nomenclature. This conformity with the unified system allows Lebanon to represent an ‘importer friendly’ environment for importers.
The normal rates are applied where there is no preferential agreement. When the origin of the good or part of the good is from a country with which Lebanon has a preferential customs treatment, preferential rates apply.
Customs rates in Lebanon are either determined in percentage or paid as a lump sum per unit of imported products.
Based on Article 59 of Budget Law 2019, 3% in additional custom fees is enforced for three years on imported goods that are subject to VAT, except for fuel, industrial equipment, and raw materials used in manufacturing and agriculture. The 2022 Budget Law imposed an additional customs fee of 3%, to be applicable for an additional year (i.e. until 31 December 2023) which was extended until 31 December 2024 as per the 2024 Budget Law. An exemption of customs and 3% additional duty is applied for solar power equipment used to generate electricity from 15 November 2022 until 31 December 2023.
In addition, a customs fee of 10% is imposed on imported goods with similar substitutes manufactured in Lebanon in sufficient quantities and on imported luxury items. This fee is applicable for a period of 5 years.
Excise taxes
Excise taxes are mainly applicable in Lebanon on certain beverages and spirits, tobacco products, gasoline, and vehicles.
## Built property tax (BPT)
The BPT is an annual progressive tax, ranging between 4% and 14%, on built property.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the net income brackets subject to built property tax starting the year 2022.
The 2024 Budget Law further amended the net income brackets subject to built property tax starting the year 2024 to range from LL 1.2 billion to LL 6 billion.
## Stamp duty
Two kinds of stamp duties are levied. A proportionate stamp duty of 0.4% is levied on all deeds and contracts (written or implied) that mention specific payments or other sums of money.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that the fixed stamp duty due on invoices, receipts and debit and credit notes should be settled through monthly declarations within 15 days after the end of the month starting 1 January 2023.
The Ministry of Finance issued Decision no. 684 on 23 November 2022 to clarify that the Sayrafa rate is the exchange rate that should be used to convert the value of contracts and deeds (and any other similar documentation) denominated in foreign currency into the local currency (LL) for the purpose of calculating the respective stamp duty.
The 2024 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that; provided the stamp duty fee does not exceed LL 3 billion, the duty can be processed by marking machines operated by authorised individuals.
In addition, the 2024 Budget Law increased the fixed amount of stamp duty to LL100,000 on contracts that do not contain a specific amount and LL20,000 on unpaid invoices.
## Capital gains tax
Under local legislation, companies are permitted to revalue their fixed assets every five years. Capital gains recognised from such a revaluation, as well as any profits that may be realised from the disposal of fixed assets, are subject to a capital gains tax of 15%.
The MoF issued Law no. 330 on 5 December 2024 which amended article 45 of the Income Tax Law allowing taxpayers subject to the lumpsum method to revalue their fixed assets every year (instead of every 5 years) starting from the end of the year 2023 till 31 December 2026, based on the principles applicable to taxpayers subject to the real profit.
In addition, Law no. 330 mentioned that individuals and taxpayers who are not subject to income tax, or who benefit from special or permanent income tax exemptions, or those subject to income tax and owning real estate properties not used for generating operating income (e.g., real estate companies), are subject to a reduced tax rate of 1% instead of 15% on the disposal of non-residential real estates until 31 December 2026.
Income from disposal of fixed assets realised by a company is subject to 15% capital gains tax. In case of sale of shares and parts in Lebanese and foreign companies, any capital gains realised by a Lebanese corporate entity (other than holding, offshore or a company whose activity is to trade in financial investments) is subject to tax at 15% if those financial assets are classified as non-current assets on the company’s balance sheet.
Income from disposal of shares realised by a resident company whose main activity is the acquisition of investments is subject to 17% CIT.
Income from disposal of shares realised by a non-resident company is subject to 10% movable capital tax when the shares are not classified as financial non-current assets on the company’s balance sheet.
## Registration taxes
The estimated cost of establishing a company in Lebanon is around 7,500 United States dollars (USD). This includes lawyer’s fees and registration fees. The registration fees will increase if the company is established with capital exceeding the minimum requirement. However, the registration fees should not normally exceed 1% of the value of capital.
For branch offices and representative offices, establishment costs are lower and may be estimated at USD 5,000.
When transferring ownership of real estate, registration fees of approximately 6% are applicable.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are responsible for withholding and declaring payroll taxes on behalf of their employees.
On September 5 2024 the MoF issued Decision no. 959 determining the mechanism for the calculation and payment of the payroll tax for salaries paid in part or full in foreign currencies as follows:
1. For the period from January 1 to March 31, 2024, salaries paid in fresh USD are calculated using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 15,000 LL. However, if salaries are paid by cheque or via an internal bank transfer (i.e., not in fresh USD), the first 3,000 USD is calculated at the exchange rate of 1 USD = 8,000 LBP, and any amount exceeding 3,000 USD is calculated at the exchange rate of 1 USD = 1,507.5 LBP.
2. For the period starting April 1, 2024, salaries are calculated using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 89,500 LBP, regardless of the payment method.
The aforementioned Law has also amended the brackets of employment income subject to payroll progressive tax rates for 2024 and 2025. Payroll tax is levied at progressive rates of 2% to 25%  on annual payroll tax brackets between LL 317,250,000 and LL 11,896,875,000 for 2024 and between LL 360 million and LL 13.5 billion for 2025. The annual family exemptions were also amended as follows:
1. For the period from January 1, 2024, to February 15, 2024 (inclusive), family exemptions will be calculated according to the rates specified in the 2022 Budget Law, i.e., LL 4,687,500 for a single individual.
2. From February 16, 2024, onwards, the exemptions will be calculated based on the rates outlined in the 2024 Budget Law, i.e., LL 393,750,000 for a single individual.
3. Starting January 1, 2025, the family exemption for each single individual will be 450,000,000 LL to add 225,000,000 LL for married individuals with an unemployed spouse. In addition to 45,000,000 LL for each legitimate child.
Additionally, the Ministry of Finance issued Decree no.11226 which increased the minimum wage to LL 9,000,000 for monthly basic salary for employees subject to the Labor Law. This increase is applicable starting 26 April 2023.
Later on, the MoF issued Decree no. 13164 which increased the minimum wage of the employees subject to the Labor Law to LL 18,000,000, effective 1 April 2024.
Moreover, Decree no. 1311 exempts termination/severance payments from payroll tax for payments made to employees between February 15, 2024, and December 31, 2025.
Social security contributions
For the purpose of calculating social security contributions, sickness and maternity ceiling amount is set as follows:
In addition, memorandum no. 734, dated 29 December 2023, has set the monthly ceiling amounts for family allowance social security contributions LL 12,000,000 per month, starting 1 January 2024.
Accordingly, social security contributions are calculated as follows:
On the 30th of November 2023, the Ministry of Labor (“MoL”) issued Decree no. 12599 published in the Official Gazette whereby it increased the family allowances given by the  Social Security Department to be as follows:
The Decree is applicable starting from December 2023.
Moreover, on February 1, 2024, the NSSF issued Memorandum no. 740 whereby it set the exchange rate to be used for the conversion of the salaries paid in foreign currencies to the highest official exchange rate published by the Central Bank (currently LL 89,500/USD 1).
Furthermore, based on the provisions of Article 92 of the 2024 Budget Law, the tax authorities are required to provide a copy of the payroll tax declarations to the Social Security department for reconciliation purposes and to notify them of any discrepancies.
In the event of differences, any discrepancy uncovered during the reconciliation between the amounts declared to the tax authorities and those reported to the Social Security Fund will incur a penalty of ten times the amount of the difference.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
According to the principle of territoriality, taxes on salaries are due in Lebanon if one of the following conditions is met:
## Personal income tax rates
Personal income tax (PIT) is levied on wages and salaries at progressive rates. Based on the 2022 Budget Law, the brackets for the progressive payroll tax rates are between 2% and 25%, on annual payroll tax brackets between LL 18 million and LL 675 million instead of annual payroll tax brackets between LL 6 million and LL 225 million effective 1 January 2022.
These rates are reduced to half for retirement pensions and similar benefits.
Moreover, as per the 2022 Budget Law, the annual progressive brackets for income tax profits is increased to become between LL 27 million and LL 675 million applicable starting 1 January 2022.
Furthermore, as per the 2024 Budget Law, the annual progressive brackets for income tax profits is increased to become between LL 540 million and LL 13.5 billion.
## Tax on capital gains and investment income
A new Law no. 64, dated 26 October 2017, introduced new tax measures related to the capital gains on disposal of real estate (not other types of fixed assets) that is taxed at 15% instead of 10% (not applicable for individuals on up to two principal residences and if owned more than 12 years).
The 2022 Budget Law imposed a transfer tax, 3% for resident individuals and 5% for non-resident individuals, on capital gains realised by individuals on the disposal of shares in companies in case the disposed shares are shares of one of the following joint stock companies:
The gain from the disposal is the difference between the cost of acquiring the share and the actual disposal price.
The individual shareholder benefits from a 50% discount on the tax due if the transfer of shares is between the shareholders themselves or within the parents/children. Individual shareholders benefit from a full exemption of the tax due when they dispose of their shares in the remaining joint stock companies.
Moreover, Decision no. 323 issued 15 May 2023, addressed the tax treatment of income from disposal of shares realised by an individual as follows:
## Tax on interest
The tax applied on interest and revenues from saving accounts, bank deposits, credit accounts, fiduciary accounts, debt securities, and certificates of deposits has increased as per Law no. 144 of Budget Law 2019.
The tax on interest revenue is set at 7% since the issuance of Law no. 64, dated 26 October 2017.
## Tax on piecemeal compensation
Lump-sum wages paid to labourers and wage earners in an *ad hoc* manner to undertake temporary work on a piecemeal or quantity basis are taxed at 3%, regardless of their magnitude and without any deductions.
## Non-resident tax
Revenues earned by non-residents in Lebanon are subject to an effective tax rate of 2.25% of the revenue in the case of revenue from sale of materials and equipment and 7.5% of the revenue in the case of sale of services. The non-resident tax is a WHT.
As per the 2022 Budget Law nonresident tax will be due on a quarterly basis within 15 days from the end of each quarter instead of the annual submission done along with the  income tax filing.
Moreover, as per the 2024 Budget Law, non-resident tax should be settled in the same currency as the payment made to the non-resident party. In addition, the Law amended the withholding tax rates to be 3.4% on goods and 8.5% on services. This amendment becomes effective starting Q2-FY24.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Under the income tax law in Lebanon, tax is levied based on income type. Accordingly, the income tax law divides income into the following three categories:
The income tax law does not provide for a single tax on income. Accordingly, where a taxpayer has income from different sources, each type of income is taxed according to the tax chapter it falls under. The applicable rates are as follows:
Not all businesses are taxed in the same manner. Depending on the relative size and structure of a business, the tax method applied is assessed depending on real (or actual) profits or deemed profits.
## Real profit method
In Lebanon, tax is charged on the total income or profits derived in Lebanon. Based on the income tax law and the principle of territoriality, the main premise for considering a profit to have been realised in Lebanon is if it was generated through an effort or activity exerted in Lebanon.
The tax base (the determination of profits) and the tax rates differ between resident and non-resident taxpayers.
For resident corporate entities, CIT is computed at 17% based on the taxpayer’s accounting profits after adjustments resulting from tax rules through the schedule of accounting-to-tax calculation.
The use of the real profit method is mandatory for the following:
Small entities may choose voluntarily to be subject to the real profit method; however, once they choose the real profit method, they cannot revert back to the deemed profit method.
Concerning tax on non-residents, WHT applies at 2.25% on payments for goods and 7.5% on payments for services. As per the 2022 Budget Law, this tax will be due on a quarterly basis within 15 days from the end of each quarter instead of the annual submission done along with the income tax filing. In addition, the 2024 Budget Law increased the withholding tax rates to 3.4% on payments for goods and 8.5% on payments for services, applicable starting the second quarter of 2024 (i.e. 1 April 2024).
## Deemed profit method
A deemed profit method is imposed on insurance and savings institutions, taxable transport companies, oil refineries, and public work contractors.
Taxation is based on deemed profits and is levied at a flat rate of 17%.
The rate of deemed profit for public work contractors, as approved by the MoF, is currently set at either 10% or 15% of total amounts collected per year, based on the type of activity performed by the contractor.
For insurance companies, the deemed profit rate ranges between 5% and 10%, depending on each insurance activity.
## Local income taxes
There are no governorate or local government taxes on income in Lebanon.

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are the following:
Salaries of foreign staff are normally subject to all contributions, except those for the end-of-service indemnity fund. However, foreign employees do not receive the family allowance benefits nor do they benefit from the medical reimbursements.
On February 1, 2024, the NSSF issued Memorandum no. 740 whereby it set the exchange rate to be used for the conversion of the salaries paid in foreign currencies to the highest official exchange rate published by the Central Bank (currently LL 89,500/USD 1).
In addition, starting March 2024, the Council of Ministers enacted Decree no. 12962 which increased the monthly ceiling amounts for sickness and maternity social security contributions to be 5 times the minimum monthly wage.
## Consumption taxes
### **Value-added tax (VAT)**
Mandatory registration applies to importers and exporters regardless of their turnover, while voluntary registration applies to the taxable persons who achieve a turnover exceeding LL 100 million over a period of one to 4 consecutive quarters.
Those wishing to benefit from special cases of recovery of tax with regards to exempt transactions  shall apply a classification request to the Directorate of Value Added Tax to obtain a registration number and open a tax account allowing the submission of the refund requests.
Classified taxpayers are entitled to submit the refund request starting from the tax period during which they were classified until 31 December, once a year within a period of 20 days from the end of the calendar year, provided that the total refunded VAT amount is not less than LL 50 million (as per the 2022 Budget Law). Any additional amount will be carried forward to next year. The amount less than LL 5 million is carried forward to the following year.
The standard VAT rate in Lebanon is 11%. Unless specifically exempt, VAT is levied on all commercial transactions undertaken by business entities. Export of goods and services and export-related services, international transport, and some of the intermediate operations are zero-rated. Banking, financial services, and insurance operations are exempt from VAT.
The activities performed by nurseries from VAT are now exempt from VAT as per Article 56 of Budget Law 2019.
Sales of yachts, other boats, and pleasure craft with a length of more than 15 metres belonging to non-Lebanese also benefit now from the VAT exemption as per Article 65 of Budget Law 2019. The article also included diesel oil as goods exempt from VAT.
According to the 2022 budget law, fuel, industrial equipment, raw materials used in manufacturing and agriculture are exempt from VAT until 31 December 2024. Solar power equipment used to generate electricity are also exempt from VAT from 15 November 2022 until 31 December 2023 .
Any person who independently provides taxable or zero-rated supplies in the course of an economic activity and has a turnover that exceeds LL 150 million over four successive quarters becomes liable for VAT registration.
On 27 April 2023, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) published Decree no. 11230 in the Official Gazette, whereby Article 18 of the VAT Law no. 7308, which states that VAT should be calculated following the official exchange rate, was replaced to mention that in instances where the price of the service or good is denominated in foreign currency, and until a unified exchange rate is set, the counter value of the foreign currency to be used for VAT calculation purposes should be Sayrafa rate.
Subsequently, on 15 February 2024, the 2024 Budget Law was published in the Official Gazette which introduced the following amendments.
1. Any taxable person who achieves a total turnover  in excess of  LL 5 billion over a period of one to four consecutive quarters must register for VAT.
2. Taxable persons whose total turnover was between LL 100 million and LL 5 billion during any of  the years 2020 to 2023, are no longer required to register for VAT, and may submit a request to deregister in case they have already registered for VAT.
3. Persons whose turnover didn’t reach the threshold for voluntary registration and who engaged in contracts with governmental institutions involving transactions subject to VAT or exempt with the right to deduct VAT, can apply for registration with the VAT department if their total turnover exceeds LL 5 billion over one to four consecutive quarters.
4. Importers and exporters should register for VAT irrespective of their turnover.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Lebanon.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Estate and gift tax rates vary from 3% to 45%, depending on the amount received and the affinity to the deceased or donor after deducting special exemptions applicable to estate beneficiaries. These tax rates apply cumulatively to all gifts and inheritances made by a specific donor to a specific recipient.
Aids, grants and subsidies received from public funds as well as donations up to LL 14.4 million are exempt from all duties, unless the donee is a non-profit organisation, a sports association, educational, artistic or religious organisation, then the exemption should not exceed LL 900 million as per Article 57 of Budget Law 2022.
Inheritance tax rates and exemptions are amended as per Article 56 and 59 of Budget Law 2022.
Inheritance tax rates were further amended as per Article 50 of the 2024 Budget Law.
## Built property tax (BPT)
The BPT is an annual progressive tax, ranging between 4% and 14%, on built property.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the net income brackets subject to built property tax effective starting the year 2022. The brackets were further amended as per the 2024 Budget Law.
## Registration taxes
When transferring ownership of real estate, registration fees of approximately 6% are applicable. As of 26 October 2017, a 2% fee is considered part of the registration fee and should be paid within 15 days from the date the contract was concluded. The real estate should be registered during one year; otherwise, the 2% paid will no longer be recoverable.
## Stamp duty
Two kinds of stamp duties are levied. A proportionate stamp duty of 0.4% is levied on all deeds and contracts (written or implied) that mention specific payments or other sums of money. A fixed stamp duty ranging between a minimum of LL 1,000 and a maximum of LL 2 million is applicable on documents in accordance with schedules appended to the stamp duty law.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that the fixed stamp duty due on invoices, receipts and debit and credit notes should be settled through monthly declarations within 15 days after the end of the month starting 1 January 2023.
The Ministry of Finance issued Decision no. 684 on 23 November 2023 to clarify that the Sayrafa rate is the exchange rate that should be used to convert the value of contracts and deeds (and any other similar documentation) denominated in foreign currency into the local currency (LL) for the purpose of calculating the respective stamp duty.
The 2024 Budget Law amended the Stamp Duty Law to state that; provided the stamp duty fee does not exceed LL 3 billion, the duty can be processed by marking machines operated by authorised individuals.
In addition, the 2024 Budget Law increased the fixed amount of stamp duty LL 100,000 on contracts that do not contain a specific amount and LL 20,000 on unpaid invoices.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## WHT on interest
The income, revenues, and interest earned from accounts opened at Lebanese banks and from treasury bonds are subject to a 7% WHT that is non-refundable and cannot be carried forward. The interest rate is increased from 7% to 10% for three years as of the date Law no. 144 (Budget Law for 2019) was published (i.e. 31 July 2019), after which the 7% rate is applied again.
## WHT on dividends
Tax is withheld from dividends paid to resident and non-resident shareholders/partners at a rate of 10%.
## Movable capital WHT
A 10% WHT is levied on income derived from movable capital generated in Lebanon. Taxable income is comprised of the following:
##
Moreover, the MoF issued Decisions no. 322 and 323 dated 15 May 2023 related to tax on foreign movable capital income and the tax treatment of gains on disposal of shares or parts in joint stock and limited liability companies respectively.
## Non-resident WHT
Revenues earned by non-residents in Lebanon are subject to an effective WHT of 2.25% on revenue from the sale of materials and equipment, and 7.5% on the revenue in the case of sale of services.
As per the 2022 Budget Law the deadline for the declaration of the non-resident tax to be due on a quarterly basis within 15 days from the end of each quarter instead of the annual submission done along with the income tax filing.
The 2024 Budget Law specifies that non-resident tax should be settled in the same currency as the payment made to the non-resident party. In addition, the Law amended the withholding tax rates to be 3.4% on goods and 8.5% on services. This amendment becomes effective starting Q2-FY24.
## Petroleum rights WHT
New decisions have been issued related to the tax petroleum law.
Decision No. 2043/1, dated 31 December 2018 (which relates to the application of Section 2, Article 10 of Law no. 57 dated 5 October 2017), states that companies that hold petroleum rights and operating petroleum rights, operating companies that do not hold rights, subcontractors, and secondary contracting parties must withhold the tax declared and remit it to the tax authorities on a quarterly basis. Taxpayers should obtain a registration number for every non-resident party they are dealing with through a specific form used for this purpose.
On the other hand, Decision No. 2044/1, dated 31 December 2018 (which relates to the application of Section 3 and 4, Article 13 of Law no. 57 dated 5 October 2017), refers to the tax obligations of employees working in Lebanon for a non-resident party and of employers contracting with non-residents to engage in petroleum activities or supply services and materials for such persons in Lebanon.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
DTTs provide the following WHT benefits. Note that treaty rates do not override lower non-treaty rates. Treaty members may take advantage of the non-treaty rates.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Inventory valuation
For tax purposes, inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method.
## Capital gains
Note that income from disposal of shares realised by a company whose main activity is the acquisition of investments is subject to 17% CIT.
## Dividend income
Dividends received as a result of a taxable person’s activity are deemed trading income and are subject to 17% CIT. Dividends received as passive income are subject to 10% tax in Lebanon. However, dividends received from Lebanese entities are exempt from CIT, as the dividend tax is withheld at source, but are not exempt from further tax upon distribution from the recipient entity.
### **Stock dividends**
The Lebanese law is silent on the tax implications of stock dividends. However, when share capital is increased by reducing retained earnings, no tax is applicable.
## Interest income
Interest earned by corporations is considered as a tax deductible expense starting 27 October 2017. No more relief is given on the WHT suffered on bank accounts, treasury bills, and bonds. The interest earned prior to 26 October 2017 is added to the taxable income.
The tax on interest revenue is set at 7% since the issuance of Law no. 64, dated 26 October 2017.
## Rental income
Rental income should be deducted from the accounting result to reach the taxable result. Moreover, expenses related to property that is rented out should be added back to the accounting result to reach the taxable result.
On 21 December 2023, the Ministry of Finance issued Decision no. 880 outlining the criteria for determining rental income subject to income tax resulting from rental services. The Decision stated that revenues earned by taxpayers who are subject to real profit-based taxation will be subject to income tax on revenues generated from rental services in the following two scenarios:
1. Taxpayers who own or invest in commercial communities (shopping centres), where they allocate portions of the real estate/spaces for commercial or residential use by others.  This obligation remains regardless of the contractual agreement in place, whether it's a free management agreement or lease agreement and whether these taxpayers conduct their commercial activities within the shopping centres or solely invest in them through subleasing to others.
2. Taxpayers whose ownership or investment in buildings, real estate, or areas constitutes their only or primary business activity, regardless of whether additional services (such as secretarial and telecommunications services) are included in their activities or not.
Taxpayers subject to real profit-based taxation who generate revenues from rental services remain subject to built property tax in all the cases not mentioned above, , such as when renting is considered an incidental or secondary activity. All other taxpayers, not subject to tax based on real profit, generating rental income remain subject to built property tax.
A BPT is paid on rental income at progressive rates ranging between 4% and 14%.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the net income brackets subject to built property tax starting the year 2022 which was further amended as per the 2024 Budget Law starting the year 2024 to range between LL 1.2 billion and LL 6 billion. The annual exemption also increased to LL 360 million starting 2024 onwards for each residential property.
## Royalties income
Royalties received by a holding company from Lebanese companies for patents and the like are taxed at a rate of 10%. Royalties received by holding companies from abroad are exempt from tax.
Royalties received by other than holding companies are taxed as ordinary income at 17%.
## Unrealised exchange gains/losses
Unrealised exchange gains and losses are not treated differently from any other gain or loss for tax purposes (i.e. unrealised exchange gains are subject to CIT at 17% and unrealised exchange losses are deductible for CIT purposes).
As per Law no 330 issued 5 December 2024, taxpayers have the obligation to adjust their accounting records annually starting 2022 until 31 December 2026 by applying the exchange rate set by the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL) at the end of each year on their receivables, payables, cash and bank accounts.
Positive and negative differences of exchange resulting from this adjustment should not impact the taxable result at year end (excluding those related to salaries).
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are not taxed on foreign-source income derived from activities carried out abroad through foreign branches.

# Lebanon
## Overview
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
The Republic of Lebanon is situated in the Levant on the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, with Syria to the north and east. Lebanon is divided into six governorates, with Beirut as the capital. The official language is Arabic, and the currency is the Lebanese pound (LBP or LL).
Lebanon has a long tradition of domestic free trade and investment policies, with free market pricing for most goods and services. The Lebanese economy is service-oriented, and its main growth sectors include banking and tourism.
However, since October 2019, the country has been going through a freefall in economy and de facto capital control restrictions. Even though the Lebanese pound currency is still pegged to the United States dollar (USD) at USD 1 = LL 1,507.50 since 1997, the Lebanese currency has been unofficially devalued for more than 95% of its value since the end of 2019, leading to severe economic consequences and historical inflation rates.
Due to political instability, the real gross domestic product (GDP) witnessed a decrease of 6.6% in 2024, according to the World Bank.
Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and the League of Arab States and is a member of all international organizations under the auspices of the United Nations (e.g. UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Fund for Agricultural Development), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (i.e. the World Bank) and its affiliates (i.e. the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the International Development Association (IDA).

## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
In response to the hyperinflation in the country, the Ministry of Labor (“MoL”) and the National Social Security Fund (“NSSF”) issued several decrees and circulars during 2022 and early 2023 to adjust the salaries of employees subject to the Labor Law as well as the family allowance given.
The 2022 Budget Law no. 10 published in the Official Gazette on 15 November 2022  and the 2024 Budget Law no. 324 published 15 February 2024 both simultaneously introduced several amendments related to taxes, incentives and exemptions applicable in Lebanon. Law no. 324 specified as well that “employers should withhold payroll tax from employees' wages and remit it to the tax administration in the same currency as the salaries paid.”
Additionally, the 2022 Budget Law outlined that whenever the statement “taxes and duties are due in US Dollars or in any other foreign currency” is mentioned, the amount should be deposited/settled in the same currency to the Ministry of Finance “MoF” bank account held at the Central Bank of Lebanon. Consequently, the 2024 Budget Law no. 324 stated that except for amounts due to the Lebanese State or to public institutions in foreign currencies, as well as taxes and fees on revenues, interests, and proceeds received in foreign currencies (e.g. income subject to movable capital tax), all other taxes, duties, and related penalties that are due in foreign currency to the tax authorities are required to be paid in Lebanese pounds based on the actual value set by the Central Bank.
The major tax amendments and exemptions are incorporated in the appropriate summary sections.
Moreover, the MoF issued Law no.330 on 5 December 2024 which addresses the exceptional revaluation of fixed assets and inventory as well as the effect of devaluation of the Lebanese Pound on the value of inventory and fixed assets. The Law also outlined the exceptional treatment of the forex exchange from the adjustment of the LBP devaluation effect on receivables, payables and cash & bank accounts.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Tax is levied on all corporeal/natural and incorporeal/artificial persons, resident in Lebanon or outside, on all profits that they generate in Lebanon. The main premise for considering profits to have been realised in Lebanon is when such profits have occurred from an effort exerted in Lebanon, irrespective of the identity of the taxpayer or place of residency.
Tax is levied on profits generated by two categories of taxpayers: resident taxpayers and non-resident taxpayers.
## Resident taxpayers
The Lebanese Parliament legislated a new Law no. 60, dated 3 November 2016, relating to the amendment of Law no. 44, Tax Residency in Lebanon, including that any company is considered tax resident in Lebanon if it has:
## Non-resident taxpayers
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Based on the Lebanese income tax laws and regulations, every person, establishment or company that satisfies either of the following two conditions (listed below), even if not resident in Lebanon, is considered, no matter the length of the period, to be resident in it for tax purposes (i.e. having a permanent establishment (“PE”) in Lebanon):
1. Has an office or a fixed place of business in its name in Lebanon even when it is not undertaking its business activity in a normal and repetitive manner;
2. Is practising a profession or business activity in a normal or repetitive manner even if it does not have a known registered place of business in Lebanon.
Decree no. 3692 dated 12 July 2016 clarified the definition of a "non-resident" which also provided additional insights into what would constitute a PE from a Lebanese perspective. The main criteria introduced was the “provision of taxable services in a normal and repetitive manner” through individuals in Lebanon will constitute a PE. The term "normal and repetitive manner" indicates that the person provides taxable activities for more than once during a 12-month period.
The Decree also clarified that the term “place to practise the profession” means any location used by the taxpayer (owned, rented or put at his disposal) for a period exceeding 6 months in any 12-month period for public or private works and for a period exceeding 3 months for the remaining activities.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Net income derived from a branch’s operations in Lebanon is subject to Lebanese CIT, levied under the real profit method at a rate of 17%. Taxable profits of foreign branch offices are deemed to be distributed on a yearly basis and are subject to a dividend distribution tax at the rate of 10%.
## Representative offices
Representative offices do not pay CIT as long as they do not carry out commercial activities. Representative offices are required to submit annual tax declarations along with detailed company information that includes employee information, a balance sheet, an income statement, a non-resident tax schedule, and a schedule of payments to professionals. The declaration, with all relevant documentation, should be submitted as one single set. All the information included should be based on accounting records. The deadline for submitting the declaration depends on the legal form of the parent company (i.e. before 1 June of the following year for SAL or SARL companies and before 1 May of the following year for others).
The 2022 Budget Law states that nonresident tax will be due on a quarterly basis within 15 days from the end of each quarter instead of the annual submission done along with the income tax filing.

# Lebanon
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
There are no specific regulations concerning foreign tax credit in Lebanon.
## Holding companies
Lebanese holding companies are exempt from CIT and from WHT on dividends. However, they are subject to a tax on their paid-up capital and reserves. In any given tax year, total tax payments on paid-up capital and reserves are capped at LL 50 million starting fiscal year 2022 as per the 2022 Budget Law instead of LL 5 million.
Interest, management fees, and royalties received by holding companies from abroad are exempt from tax in Lebanon.
Holding companies are subject to a 10% tax on interest received from loans granted for a period of less than three years to companies operating in Lebanon. Management fees received by the holding company from companies operating in Lebanon are subject to a 5% tax. Capital gains on financial assets in Lebanese companies held for less than two years are subject to a 15% tax. Royalties received from Lebanese companies for patents and the like are taxed at a rate of 10%.
## Offshore companies
Offshore companies are exempt from CIT and from the WHT on dividends, and are instead subject to a lump-sum annual tax of LL 50 million starting fiscal year 2022 as per the 2022 Budget Law instead of LL 1 million. Contracts related to offshore activities outside Lebanon are exempt from Lebanese stamp duty.
Offshore companies are required to be registered as SAL companies and, with a few exceptions, are subject to the same regulations as a SAL company. The business objectives of an offshore company are limited.
## Permanent exemptions from CIT
Companies and organisations that are granted an indefinite exemption from CIT include the following:
##
## Reinvestment incentives
Industrial companies using operating profit to finance certain capital investments are exempt from up to 50% of their CIT liabilities for a period of up to four years, provided that such exemptions do not exceed the original investments made. In areas designated ‘development zones’, 75% of a company’s tax liabilities may be exempt.
In order to take advantage of this regulation, investments should consist of capital expenditures designed to increase a company’s manufacturing capacity or of investments in housing facilities for the company’s staff and other employees.
Incentives for companies established in specific areas
As per the 2022 Budget Law, companies established in specific areas after the date of issuance of the Law (i.e 15 November 2022) and until 31 December 2024, operating in specific regions that the Government wishes to develop are exempt from Income Tax Law for 7 years following the initiation of its activities. Such companies may benefit from an exemption on construction license fees and a 50% reduction on registration and annual traffic fees of its vehicles for the same period of 7 years.
To benefit from this tax exemption, the company’s capital should not be less than USD 1 million transferred from foreign funds or paid in cash and at least 60% of its employees are Lebanese nationals with a minimum of 50 Lebanese nationals.
## Incentives granted by the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon (IDAL)
In its role as national investment promotion agency, the IDAL offers, through its Investment Law no.360, a series of financial and non-financial incentives to investment projects in various sectors. There are two incentive schemes that investors can choose from:
Incentives for large scale projects: The Package Deal Contract (PDC) Scheme
The PDC is a contract between the Lebanese government and the investor through which local and foreign investors alike can receive the following incentives:
### **Incentives for small and medium enterprise (SME) projects: The Investment Project by Zone (IPZ) Scheme**
##
The above-mentioned exemptions are granted based on the following criteria:

# Lebanon
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Foreign ownership of real estate restrictions
The following restrictions apply to foreign ownership of real estate:
## Choice of business entity
Lebanon’s commercial law provides for a range of business entities available to both local and foreign investors. These consist of the following:
Legal structures commonly used by foreigners in conducting business in Lebanon are SALs, SARLs, and branch offices.
### Joint-stock companies (Société anonyme libanaise or SAL)
Lebanese joint-stock companies are permitted to engage in all kinds of business activity. Shareholders of a SAL have no liability beyond their actual capital subscriptions.
With a small number of exceptions (such as real estate companies and banks), there are no limits on the amount of capital that can be held by foreign investors.
The management of a SAL is entrusted to a board of directors with a minimum of three and a maximum of 12 members. The majority of board members must be Lebanese, but the chairman may be a foreign national.
Certain types of businesses, such as banks and insurance companies, are required to incorporate as joint-stock companies.
The minimum capital is LBP 30 million, and the applicable CIT rate is 17%, in addition to a WHT on dividends of 10%.
### Limited liability companies (Société à responsabilité limitée or SARL)
Members of a limited liability company are partners, and the company's capital is divided into parts rather than shares. Partners are liable only to the extent of their parts, and individual partners' claims on the company's capital are fixed in the partnership deed.
All partners may be foreigners, with the exception of companies seeking to engage in commercial representation.
Limited liability companies may not be active in certain sectors of the economy, such as in insurance, banking, fund management, or air transportation.
The transfer of parts in a limited liability company is subject to the consent of partners representing at least three-quarters of the capital. Existing partners enjoy priority in the purchase of parts offered for transfer.
A limited liability company is managed by one or several directors (managers) who may or may not be selected from among the partners.
The minimum capital is LBP 5 million, and the applicable CIT rate is 17%, in addition to a WHT on dividends of 10%.
## Intellectual property (IP)
The law in Lebanon does not contain a clear definition of author’s rights. It protects all products of the human intellect whether written, pictorial, sculptural, scriptural, or oral, regardless of its value, importance, destination, or form of expression.
The law provides patent protection for inventions and plant varieties and a *sui generis* protection for layout designs of integrated circuits. Furthermore, the law provides protection for undisclosed information. According to an assessment conducted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in July 2002, the Patent law is in complete conformity with the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). It was also pointed out that the provisions of the Plant Varieties exceed the minimum requirements of the TRIPS Agreement.
The law does not explicitly protect notorious trademarks and geographical indications. However, those are provided protection via Lebanon’s membership to the Paris Convention. Moreover, geographical indications are provided protection under the provisions of the Law on Customs, the Law on Fraud Control, and the Criminal Law.
The copyright protection originally available to literary and artistic works is now extended to computer software, video films, and all kind of audio-visual works. The law provides stiffer penalties for offenders and better compensation to the persons whose rights have been infringed. The manner in which the copyright is breached has also been extended.
## Exchange of information agreements
The Lebanese Parliament legislated a new Law no. 55, dated 27 October 2016, relating to the implementation and execution of exchange of information agreements used for tax purposes. Under Law no. 55, exchange can occur under several scenarios. Exchange of Information on Request (EIOR) or Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) based on the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) or in the context of signed DTTs. This legislation authorised the Finance Minister of Lebanon on behalf of the Lebanese government to sign the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) and the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on Automatic Exchange on Financial Account Information related to the commitment to the implementation of CRS. Under the EIOR approach and upon receiving a request to share information, the Lebanese Competent Authority will assist the requesting country based on the agreement signed. It has the right to request additional information before sharing the information or reject the request in case it conflicts with the signed agreement. Failure to abide by this legislation will result in penalties ranging from LBP 100 million to LBP 200 million. These penalties are in addition to penalties set by the related regulatory authorities. It is worth noting that information exchanged under the AEOI and EIOR, each under the related agreement or this legislation, will be treated as confidential/secret as per Article no. 25 of the Tax Procedure Law.
On 12 May 2017, the MAC and the MCAA were officially signed by the Lebanese authorities. On 7 July 2017, the CRS guidance notes were issued in the Official Gazette under Decree No. 1022. On 25 October 2017, under Circular No. 3222/LMD/2017, the Insurance Control Commission (ICC) issued the CRS guidance notes to help the insurance companies implement the CRS requirements.
It’s worth noting that, recently, tax evasion has been defined under Article 57 of Budget Law 2019. Tax evasion is the deliberate action of a taxpayer to undeclare one's taxes and fees due to the government through the use of illegal methods. The law included a list of examples:

Last reviewed - 09 January 2025

## Lump sum license fee
A new Decision no. 993/1, dated 21 November 2016, relating to imposing an annual lump sum license fee was introduced. The annual lump sum license fee for individual taxpayers assessed based on real profit is LBP 550,000, for individual taxpayers assessed based on deemed profits is LBP 250,000, and for taxpayers assessed on assumed profits is LBP 50,000. The above-mentioned license fees apply to local head offices, branches, outlets, and to any place in which the taxpayer carries on its activity or receives customers. For income tax purposes, the lump sum license fee is considered as a non-deductible expense.
Decision No. 260/1, dated 31 May 2019, states that, as of FY 2021, the annual lump sum fee will be applicable for all taxpayers subject to income tax as per the above.
## Principal forms of doing business
Lebanon's commercial law provides for a range of business entities available to both local and foreign investors. These are:
Joint ventures are commonly used for specific projects in the construction industry and other sectors, but are not recognised as separate corporate entities under local laws.
Although local commercial law is based on the French model, no mechanism exists for an individual or legal entity to incorporate himself or itself. One-shareholder companies are not allowed. The use of nominee share holdings, on the other hand, is commonly accepted practice. Unless Lebanese shares nominees are used to circumvent minimum local shareholding requirements (in real estate for example), the authorities do not normally object to their use.
With only a few exceptions in areas such as commercial representation, real estate, insurance, and banking, foreign investors are allowed to own 100% in a Lebanese company. Investors may acquire shares of existing local firms or establish their own companies in Lebanon. Every legal entity established in Lebanon will be treated as a Lebanese company.
Legal structures commonly used by foreigners in conducting business in Lebanon are SAL, SARL, and branch offices.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Under the income tax law in Lebanon, tax is levied based on income type. Accordingly, the income tax law divides income into the following three categories:
The income tax law does not deal with what is known as global tax on income, where a progressive tax is levied on the individual's income grouped from different sources. Accordingly, where a taxpayer has income from different sources, each type of income will be taxed according to the tax chapter it falls under.
## Employment income
Income tax is imposed on all salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, life annuities, pension payments, and other benefits in cash and kind derived by employees.
Certain types of income, such as those received by certain diplomatic representatives and nursing staff, are exempt from income tax.
### Stock options
The tax treatment of employee stock option benefits is not directly addressed in the income tax law or in its explanatory memos. In general, the benefit is a salary related benefit and is subject to tax in Lebanon. The benefit will be subject to social security contributions if it meets the criteria of continuity, consistency, and collectivity. The time at which a charge to tax or social security contributions can arise is shown below:
## Moveable capital income
A WHT at a rate of 10% is levied on an income derived from moveable capital generated in Lebanon. Such taxable income is comprised of:
Individuals are exempt from capital gains tax on the transfer of shares.
Decision no. 323, issued on 15 May 2023, stated that individuals are subject to 10% movable capital tax if they dispose of shares in Lebanese or foreign limited liability companies when the disposal of shares does not represent a commercial transaction for the seller.
In addition, Decision no. 322, issued on 15 May 2023, defined the application procedures of Article no. 87 of the Budget Law of 2022 related to tax on foreign movable capital income stating that taxes on income from foreign shares, bonds, and other foreign movable capital should be settled in foreign currency starting 15 November 2022.
## Business income
Any individual of Lebanese or foreign nationality may engage in a business activity as a sole proprietor or become a partner in an existing or newly formed partnership. Under Lebanese law, there are two distinct types of partnerships, general partnerships and limited partnerships.
Sole proprietorships and general partnerships are taxed at progressive rates. Article 24 of Budget Law 2019 amended Article 32 on the Income Tax Law related to the annual progressive brackets for income tax on profits to become 4% to 25% instead of 4% to 21%. These rates are applicable starting from the year 2019.
The 2022 Budget Law amended the annual progressive brackets for income tax profits applicable starting 1 January 2022.
Limited partnerships are taxed at a flat rate of 17%.
