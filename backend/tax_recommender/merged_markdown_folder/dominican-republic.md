# Dominican Republic
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## WHT on dividends
Dividends paid in cash to resident and non-resident individuals or corporations are subject to a WHT of 10%.
## WHT on transfers of shares
There is a 1% WHT on the value of the transfer of shares received by the seller in regard to transactions between local entities. Even though transactions between foreign entities are not subject to the 1% WHT, they are subject to capital gain tax.
Such WHT is a payment on account against capital gain tax, payable by the seller through the Form IR-2 (legal entities) or Form IR-1 (individuals), as applicable. However, if they can substantiate that the transaction will not generate a capital gain or that the 1% WHT would generate a capital loss, they may request of the tax authorities, no later than 30 days prior to withholding filing/payment's due date, to be exempt from this obligation.
This 1% WHT should be filed and paid to the tax authorities through the monthly WHT return (IR-17 Form) within the first ten days of the month following the payment to the seller. In case the purchaser is an individual, the 1% WHT is not applicable.
## WHT on interest payments
Financial institutions are appointed as 1% WHT agents on the value paid or credited on account for interest payments of any nature to legal entities.
The interests paid by financial institutions will constitute a deductible expense for tax purposes, provided the WHT was made.
In addition, this rule obligates financial institutions to provide a monthly electronic file, directly to the tax authorities or through the Banks Superintendency, containing all the information related to the interest payment, including the date, value, and identity of the beneficiary.
## WHT on payments to foreign corporations
The WHT on payments to foreign corporations, which are not permanently established in the Dominican Republic, are as follows:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends and interest | Royalties | Technical assistance | Other services |
| Non-treaty | 10 | 27 | 27 | 27 |
| Treaty: |  |  |  |  |
| Canada | 0/10 (1) | 18 | 27 | 27 |
| Spain | 0/10 (2) | Up to 10 | N/A | Up to 10 |
Notes
1. 0% or 10% depending on the type of ownership since the Canada-Dominican Republic Treaty contains the more beneficiary treaty clause.
2. 0% or 10% depending on if the Spanish parent company has more than 75% participation in the Dominican subsidiary. Branches are not subject to profit remittance tax.

# Dominican Republic
## Overview
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
The Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces and one National District. Its capital is Santo Domingo. The official language of the Dominican Republic is Spanish, and the currency is the Dominican peso (DOP).
The Dominican Republic has long been viewed primarily as an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco; however, in recent years, the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest employer, due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. The mining sector has also started a sustained period of growth. The economy is dependent upon the United States, which is the destination for nearly 50% of its exports. The Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007, boosting investment and exports, and reducing losses to the Asian garment industry.

# Dominican Republic
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
The Dominican Republic follows a territorial concept (i.e. resident companies, branches, and permanent establishments [PEs] are generally subject to taxation on Dominican-source income only); consequently, the tax treatment for corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies is similar in most aspects.
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 27%.
In addition, the 1% rate assets tax is considered an alternative minimal income tax, payable when the CIT is lower than the assets tax.
Dividends/profits remitted abroad or paid locally are subject to a withholding tax (WHT) of 10% as a definitive tax payment. Free trade zone (FTZ) entities should also make the 10% withholding on profit remittance (in case of branches) or dividend distribution (subsidiaries).
## Local income taxes
In the Dominican Republic, provincial and local government income taxes do not apply.

# Dominican Republic
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Tax on the Transfer of Industrialised Goods and Services (ITBIS) is a VAT applied to industrialised goods (movable) and services at a rate of 18%, with exemptions established by law to certain goods and services.
Exempt goods include a wide variety of goods, among which are basic products (eggs, milk, grains, live animals, frozen meats), seeds for planting, fruits and vegetables, medicine, insecticide and pesticides, books/magazines, educational material, wheelchairs, and prosthesis.
Exempt services include educational, health, financial (including insurance), pensions, ground transportation of people and cargo, electricity, water and waste pick-up, housing rental and personal care, and exported services.
A 0% rate applies to exports, including sales to FTZs.
## Tax on gross sales made by FTZs to local market
A 3.5% tax was created on the gross sales of goods and services made by companies in Dominican FTZs to individuals and legal entities in the local market.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are assessed at various rates depending on the nature of the goods and their country of origin. Free trade agreements exist (e.g. the Central America-Dominican Republic-US Free Trade Agreement [DR-CAFTA]) that decrease the customs duty rates for goods imported from the member countries.
## Selective consumption taxes (*Impuesto Selectivo al Consumo* or ISCs)
ISC is applied to the acquisition or import of certain goods and services.
There are ISCs that vary based on the product, which range from:
## Real Property Transfer Tax
The Real Property Transfer Tax is assessed at a basic rate of 3% on any transfer of ownership of real estate.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in the Dominican Republic.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to the social security contributions (*see below*), a 1% contribution from the payroll amount shall be made to the Governmental Training Institution (INFOTEP) on a monthly basis. This is paid solely by the employer (not subject to withholding). In addition, a 0.5% contribution shall be paid to INFOTEP, and the employer shall withhold said 0.5% contribution from employees’ bonus (not salary).
Employers must share 10% of their net profits with their employees. The Dominican Labor Code, however, allows employers to cap the amount distributed as follows: an employee with less than three years on the job will receive a maximum of 45 days’ salary; an employee with three years or more will receive a maximum of 60 days’ salary.
## Social security contributions
### Pensions
Employers contribute 7.10% of salaries and withhold 2.87% from employees’ salaries for pensions. The quotable salaries for contribution are 20 minimum wages.
### Family healthcare
Employers contribute 7.09% of salaries and withhold 3.04% from employees’ salaries for family healthcare. The quotable salaries for contribution are ten minimum wages.
### Labour risks insurance
Employers contribute 1.2% of salaries for labour risks insurance. The quotable salaries for contribution are four minimum wages.

# Dominican Republic
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
The Dominican Republic follows a territorial concept for the determination of taxable income. Dominican-source income is subject to tax, while foreign-source income is generally not. However, residents are subject to taxation on foreign investments and financial gains. In the case of individuals who become residents, this foreign-source income is taxed only after the third year.
## Personal income tax rates
Individuals pay tax on income in excess of 416,220 Dominican pesos (DOP). Personal income is taxed at the following rates (the scale is based on annual income):
| Taxable income (DOP) | | Tax on column 1 (DOP) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 416,220 | 0 | 0 |
| 416,220 | 624,329 | 0 | 15 |
| 624,329 | 867,123 | 31,216 | 20 |
| 867,123 | and above | 79,776 | 25 |
## Local income taxes
There are no other taxes payable on income in the Dominican Republic.

## Taxable period
The tax year-end is 31 December.
## Tax returns
Spouses are required to file separate income tax returns covering their respective incomes. Income from property held in common is included in the return of the husband, so it should not be included in the spouse’s return.
Individuals are required to file a personal tax return only when income from sources different from the salaries, wages, and bonuses (in which the employer makes withholdings) is received. If salaries are paid outside local payroll, individuals shall file a personal tax return. The personal tax return is due 31 March of the year after the tax year-end.
## Payment of tax
Employers are required to withhold income tax from employees’ remuneration on a monthly basis.
Tax on income from sources different from the salaries, wages, and bonuses received is due 31 March of the year after the tax year-end.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
A company is considered resident when it is registered or incorporated under the laws of the Dominican Republic. Foreign entities are considered as domiciled when they are registered in the Dominican Republic as a branch or PE, and they are subject to local tax in the same manner.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to local tax legislation, which follows the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, a PE is defined as a fixed place of business where a foreign entity or individual performs all or part of its activities, such as:

# Dominican Republic
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation allowances on fixed assets are determined by the declining-balance method at the following rates:
| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 5 |
| Office furniture, fixtures, computers, light vehicles, etc. | 25 |
| Other assets not specified | 15 |
The fiscal book value is adjusted by the annual inflation rate.
Amortisation of intangible assets (e.g. patents, author's rights, drawings, franchises, contracts without set expiration dates) is deductible as long as the amortisation of the fiscal cost of each intangible good, including patents, copyrights, drawings, models, contracts, and franchises whose life has a defined limit, should reflect the life of said good and the straight-line recovery method.
## Goodwill
## Start-up expenses
The Dominican tax legislation does not establish specific provisions regarding the deduction of start-up expenses. The general deductions rule is the accrual method.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible, provided they are associated with the acquisition, maintenance, and/or exploitation of taxable income generating assets.
The interest expense deduction is limited when the beneficiary is a non-resident located in a tax haven or in a low-taxation jurisdiction, or when the interest is not otherwise subject to tax by the recipient. Thin capitalisation rules may also limit the deduction (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible only in the year the loss is suffered. Authorisation may be obtained to use an alternative method, which consists of creating a provision allowing the deduction only in the year the bad debts qualify as doubtful, up to 4% of the balance of the accounts receivable at year-end.
## Charitable contributions
Donations made are tax deductible in the Dominican Republic, up to 5% of the taxable income and if the beneficiaries are registered charitable contributions.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are considered non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible. Other taxes can be deductible; however, interest and surcharges imposed on taxes are not deductible in general.
## Other significant items
For tax purposes, the following significant items should be considered:
## Net operating losses
The carryforward of losses of legal entities can be used to offset profits up to the fifth year following the year in which the losses were generated, with a maximum amortisation of 20% in each year. For the fourth year, the deduction allowed should not exceed 80% of the net taxable income. In the fifth year, the percentage is 70%.
There is no carryback loss mechanism in the Dominican Republic.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates for royalties, interest, or service fees are deductible, provided that the 27% WHT was paid (10% on interest).

# Dominican Republic
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in the Dominican Republic.
## Transfer pricing
Per the Dominican Tax Code (DTC), related-party transactions carried out between Dominican companies, regardless of whether the companies are foreign-owned or not, or with companies located in areas of low or no taxation, must be carried out in accordance with the prices agreed in the transfer of goods or services between independent parties.
These provisions shall also apply to transactions carried out by Dominican companies with related companies located in the country that is benefiting from a favourable tax regime.
The tax authorities, following the procedures in the current tax laws in the exercise of its powers of determination, verification, or investigation, may challenge the values declared by taxpayers if such values:
Persons are considered related parties or related persons or entities, resident or not in the Dominican Republic, when among them there is a financial dependency or capital of both is mostly owned by one of them, following (but not limited to) these criteria:
Regarding the advance pricing agreement (APA) regime, an APA may be requested from the tax authorities that sets the values of the transactions carried out between related parties if made prior to completion. Please note the following:
Finally, taxpayers must file an annual Informative Tax Return of transactions between related parties, which shall contain detailed information of each transaction, the related party's identification, transfer pricing method, etc.
## Thin capitalisation
According to the thin capitalisation rule, the maximum debt-to-equity ratio allowed to taxpayers is 3:1; over this threshold, the deduction of interest expense is limited.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The Dominican Republic does not have provisions for CFCs.

# Dominican Republic
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
In the Dominican Republic, tax incentive laws exist for the following.
## Tourism incentives
Law 158-01 on the Promotion of Tourist Development for New or Low Development Locations in Provinces and Areas with Great Tourist Potential, and for the Creation of the Tourist Promotion Official Fund, enacted on 9 October 2001, establishes special incentives and benefits to individuals or companies, residing in the Dominican Republic, that promote or invest capital in any tourist activity described in said Law. In order to benefit from said Law, a special Resolution shall be obtained from the Council for the Promotion of Tourism. Law No. 195-13 added other areas that could benefit from the tax incentives established in Law 158-01.
## Alternative energy incentives
Law 57-07 provides significant incentives for the use and development of renewable sources of energy. The renewable energy sources subject to this law include bio-fuel, bio-diesel, ethanol, and wind, solar, and other renewable energy.
Additionally, the credit on investment expense granted to self-power producers is 40%.
## Industrial renovation and modernisation incentives
## Industrial FTZ operations
Law 8-90 about Export FTZs was created to promote employment, production, and economic growth. Entities that would like to benefit from said Law shall be engaged in manufacture/service within a confined space (FTZ park). Special FTZ classification entities, which are entities located outside an FTZ park (e.g. call centres), were abolished with Law No. 253-12. In addition to this, Law 253-12 taxed dividends paid by FTZ entities.
## Border development incentives
Law No. 28-01, dated 1 February 2001, creates a special development frontier zone for industrial, agro-industrial, agriculture/livestock, metalmechanic, FTZ, tourism, metallurgical, and energy companies that exist at the time of promulgation of said law, and those that may be installed in the future within the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Main incentives include 100% exemption on CIT and VAT, as well as customs duties.
## Foreign tax credit
Taxes paid abroad on foreign income taxed in the Dominican Republic may be credited up to the amount of the Dominican tax liability generated by such income. The credits should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Personal deductions
### Education expenses
Individuals (who are income taxpayers) may deduct educational expenses incurred by them and their direct dependant non-wage earners from gross income subject to tax. Educational expenses include those incurred in connection with elementary, medium, technical, and university education. The deduction is allowed only up to 10% of gross taxable income.
Other non-business expenses are not deductible.
## Standard deductions
Residents have a standard deduction of DOP 416,220 annually, as of 2021, which is adjusted by the annual inflation rates. Christmas bonuses, severance, and pre-notice payments are tax exempt.
## Business deductions
Individuals performing commercial or industrial activities can deduct expenses incurred in the production of business activities, whether or not they keep organised accounting records. Otherwise, they have the option to deduct 40% on the gross revenue as total deductions to get the net taxable income. In these cases, the standard/fixed deduction is not applicable.

# Dominican Republic
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Employment income
Broadly, the entire remuneration in cash for personal services rendered in the Dominican Republic is subject to income tax, except Christmas bonus, contributions to the social security system, severance, and pre-notice payments. Non-cash compensations given to officers or employees by companies (compensations in kind) are taxed at a rate of 27% (Fringe Benefit Tax or FBT), which is undertaken by the company. These compensations include car, housing, relocation allowances expenses, club memberships, etc. However, the calculation for the FBT on vehicles is different. The table shown below includes the percentages that should be taken into account.
| Calculation of FBT on vehicles | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership of vehicle | Assigned to habitual working employee | Personal use (%) | Values subject to proportionality |
| Employer or rented to third party | In the office | 40 | Depreciation or rent, fuel, insurance, etc. |
| Employer or rented to third party | Outside the office | 20 |
| Employee | In the office | 20 | Fuel, repairs and maintenance, insurance, etc. |
| Employee | Outside the office | 10 |
The company must pay taxes for this compensation on a monthly basis. This tax is required in order to consider these expenses as deductible.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed as ordinary taxable income and are determined by deducting the fiscal cost from the sale amount.
## Dividend income
Cash dividends are exempt, provided the 10% WHT was applied by the entity.
Shares dividends are also exempt.
## Interest income
Interest received by resident individuals from time deposits, savings accounts, and other sources that is received from financial institutions in the Dominican Republic is tax exempt.
