## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
Mauritanian companies are taxed in accordance with the territoriality principle. Consequently, companies that carry out their activities outside of Mauritania will not be taxed in Mauritania for those profits. However, foreign companies (resident and non-resident) are subject to Mauritanian CIT for their Mauritanian source of benefit, and the profit realised from services and goods exportation from Mauritanian companies will be taxed in Mauritania.
The CIT rate is 25% of the net taxable profit or 2% of the income listed in article 8 excepted transfers and reversals of charges if the latter amount is higher than the former.
The normal real regime of profit companies is subject to a minimum payment of 100,000 Mauritanian ouguiya (MRU).
## Property income tax
The incomes from built-up property (e.g. houses, factories, shops, or offices), from non-built property (regardless of their nature), from subletting built and non-built properties, from rents and every service of construction lease not included in the CIT or IBAPP income, and those from property made freely available to a third party without any legally mandate are subject to a property income tax at 10%.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
Mauritanian tax residents are taxable on their worldwide income. However, foreign income will not be taxable in Mauritania if the taxpayer can prove that such income has been taxed in another country.
Non-residents are only taxed on their Mauritanian-source income.
## Personal income tax rates
The following are the progressive tax rates for employment income and pensions.
| Taxable remuneration (MRU) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| From 6,000 to 9,000 | 15 |
| Between 9,000 and 21,000 | 25 |
| Exceeding 21,000 | 40 |
## Other income taxes
### Withholding tax (WHT) on remuneration paid for services rendered by a resident
Mauritanian services debtors must withhold 2.5% on remuneration paid to individuals who are resident. This WHT is only applicable when the service is provided by an individual liable for tax under the personal business income tax.
The withheld amount must be paid to the tax administration by the 15th day of the following month.
### WHT on remuneration paid for services rendered by foreign single providers or foreign companies
### WHT on rent for real estate
Rents paid to individuals are subject to a 18% WHT, which shall be withheld at source by the lessee.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
Companies are considered as Mauritanian residents if they have a registered fixed establishment. However, foreign companies can be deemed to have a permanent establishment (PE) in Mauritania when they meet certain conditions (*see below*).
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The 2020 GTC in force states that:
1. A PE means a fixed business through which the non-resident enterprise carries out all or part of its activity.
2. A PE includes or may include a business management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of natural resources extraction.
3. A PE may also include:
1. A construction site, an assembly, or an installation project, but only if this construction site or this project lasts more than 12 months for subcontractors and other petroleum operators, or 6 months for others.
2. The provision, by a non-resident company, of services, including advisory services, through employees or other workers engaged by the company for this matter, but only if these activities continue (for the same project or a related project) in Mauritania for a period exceeding 12 months for subcontractors and other petroleum operators, or 6 months for others.
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 of this article, the following does not constitute a PE in Mauritania:
1. The use of facilities for the storage or display of goods or merchandise belonging to the company.
2. The exploitation of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the company for the sole purpose of storage or display.
3. The exploitation of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the company for the sole purpose of transformation by another company.
4. The operation of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or gathering information for the business.
5. The operation of a fixed business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the company, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
6. The operation of a fixed business solely for the purpose of the cumulative exercise of the activities mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed business resulting from this accumulation retains a preparatory or auxiliary character.
7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, when a person, other than an agent enjoying an independent status to which paragraph 7 of this article applies, acts on behalf of non-resident company, this company is considered to have a PE in Mauritania for all the activities that this person undertakes for the company if this person:
1. has powers in Mauritania that it usually exercises there, enabling it to conclude contracts on behalf of the non-resident company, unless the activities of that person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 of this article and which, if they were exercised through the intermediary of a fixed business, would not make it possible to consider this business as a PE according to the provisions of this paragraph, or
2. does not have such powers but usually operates in Mauritania a stock of goods or merchandise on behalf of the non-resident company.
9. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this article, a non-resident insurance company is, except in the case of reinsurance, considered as having a PE in Mauritania if it collects premiums there or if it insures there against risks by the intermediary of a person other than an agent enjoying with an independent status to which paragraph 7 of this article applies.
10. A non-resident company is not considered to have a PE in Mauritania simply because it carries on business there through a broker, a general commission agent, or any other agent enjoying independent status, provided that these persons act in the ordinary course of their business. However, when one acts wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise and between that enterprise and the agent are established or imposed, in their commercial and financial relations, conditions that differ from those that would have been established between independent companies, this agent is not considered to be an agent enjoying an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph.
11. The fact that a Mauritania resident company controls or is controlled by a non-resident company is not in itself sufficient to make any of these companies a PE of the other.

## Fines and penalties
The amounts of transactions, fines, confiscations, penalties, and surcharges of any kind imposed on offenders in contravention of tax, customs, and social legislation, price, circulation, or consumption regulations, and, in general, the laws and regulations of the state shall not be deducted from the profits subject to tax.
## Taxes
Taxes payable by the company during the fiscal year, with the exception of CIT, are deductible.
If relief is subsequently granted on deductible taxes, the amount of such relief is included in the income for the financial year in which the company is notified of such relief.
## Net operating losses
The deficit recognised in a fiscal year is considered as a charge against taxable income in the following fiscal year.
If there is no profit, or if there is insufficient profit to allow the deduction to be made in whole or in part, the deficit or the remaining deficit may be deducted from taxable profits of the following accounting periods until the fifth period following the period in which the deficit occurred.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are subject to 15% WHT if they correspond to services provided. The management fees payments can be deducted up to a maximum of 2% of the turnover.

## Transfer pricing regime
To establish the payable CIT by companies that are dependent upon or control companies located in Mauritania or outside Mauritania, profits indirectly transferred to the latter, whether by increasing or decreasing the purchase or selling prices or by any other means, shall be included in the profit shown in the accounting. The profits indirectly transferred shall be determined by comparison with the profits that would have been realised in an arm's-length or controlling relationship.
The condition of dependence or control laid down shall not be required where the transfer is made with undertakings established in a foreign state or outside Mauritania that enjoy preferential tax treatment within the meaning of Article 23.
Ties of dependence or control shall be deemed to exist between two undertakings:
1. when one holds directly or through an intermediary the majority of the share capital of the other or actually exercises the power of decision thereat, or
2. when they are both, under the conditions set out in (a), under the control of the same undertaking or person.
When the documentation provided for in Article 66 is not produced, or is only partly produced, the tax bases concerned by the formal notice provided for in paragraph 3 of that Article shall be assessed by the administration on the basis of the information available.

There is no tax-specific treatment regarding branch income carried on in Mauritania. Except as provided by duly ratified tax treaties, the branch and the company are subject to the same tax regimes.
Profits realised in Mauritania by branches of foreign companies are deemed to be distributed and are subject to a branch withholding tax (WHT) of 10% on after-tax income.

## Foreign tax relief
Foreign taxes paid may be deducted as an expense from taxable income.
The specific process to enforce foreign tax credits either in Mauritania or abroad (depending on the payments directions) is stipulated within the specific DTT with the relevant country. Nonetheless, as far Mauritania is concerned, the practice consisting of enforcing foreign tax credits locally is very rare.
## Tax treaties
Mauritania has entered into DTTs with France, Senegal, and states of the Arab Maghreb Union (Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia).
The treaties generally provide the following relief:

The following types of income are exempt from tax:
The following types of pensions are exempt from tax:
## Equity compensation
The GTC does not provide specific rules applicable to the taxation of employer-provided stock options.

For the tax regimes based on the actual income (normal and intermediary regimes), the tax due will correspond to 30% of the tax base or to 2.5% of the taxable revenues, whichever is higher

It will be possible for the individuals subject to the intermediary tax regime to opt for the normal tax regime before 1 February of each year. The option becomes effective from 1 January of the year of the opting for the normal tax regime and should be applied for at least two fiscal years.
However, an individual subject to the normal tax regime cannot opt for the intermediary tax regime or for the lump-sum tax regime.
Taxpayers subject to the lump-sum tax regime will be liable to pay a tax of 3% of their annual turnover.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 18 July 2024
Mauritanian and foreign individuals are considered to be tax residents if they meet with the following:
It should be noted that any form of dwelling can be taken into account in the concept of a dwelling-house (house or apartment owned or rented; furnished room rented). However, the permanence of the dwelling is essential, which means that the person concerned makes the necessary arrangements to have the dwelling at one’s disposal at all times, on a continuous basis, and not occasionally for a stay that, given the reasons that motivated it, is necessarily linked to a short duration (pleasure trip, travel, business trip, study trip, internship in a school, etc.).
The centre of vital interests corresponds to the closest personal and economic ties.
This definition of tax domicile in terms of wages and salaries cannot prevail, where applicable, over a definition provided for in an applicable international convention related to a double taxation treaty (DTT).
