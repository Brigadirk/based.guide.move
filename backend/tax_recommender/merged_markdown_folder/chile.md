## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Dividends paid to a non-resident recipient are subject to a 35% withholding of ‘additional’ tax, with the FCT paid at the corporate level being totally or partially creditable against this WHT, depending on the income tax system to which the source entity is subject to. This credit is added to the amount that is distributed to form the taxable base for Additional WHT. Consequently, the tax burden for a non-resident recipient of dividends, including taxes at the company level, is 35% if subject to the SME regime or resident in a DTT country and 44.45% in case it is subject to PIS and it is not resident in a DTT country.
If the entity is subject to the SME regime, the foreign recipient of the dividends will be able to credit 100% of the FCT paid at the entity level. If the entity is subject to the PIS and the foreign recipient of the dividends is resident in a country with which Chile has a DTT in force, the foreign taxpayer will be able to credit 100% of the FCT paid at the entity level against its Additional WHT. Consequently, their total Chilean tax burden will be 35%.
Branches are subject to a 35% WHT rate on amounts remitted or withdrawn, less the FCT credit. *See the*[*Branch income*](chile/corporate/branch-income.html)*section for more information*.
Interest paid to non-residents is subject to WHT at a general 35% rate. Interest on loans granted by foreign banks or financial institutions is subject to a sole 4% WHT. Thin capitalisation rules requesting a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio become applicable when the debt generating interest subject to the lower than 35% rate is secured by related entities.
Royalties paid to non-residents are subject to the WHT at a 30% rate. Royalty payments in connection to software are subject to Additional WHT at a 15% rate, unless the software is non-customised or standard, in which case it is exempted. Such rate is increased in case the beneficiary of the payment is resident in a tax haven. The Productivity Law eliminated the rate increase in case software-related payments were made to related parties.
## Tax treaties
The following table shows the higher and lower rates of WHT applicable by Chile and the countries with which DTTs exist. The application of one or the other rate will depend on the specific provisions of each treaty.
Please note that at the end of 2023 the DTT between Chile and the United States was finally approved after years of processing and entered into force on 19 December 2023.
As for the effective dates, with respect to taxes withheld at source, the treaty is effective for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month following the date of entry into force, thus effective on 1 February 2024. With respect to other taxes, the treaty is effective for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year immediately following the date of entry into force, i.e. 1 January 2024. Information exchange provisions are effective from the date of entry into force.
Among other matters, the DTT will reduce the WHT rates on dividends, interest, and royalties paid from the United States to Chile, and vice versa.
Please note that Chile has in all its DTTs the so-called ‘Chilean Clause’, pursuant to which, Chile does not grant any remedy regarding WHT on dividends as long as the corporate tax can be fully creditable against the WHT on dividends. Consequently, WHT rules on dividends are fully applicable in DTT scenarios.

36. The DTT between Chile and the United States generally permits taxation of interest at a 10% rate (15% for the first five years after the interest provisions enter into force), except that a 4% rate will apply in certain cases. The 4% rate does not apply to ‘back-to-back’ loans.
37. According to the DTT between Chile and the United States, royalties may be taxed at a 2% rate for payments made as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment. The rate is 10% for payments made as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, scientific, or other work (including computer software, cinematographic films, audio or video tapes or disks, and other means of image or sound reproduction), any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like intangible property, or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
38. 10% as a general rule. 2% is applicable for the use of, or the right to use, some equipment.
Please note that notwithstanding most DTTs provide that interest paid to a bank or financial institution will be subject to a 5% or 10% WHT, as Chile applies a 4% Additional WHT rate to interest paid to foreign banks or financial institutions, the local tax rate is applied instead of the treaty rate, as local law is more favourable.
Please also note that an Exchange of Information Convention with Bermuda, Guernsey, Jersey, and Uruguay, as well as a Multilateral Convention, is in force.

# Chile
## Overview
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Chile, a long and narrow country between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes mountains in South America, is bordered by Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, and Argentina to the east. Chile is divided into 15 regions. Regions are divided into provinces, and provinces are divided into municipalities administered by elected mayors. The capital of Chile is Santiago. The official language of Chile is Spanish, and the currency is the Chilean peso (CLP).
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule. Although Chile declared its independence in 1810, victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates, and have helped secure the country's commitment to a democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation. Chile has a market-oriented economy characterised by a high level of foreign trade and a reputation for strong financial institutions and sound policy that have given it the strongest sovereign bond rating in South America. Exports account for more than one-fourth of gross domestic product (GDP), with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports. Over the last several years, Chile has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with the European Union (EU), South Korea, China, and Japan, among other countries.
The Chilean government conducts a rule-based countercyclical fiscal policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth and allowing deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth. In May 2010, Chile became a full member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) after a two-year period of compliance with the organisation’s mandates.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
As a general rule, for purposes of the FCT, corporate income is determined on an accrual basis.
## Inventory valuation
Inventories must be valued in accordance with monetary correction provisions, basically by adjusting raw material content and direct labour to replacement cost (which is generally the most recent cost) but excluding indirect costs. No conformity is required between book and tax reporting for income determination. Last in first out (LIFO) is not allowed for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to normal taxation unless special provisions, such as those pertaining to gains on the sale of shares/quotas or monetary correction on capital repayments, establish exemptions.
Under domestic laws, in certain circumstances, the capital gains derived from the following securities will be subject to a preferential tax treatment:
Note that, due to indirect sales provisions, capital gains arising from the sale of foreign companies holding Chilean assets may be subject to Chilean taxation if certain requirements are met.
### Shares or quotas capital gains
As a general rule, capital gains derived from the alienation of shares or quotas from Chilean entities are subject to the general tax regime.
### Real estate (property) alienation
#### Real estate (property) acquired before 1 January 2004 and sold after 1 January 2017
In the case of real estate (property) acquired before 1 January 2004 and sold after 1 January 2017, the capital gain exemption upon the alienation of real estate will apply without limitations.
#### Real estate (property) alienation general rule
Capital gains obtained upon the alienation of real estate (property) will be considered as non-taxable income as long as the following joint requirements are met: (i) the seller should be a final taxpayer; (ii) the acquirer must not be a related entity; (iii) more than one year must have elapsed between the acquisition date and the alienation date or four years in case of alienation of buildings per floors or apartments or in case of land subdivision; and (iv) the total capital gains obtained by the taxpayer upon the alienation of real estates, during its whole life, should not exceed 8,000 *unidades de fomento* (UF, which is a determined amount of Chilean pesos duly adjusted for inflation on a daily basis), regardless of the number of real estates owned by the taxpayer and the transfers performed.
If the requirements mentioned in (i), (ii), and (iii) above are not met, the total capital gain will be subject to the general taxation regime. If the above requirements are met, but the capital gain exceeds UF 8,000, the excess will be subject to: (i) surtax as a sole tax, on an accrued or cash basis, with the option of reassessment within ten years, or (ii) 10% sole and replacement tax, applied on a cash basis.
## Dividend income
As a general rule, dividends received by Chilean entities from other Chilean entities that have already been subject to FCT are not subject to the FCT again at an entity level. However, when these dividends are distributed (depending on the applicable income tax system) up-stream and the ownership chain reaches the final Chilean owners or the foreign owners, they will be taxed with the Global Complementary Tax or the Additional WHT, respectively.
## Interest income
No specific provision exists in Chile for interest income; consequently, interest income is subject to FCT.
## Royalty income
Royalties paid to a Chilean entity are subject to the general income taxation; consequently, royalty income is subject to FCT.
## Foreign income
Resident entities are subject to taxes on their worldwide income. In general terms, foreign income and dividends received by a domestic entity are subject to Chilean taxation in the commercial year when they are received (i.e. on a cash basis); however, certain foreign income needs to be recognised on an accrued basis (i.e. income from foreign PEs and passive income from CFCs). A tax credit for taxes paid abroad is granted, subject to the regulations of the Income Tax Law.
Branches of foreign corporations are taxed on their income without regard to the results of the head office.

## Social security contributions
Foreign individuals may be exempt from some local social security payments, provided they belong to a foreign social security entity system covering at least pension, disability, illness, and death. If not exempt, salaries are subject to Chilean social security contribution of 20%, computed on the monthly salary capped at 75.7 *unidades de fomento* (UF, which is a determined amount of Chilean pesos duly adjusted for inflation on a daily basis), which is approximately USD 3,048.65 per month, deductible for tax purposes as well.
Additionally, there are necessary contributions, not covered by the exemption mentioned above, of 3% in connection with unemployment insurance (0.6% contributed by the employee and 2.4% contributed by the employer) with a cap of UF 113.5 (approximately USD 4,570.96) and insurance that covers labour accidents and professional illness. The latter amount payable is calculated by taking into consideration the activities developed by the company and the duties of the employees.
In practice, non-residents normally are not subject to social security contributions in Chile.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Chile.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## First Category Tax (FCT)
The basic tax on income of a legal entity domiciled or resident in Chile and engaged in commerce, mining, fishing, or industrial activities is the FCT, which is assessed at a 25% rate for SMEs and 27% rate for entities subject to the partially integrated system (PIS) on the entity's worldwide income.
Final taxation (i.e. at the Chilean final owner's level or at the foreign owner's level) is triggered on a cash basis.
FCT is totally creditable against final tax in the SME regime but only partially in the PIS (only 65% is creditable). However, foreign owners of a PIS entity that are resident in a DTT jurisdiction are entitled to full credit as well.
### FCT reduction for SMEs
Due to the global pandemic, the Chilean government developed an Emergency Plan for Economic and Employment Reactivation.
One of the most relevant measures adopted was to establish a temporary reduction of the FCT for SMEs.
In this way, those taxpayers who are covered by the SME regime established in Article 14 Letter D of the Income Tax Law (micro, small, and medium-sized companies) will pay a reduced FCT for the 2020, 2021, and 2022 business years.
Thus, the government, through a new law, established a temporarily reduction of the rate of this tax from 25% to 10% during three business years, subject to measures to focus the incentive and prevent misuse.
Likewise, the taxpayers who benefit from this reduction will have their monthly provisional payment (PPM) rate that corresponds to them paid in fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022 halved. This reduction in PPMs will apply with respect to the filing and payment that must be made in the following month from the publication of the law in the Official Gazette.
## Income taxation systems in force
The attribution regime of taxation is repealed as of 2020.
A full integration regime is introduced for SMEs (i.e. with sales not exceeding approximately USD 2.8 million annually) so that the corporate level tax should be fully creditable against final taxes.
For large enterprises, the current PIS regime of taxation is applicable (i.e. 27% CIT rate and shareholder’s taxation on a cash basis with full or partial CIT credit depending on whether the non-resident shareholder is resident or not in countries with which Chile has a DTT in force).
Please note that non-resident shareholders in jurisdictions that have signed a DTT with Chile prior to 1 January 2020 that are not yet in force (currently the United Arab Emirates) are entitled to full tax credit for FCT paid until 31 December 2026.
Taxpayers will need to keep a registry regarding the 'accumulated tax credit balance' in order to control the available FCT credit.
## Local income taxes
Chilean legislation does not establish any provincial or local income taxes.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is payable on the transfer of goods and the provision of services at a 19% rate. In general terms, this tax is levied over the price of the following goods and services:
The sale of fixed assets is subject to VAT, provided that the taxpayer was entitled to VAT credit for its acquisition, importation, or construction.
VAT works on a credit-debit system. The tax borne by a company or business in the acquisition of goods or services is called the ‘VAT credit’. The VAT charged on the goods and services sold to customers is called the ‘VAT debit’. As a general rule, the seller or service provider is obligated to withhold and pay the VAT. The tax amount is added to the invoice; consequently, the final consumer economically bears the VAT.
Exceptionally, when a seller or service provider is not domiciled in Chile or when, for other reasons, the Chilean SII has difficulties assessing the correct payment of VAT, the responsibility to withhold and pay the tax is transferred to the buyer or beneficiary of the service.
The tax is paid every month by deducting the VAT credit from the VAT debit. The balance due (when the debit is greater than the credit) must be paid within the first 12 days of the month following the month in which the transaction took place.
If, in a given month, the VAT credit is greater than the VAT debit, the balance may be kept and carried forward to the following months.
Law No. 20,727 gradually establishes the compulsory use of electronic invoices and other tax documents, such as credit and debit notes, purchase invoices, etc. As of 1 February 2017, all taxpayers should be subject to it.
There are qualified exceptions to this electronic regime, such as zones where there is no public electricity, zones declared as a disaster area, and other exceptions authorised by the Chilean SII.
Law No. 20,727 also established the express acknowledgement of the invoice receipt as an enabling requirement in order to use the fiscal credit.
Additionally, leasing agreements by a habitual seller are a taxable event. Notwithstanding that the above are exempted when the acquisition of the real estate property subject of the relevant leasing was not taxed with VAT and the aforementioned acquisition was performed to enter into the leasing agreement.
Digital services are also covered by VAT at a 19% rate as of June 2020.
Law No. 21,713 modified several provisions regarding the application of VAT:
### VAT on the acquisition of goods abroad
In general terms, the existing regime for digital services also applies to sales of goods located abroad (and to remote services in general). Therefore:
### VAT on fixed assets
The SII may assess and collect VAT on movable and immovable tangible assets that form part of the immobilised assets, carried out by the company that creates or subsists on the occasion of a business reorganisation, when the main purpose of this has been to avoid the payment of the tax.
### Authority to assess VAT
The possibility is introduced for a taxpayer to request the assessment of the VAT to be paid when they provide evidence that they are unable to determine it themselves. In this regard, the procedure for assessing the taxable base is restricted by incorporating into Article 20 of the law (applicable when the taxpayer is unable to determine the tax to be paid) the stipulation that when sales determined by the SII do not exceed UF 2,400.
### Export VAT
Exporters who cease their activities are required to demonstrate that they have exported, in the last 36 months, an amount equivalent to the refunded tax, in accordance with Article 36 of the VAT Law. If they do not comply, they must return the proportional part of the refund, unless they are in bankruptcy liquidation.
Additionally, if an exporter with an advance refund is absorbed by another company during a reorganisation, the new company will retain the rights and obligations of the refund without the need to return what has already been refunded, if the original project continues.
## Customs duties
As a general rule, the customs duty rate is 6%. However, as Chile has an extended network of free trade agreements (FTAs), reduced or zero-rate customs duties are available.
Duties on goods are imposed on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price, without deducting special discounts.
In general, Chile has a very open economy, and there are no significant barriers to foreign trade.
## Excise taxes
Alcoholic beverages, certain non-alcoholic beverages (e.g. beverages high in sugar levels, hypertonic beverages), tobacco, and certain luxury items (e.g. jewels) are subject to an additional sales tax ranging from 10% to 50%.
A variable gasoline tax is also levied on the difference between a fixed amount and the sales price of gasoline and diesel oil.
'Green taxes' are taxes that are levied on the issuance of certain pollutants by some non-eco-friendly assets, such as boilers or turbines. A corrective tax is also established on the issuance of certain local pollutants connected to vehicles' performance.
## Real Estate Tax
Real Estate Tax is levied over an official valuation of real estate at an annual rate of 1.4% in case of non-farming real estate and 1% for farming real estate. Some real estate is exempt from this tax.
A surcharge is progressively applicable to the immovable properties that a taxpayer has with a total fiscal value that exceeds approximately USD 530,000.
## Transfer taxes
Currently, Chilean law has not established any transfer taxes.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is levied mainly on documents that evidence money lending operations, and its rate varies depending on the executed document.
For documents subject to a specific date, stamp tax applies at 0.066% per month or fraction of a month. The maximum stamp tax rate is 0.8%. For documents payable on demand or without an expiration date, the tax rate is 0.332%.
## Payroll taxes
The income that the employer pays to the employee that provides personal services in a subordinate and dependent relationship under an employment contract is subject to payroll tax.
Payroll tax is characterised as a single tax that is based on a progressive scale of rates, ranging from 0% to 40%, applicable to income brackets. Only the income or remuneration received is subject to this tax. Whoever pays the taxable income must deduct and withhold the tax on a monthly basis.
## Social security contributions
Pursuant to Chilean legislation, affiliation to the Chilean social security system is mandatory from the moment that any individual starts rendering services due to an employment contract.
In order to contribute to the Chilean social security scheme, the assignee needs to be incorporated into the Chilean pension fund (AFP), the Chilean health insurance (private health insurance [ISAPRE] or public health insurance [FONASA]), death and disability insurance, work related accidents and professional illness insurance, and unemployment insurance.
An employer’s obligation for social security is low, as it only assumes part of the unemployment insurance (2.4% calculated over the worker’s gross salary). Whilst the employee assumes most of the social security contribution (approximately 20% of gross salary).

## Social security contributions
Foreign individuals may be exempt from some local social security payments, provided they belong to a foreign social security entity system covering at least pension, disability, illness, and death. If not exempt, salaries are subject to Chilean social security contribution of 20%, computed on the monthly salary capped at 75.7 *unidades de fomento* (UF, which is a determined amount of Chilean pesos duly adjusted for inflation on a daily basis), which is approximately USD 3,048.65 per month, deductible for tax purposes as well.
Additionally, there are necessary contributions, not covered by the exemption mentioned above, of 3% in connection with unemployment insurance (0.6% contributed by the employee and 2.4% contributed by the employer) with a cap of UF 113.5 (approximately USD 4,570.96) and insurance that covers labour accidents and professional illness. The latter amount payable is calculated by taking into consideration the activities developed by the company and the duties of the employees.
In practice, non-residents normally are not subject to social security contributions in Chile.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Chile.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year coincides with the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The tax system is one of self-assessment by the taxpayer, with occasional auditing by the tax authorities. Annual tax returns must be filed with the SII before 30 April of each year with respect to the operations of the previous calendar year.
Note that there are many other sworn statements with different deadlines, from March until June of each year.
## Payment of tax
Taxes are payable when the annual tax return is submitted in April of each year. Taxpayers, in general, are subject to monthly advance payments on account of their annual income taxes. The difference between the advance payments and the final tax bill is payable in cash at the time the tax return is filed. If prepayments exceed the final tax bill, the excess is reimbursed by the Treasury.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the Chilean tax system is based on self-assessment; however, many large businesses are under continuous audit by the SII. Businesses and individuals are also generally subject to audit on a random basis.
## Tax anonymous informant
Law No. 21,713 introduced the figure of the anonymous informant, guaranteeing the confidentiality of their identity and establishing the standards to be considered as such, including penalties (including criminal charges) for false or malicious reports. If the report is effective and successful, the informant may receive 10% of the fine applied to the respective offender.
It is established that the status of anonymous informant will be lost if anonymity is waived or if the report is publicised.
To access the financial reward, which amounts to 10% of the defrauded taxes, the amount of the offence must exceed UTA 100.
## Statute of limitations
As a general rule, the statute of limitations is three years. However, it can be extended to six years if no tax return was filed or if the tax return was maliciously false.
Currently the tax authority is focuses on tax compliance. Specifically, with the implementation of the amendments made by Law No. 21,713 of 2024, the SII was provided with new tools to combat informality, tax evasion, avoidance, and organised crime.
## Self-reporting of tax discrepancies
According to Law No. 21,713, taxpayers are given the option to self-report discrepancies in taxes that may constitute tax crimes, along with the requirements for doing so:
In these cases, the taxpayer will not be subject to a complaint or legal action, and such discrepancies will not be eligible for forgiveness of interest and penalties. However, they may enter into a payment agreement with the Treasury Service.
## General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) provisions
Law No. 21,713 modify several articles of the Tax Code, ensuring that the GAAR will undergo both clarity and coherence adjustments, as well as substantive changes. The following are the main changes:
Finally, an increase in penalties is implemented for cases where fees exceeding 100 Monthly Tax Units (UTM) are agreed upon, with a maximum cap of UTM 250, as stipulated by the rule.

## Local income taxes
There are no local income taxes to be paid in Chile, only central government taxes.

## Tax returns
Yearly tax returns need not be filed if the employee receives only salary income paid from one employer. If taxable income from another source is received, such as interest income, and/or if the individual wants to claim certain tax benefits, a yearly tax return should be filed.
## Payment of tax
In case of employees, there is a mandatory monthly withholding by the employer, as long as the compensation is paid by a local employer. If the compensation is not paid by a local company, the employee has the personal liability to declare, withhold, and pay the monthly tax.

## Chilean Congress approves Modernisation Tax Bill
On 29 January 2020, the Chilean Congress approved the so-called 'Modernisation Tax Bill' after a year and a half of discussion. The original bill went through substantial amendments both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, incorporating the amendments agreed to in December 2019 in the so-called 'Tax Agreement' between the Senate’s Finance Commission and the Government, to finance the new social agenda. Chile published Law No. 21,210 on the modernisation of tax legislation in the Official Gazette on 24 February 2020.
## Integration of corporate tax and final taxes
The attribution regime of taxation was repealed.
A full integration regime is introduced for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (i.e. with sales not exceeding approximately 2.8 million United States dollars [USD] annually) so that the corporate level tax should be fully creditable against final taxes.
For large enterprises, the current partially integrated system (PIS) of taxation is applicable (i.e. 27% corporate income tax [CIT] rate and shareholder’s taxation on a cash basis with full or partial CIT credit depending on whether the non-resident shareholders is resident or not in countries with which Chile has a double tax treaty [DTT] in force).
For non-resident shareholders who are resident in a tax treaty jurisdiction and beneficiaries of dividend income under the respective tax treaty, the overall taxation under the PIS regime should be capped to 35%, the latter being their total Chilean tax burden.
## Expenses
## Progressive repeal of tax refunds of Payments per Absorbed Profits (PPUA)
The PPUA is repealed as of commercial year 2024 onwards (i.e. the tax refunds received by companies whose losses have absorbed the profits received from their subsidiaries, which in turn have been subject to CIT, regarding withdrawals and dividends received as of that year).
The repeal will not affect the allocation of losses to the companies’ own present or future profits, nor the use of the CIT credit against final taxes, which will be controlled in the tax credit balance ledger (SAC by its acronym in Spanish) of the receiving entity.
Between years 2020 and 2023, the PPUA refund will be reduced gradually as follows: 90% in commercial year 2020, 80% in commercial year 2021, 70% in commercial year 2022, and 50% in commercial year 2023.
## Private Investment Funds (FIP) and Investment Funds.
Article 92 from Law No. 20,712 is amended by introducing new incorporation requirements for FIPs (e.g. non-related parties not being able to hold a 20% ownership interest in the fund each; the 20% ownership limitation considers any related party’s interest).
In addition, the amendment states that if, after a year since this Law enters into force, the FIPs do not meet the requirements stated in the proposed provision, the fund would be considered as a corporation for tax purposes during the commercial year in which the FIP failed to comply with the new requirements.
However, the amendment states that if the FIP subsequently complies with the new requirements, it shall be considered again as a fund for tax purposes, for the income obtained from 1 January of the following commercial year to the one that meets the requirements.
## International rules
In addition, a new concept and requirements to qualify as a foreign or international financial institution (FFI) are incorporated.
## Value-added tax (VAT) on digital services
A new taxable event is incorporated in Article 8 letter (n) of the VAT Law (D.L. 825) in order to tax with VAT the services provided by digital platforms and other tech companies.
## Regional development contribution of 1%
A special contribution of 1% over the acquisition value of all fixed assets of one same investment industrial project is incorporated. Requirements for the project are the following:
The tax will be applied to the acquisition value of all physical assets of the fixed assets, but only in the part that exceeds the amount of USD 10 million.
## Law No. 21,420 - Reduces or eliminates tax exemptions
In February 2022, the Chilean government approved Law No. 21,420, which, in order to finance a new pension law, contains a series of eliminations and modifications to existing tax exemptions in different regulations. Among the most relevant, the following stand out:
### Actively traded exemption - Stocks listed in the Chilean stock exchange
#### 10% single tax rate on capital gains
Article 107 of the ITL, which states that the gains obtained from the disposal of certain instruments on the stock market (actively traded stocks listed in the Chilean stock exchange) will be considered as non-taxable gains and will not be subject to taxes, has been modified. Now, the capital gain obtained from the transfer of securities that have a stock market presence will be taxed with a single tax rate of 10%.
This tax will apply to all transfers taking place after six months from the first day of the month following the date the law is effective (i.e. when published in Chilean Official Gazette).
The gain subject to the 10% single tax will be determined by the difference between the sale price and (i) the official closing price of the security as of 31 December of the year of its acquisition or (ii) the tax basis (i.e. acquisition cost determined following Chilean general principles).
This tax will not affect institutional investors, whether they are residents or domiciled in Chile or abroad.
### Exemptions related to the real estate market
#### VAT credit in construction repeal
Under the current rules, construction companies have the right to deduct from the amount of their monthly provisional payments (CIT advanced payments) 65% of the VAT debit they must determine on the sale of real estate for housing. Properties the value of which does not exceed 2,000 *unidades de fomento* (UF, which is a determined amount of Chilean pesos duly adjusted for inflation on a daily basis) (approximately USD 76,272) are benefited, with a cap of up to UF 225 (approximately USD 8,580) per house. The same benefit applies to VAT-exempt sales of properties acquired by beneficiaries of housing subsidies. In this case, the benefit is equivalent to 12.35% of the transfer value.
With the approval of the Law No. 21,420, this special credit is eliminated for real estate construction contracts signed and sales performed from 1 January 2025, and it gradually reduces the amount to be deducted from the CIT monthly provisional payments to 32.5% of the VAT debit and 6.175% of the value of the sale, respectively, with respect to sales performed and real estate construction agreements entered into from 1 January 2023.
#### Repeal of rental income tax exemption
This new law limits the benefits only to individuals having a maximum of two real estate as of 1 January 2023, regardless of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the DFL2 rental income regime is restricted to scenario where the aforementioned requirements are met.
### Provision of services subject to VAT
Under the current VAT provisions, services are subject to Chilean VAT to the extent they fall within the activities listed in Article 20 No. 3 and 4 of the Chilean ITL (e.g. commercial and industrial activities, extractive activities, advertisement). Professional and technical assistance services are generally not subject to Chilean VAT, as they do not fall within the mentioned.
Law No. 21,420 repeals the reference to Article 20 of Chilean ITL, thus all services should be subject to Chilean VAT, unless they are expressly exempted. This implies a radical change in the concept of services levied with Chilean VAT. The VAT on services will apply to services provided from 1 January 2023 onwards. However, the exemption for services provided by individuals (e.g. professional services) is maintained, whether they are provided independently or by virtue of an employment contract.
In addition, health services are expressly VAT exempt, excluding laboratory services. Note that this law maintains the VAT exemptions that currently exist for various services classified as meritorious (e.g. education and passenger transport). Therefore, in general, the exemptions contemplated in Articles 12 and 13 of the VAT Law are not greatly modified. A last novelty in this regard is that the bill maintains as not subject to VAT the remuneration obtained by 'professional associations' referred to in Article 42 No. 2 of the ITL, even when they have chosen to declare their income according to the first category regulations.
### Repeal of inheritance tax benefit related to life insurance
Under the current rules, amounts received by beneficiaries derived from life insurance contracts are considered as non-taxable income and not subject to inheritance and gifts tax.
Through the recently approved law, the inheritance tax exemption is repealed for amounts derived from life insurance contracts celebrated after the entry into force of the law, except for the disability and survival insurance of Decree Law No. 3,500, of 1980.
### Increase in the land tax surcharge
The Tax Modernization Law (Law No. 21,210) incorporated a new land tax surcharge, applicable to the fiscal assessment of real estate that, as a whole, exceeds 670 Annual Tax Units (UTA), which is about 400 million Chilean pesos (CLP) (approximately USD 483,170). This surcharge is applied in steps ranging from 0.075% to 0.275%.
### Modernisation of mining concessions
Today in Chile, mining concessions (the right granted by the Chilean state to mine) are protected by a licences system ('patentes mineras'), and the right to explore and/or exploit is granted based on an annual patent payment. Thus, in Chile there are two types of mining concessions:
Specifically, as a first measure, Law No. 21,420 increases the duration of the exploration licence to four years but eliminates the possibility of renewal. Additionally, the amount of the licence would be increased from 1/50 UTM to 3/50 UTM per hectare.
On the other hand, with respect to the exploitation licence, its indefinite duration is maintained. The value of the licences already granted is maintained only for those patents that demonstrate effective work, but the value of the non-metallic licence is increased to the level of the metallic one (1/10 UTM).
Finally, another modification is on the values of the exploitation licences. In this context, it is intended to create a progressive scale over the years for concessions that do not prove their work (regardless of whether it is metallic/non-metallic), starting at 4/10 UTM per hectare for the first five years, up to 12 UTM per hectare for licences from year 31.
### Decrease in credit for purchases of fixed assets
As of today, those taxpayers who declare effective income through full accounting are entitled to a credit equivalent to 6% of the value of the fixed asset, acquired new or completed during the year. This percentage can decrease up to 4% depending on the company's sales level and in no case can it exceed 500 UTM (approximately USD 18,130,00). As a last financing measure, this credit is eliminated as of 1 January 2023 for those companies with average annual sales of over 100,000 UF (large companies) (approximately USD 3,780,000). Therefore, the exemption that benefits taxpayers in relation to the physical fixed assets, which mainly belong to the large company sector, is eliminated.
### Treatment of leasing contracts
Until December 2022, the tax treatment of leasing differs from its financial treatment. For financial purposes, it is recognised as the existence of financing for the acquisition of an asset; however, from a tax perspective it is treated as a ’lease‘ with the option to buy. This implies that financially the acquirer of the asset becomes its owner and applies depreciation provisions; however, for tax purposes it is considered an expense.
The already mentioned Law No. 21,420 tried to modify this by incorporating a new article 37 bis in the Income Tax Law. With this new article, this divergence would end, and the tax treatment of leasing would be equivalent to its financial treatment since it recognises the economic reality of the operation. The new treatment operates for those contracts entered into as of 1 January 2023.
On 15 February 2023, Law No. 21,540 was published in the Official Gazette, proceeding to repeal and eliminate the aforementioned article 37 bis.
In this regard, Law No. 21,540 does not establish a special validity, so it should be considered effective as of 1 January of the year following its publication, and taxes that must be paid as of that date will be subject to the new Law.
In other words, regarding this matter, everything remains the same as it was on 31 December 2022.
### Minimum wage
Law No. 21,578, published in the Official Gazette on 30 May 2023, regulated, among other measures, two quite important aspects.
In the first place, with the approval of the law, the minimum wage in Chile is increased, leaving the amounts that will rise gradually as follows:
The law contemplates the possibility of increasing the minimum wage according to the variation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Therefore, in the event that the accumulated CPI during 2023 exceeds 6%, an increase of CLP 10,000 will be made on 1 January 2024, leaving the minimum wage at CLP 470,000 on that date.
In addition, the law contemplates an automatic readjustment of the monthly minimum wage on 1 January 2025, according to the CPI percentage between the months of July and December 2024.
In addition, this law reached an agreement that consists of a subsidy of amounts for each of the periods of increase in the minimum wage, which varies according to the size of the company (micro, small, and medium), in order to provide greater coverage and protection to microenterprises.
The main measure was to modify Law No. 21,256 in order to extend the current benefit of the 10% First Category Tax (FCT) rate for companies in the SME regime and establish the rate at 12.5% during 2024, postponing the increase to 25% for the year 2025.
## The Tax Compliance Obligation Bill - Law 21,713
On 24 October 2024, Law No. 21,713 was published in the Official Gazette. This law establishes regulations to ensure compliance with tax obligations within the framework of the Pact for Economic Growth, Social Progress, and Fiscal Responsibility.
This law amends various legal frameworks with the aim of strengthening control and oversight mechanisms for tax collection by the National Customs Service (SNA) and the Internal Revenue Service (SII).
It also includes tax regulation changes aimed at curbing non-compliance and reducing tax evasion. These measures include adjustments to the GAAR, enhanced oversight of business groups, VAT on the purchase of imported goods through digital platforms, and reporting requirements for the number of transfers, among others.
Additionally, initiatives related to the new governance structure of the SII are introduced, including the creation of a Tax Council. The Council’s main functions will be to provide opinions on the institution’s circular letters subject to mandatory public consultation procedures and the Tax Compliance Management Plan, among other tasks. An Executive Committee is also established, composed of the Director, who will chair the committee, and the Subdirectors of Regulations, Auditing, and Legal Affairs, who will evaluate whether the SII should initiate an investigation under the anti-avoidance rule.
The Tax Compliance Law also establishes multijurisdictional procedures and a simplified judicial process for lifting bank secrecy.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Companies incorporated in Chile are considered to be Chilean residents.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE under local law includes a (i) fixed place of business PE and (ii) an agency PE (or dependent agent PE). Construction or project PE and service PE are not covered by Chilean law. Additionally, a PE is not generated under domestic law if only auxiliary and preparatory activities are being performed.
Please bear in mind that an entity may be considered as a PE under DTT terms but not under domestic law. In this case, in principle, the corresponding WHT should apply over the gross basis of the remittance.
However, Chilean SII rulings have interpreted the relation between the two different PE concepts, in the sense that, even though domestic requirements are not met, the taxpayer may choose to be treated as a local PE in order to be allowed to deduct the expenses incurred in the PE’s business.
For purposes of determining whether an entity is considered a PE, the substance-over-form principle will apply according to an administrative interpretation issued by the Chilean SII in December 2017.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
An FCT payer’s net taxable income is calculated by deducting from gross income those expenses incurred to generate it that have not already been deducted as costs.
As a general rule, expenses are not deductible for income tax purpose if they are not incurred to generate taxable income.
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation rates are calculated based on the asset’s estimated useful life. The normal depreciation terms for new assets are as follows: heavy machinery, 15 years; trucks, 7 years; factory buildings, in general, 20 years to 40 years. At the request of the Foreign Investment Committee or the taxpayer, the Chilean SII may reduce the normal useful life.
Annual depreciation is calculated based on the straight-line method. However, taxpayers may recover capitalised costs by using the accelerated depreciation method for up to one-third of the normal useful life regarding new or imported fixed assets, provided that the normal period of depreciation is at least three years.
Accelerated depreciation may be used only to reduce the taxable basis of the FCT. For the purpose of the tax applicable to distributions of dividends, accelerated depreciation is not considered.
No conformity is required between book and tax depreciation.
For tax purposes, depletion for natural mineral resources is allowed on a unit-of-production basis.
SMEs (sales capped at approximately USD 2.8 million) and companies with sales lower than approximately USD 3.8 million are entitled to faster types of depreciation methods (even instant depreciation), which they can use if certain requirements are met.
### Instantaneous depreciation
Law No. 21,210, published in February 2020, incorporated a transitory benefit of instantaneous depreciation of 50% for the investment in fixed assets between 1 June 2019 and 31 December 2021, as well as an instantaneous depreciation of 100% for investments made in the Region of La Araucanía.
Law No. 21,256 modified this legal provision, now extending the instantaneous depreciation to 100% for investments made throughout the country for fixed assets that are acquired between 1 June 2020 and 31 December 2022.
Additionally, an instantaneous amortisation regime is incorporated with respect to certain intangible assets that are acquired between 1 June 2020 and 31 December 2022 and that are protected in accordance with the law, such as industrial property, copyright, and new plant varieties, thus recognising the various forms of investment and technological development that evidence our increasingly digitised economy.
Note that the instantaneous depreciation contemplated in Law No. 21,210 continues to apply for assets acquired until May 2020.
## Goodwill
Following a merger, the positive difference between the price paid for the shares of the absorbed entity (i.e. the acquisition cost of the shares) and its tax equity must be allocated proportionately among the non-monetary assets received from the absorbed entity, up to the fair market value (FMV) of those identifiable assets.
Any amount in excess of the FMV of those assets becomes an asset (i.e. goodwill) in the hands of the acquiring/surviving company that cannot be amortised. The change introduced by the recent Tax Reform qualifies this goodwill as an ‘intangible’ asset that can be deducted only upon the liquidation or termination of the company. This renders the goodwill a non-amortisable asset for Chilean tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses must be capitalised and considered as an asset for tax purposes. However, they can be amortised over a six-year period counted from the year in which they were incurred or the start-up of commercial activities.
Furthermore, they are usually deducted when the income is generated.
## Interest expenses
As long as the interest paid meets the general requirements set forth by the Income Tax Law, interest expenses can be deducted.
## Bad debt
In general, bad debts are deductible only if (i) they are a consequence of operations related to the business purpose, (ii) they have been timely written off into the accounting records, and (iii) the company has prudentially exhausted all reasonable means to collect them.
Determination of whether the company has prudentially exhausted all reasonable means to collect the bad debts varies according to the total amount of the debts. Consequently, a simple estimation or general provision for bad debts is not allowable.
Additionally, unrelated party bad debts deduction is allowed where unpaid credits last for more than 365 days, or a percentage thereof, following the criteria defined by the Chilean SII.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions may be deducted from gross income, provided they are made to the institutions established by certain laws (i.e. primary and secondary educational institutions, universities, professional or technical education institutions, National Fire Brigade, National Solidarity Fund, etc.).
In case of charitable contributions, the total annual tax deduction for this purpose is limited, as the deductible amount may not exceed 5% of the company's net taxable income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties imposed for breaching the law or a contract might be deductible in some cases and meeting the relevant requirements. Additionally, deduction is usually available for the legal costs incurred in defending such an action.
## Taxes
Taxes imposed by Chilean laws are deductible, provided they are related to the company’s normal activities. However, income taxes and special contributions for promotion or improvement are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
An indefinite carryforward of losses is allowed. Consistent with monetary correction, losses carried forward are adjusted by a cost-of-living increase.
Carryback losses are not allowed.
The PPUA is repealed from the commercial year 2024 onwards (i.e. the tax refunds received by companies whose losses have absorbed the profits received from their subsidiaries, which in turn have been subject to CIT, regarding withdrawals and dividends received as of that year).
The repeal would not affect the allocation of losses to the companies’ own present or future profits, nor the use of the CIT credit against final taxes, which will be controlled in the tax credit balance ledger (SAC by its acronym in Spanish) of the receiving entity.
Between years 2020 and 2023 the PPUA return will be reduced gradually as follows: 90% in commercial year 2020, 80% in commercial year 2021, 70% in commercial year 2022, and 50% in commercial year 2023.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The deductibility of payments made abroad for the use of trademarks, patents, formulas, and consulting and other similar services is limited to a maximum of 4% of the income derived from sales and services in the corresponding year, unless the royalty is subject to an income tax with a rate of greater than 30% in the country of residency of the beneficiary.
Deduction of payments made to foreign-related parties are allowed in the year in which they are effectively paid by the Chilean entity to the foreign-related party and only if the corresponding Additional WHT (if any) was paid.
Transfer pricing regulations in Chile are in line with general Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles (*see the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html)*section*).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Consolidated returns are not allowed in Chile.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing legislation generally adheres to the OECD in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (OECD Guidelines). Law No. 21,713 modified several provisions regarding transfer price legislation. The principle of full competition (arm's-length) is expressly incorporated as a guiding factor in transfer pricing. In this context, the SII may question prices, values, or returns used in transactions between related parties if they have not been conducted at normal market prices, values, or returns.
### Modifications to the concept of related parties
A legal presumption of relatedness is established for transactions with parties domiciled or residing in tax havens, regardless of whether they belong to the same corporate group.
The criterion of relatedness based on natural persons (family or kinship relationships) is eliminated.
### Transfer pricing adjustments
To determine whether a transaction complies with the arm’s-length principle, the SII may establish a single figure or two or more comparable prices or profit margins. In the latter case, an interquartile range will be used, and values outside this range will be considered non-arm’s-length.
If the taxpayer accepts the SII’s adjustment and amends their annual tax return, any value within the interquartile range may be agreed upon. However, if the SII issues an assessment or resolution, only the median can be used.
It is clarified that transfer pricing adjustments will not affect taxes other than income tax.
### Amendments to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)
A voluntary preliminary stage called a 'consultation' is created, during which a preliminary administrative analysis of the agreement’s feasibility will be conducted.
The SII’s response period is extended from 6 to 12 months, and the agreement’s validity is increased from 3 to 4 years. Taxpayers must submit an annual report on compliance with the agreement.
### Self-adjustments for transfer pricing
Taxpayers are allowed to make self-adjustments to transfer pricing without the SII’s intervention if they fail to comply with the arm’s-length principle. These adjustments may only result in an increase to the taxpayer’s taxable base, do not require SII authorisation, and will solely affect income tax.
### Customs Regulations
A new provision is added to the Customs Ordinance specifying that transfer pricing adjustments or self-adjustments will not affect the values declared in import or export transactions, nor will it be necessary to modify these declared values.
## Country-by-country (CbC) report
Chile, as an OECD member, applied Action 13 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project in order to require from ‘multinational enterprises’ the filing of a report that includes, among other things, the revenues, results, and taxes of the entities of the group in their relevant jurisdictions.
Provided that the consolidated revenues of the group in the last fiscal year were at least 750 million euros (EUR), the ultimate parent company or controller entity with Chilean residence of a group of ‘multinational enterprises’ has to file an annual sworn statement by 30 June.
## Business groups
Law No. 21,713 modified certain aspects of Article 8 of the Tax Code. Among the modifications in this area, the new provisions state that:
## Thin capitalisation
The thin capitalisation rules apply to related-party loans at a 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio, and a 35% sole penalty tax is levied on interest, commissions, services, or any other financial disbursements associated to loans subject to the Additional WHT at a rate lower than 35%, or that have not been taxed under domestic law or due to the application of a reduced rate under a DTT, when the taxpayer is in an excess of indebtedness position.
The excess of indebtedness is calculated on an annual basis, and, in order to determine if the taxpayer is in an excess of indebtedness position, its total annual indebtedness takes into consideration all loans, domestic or foreign, with related parties or not.
In case the company is in an excess of indebtedness position, the tax will apply only to cross-border loans granted by related parties and subject to the 4% Additional WHT, to a rate lower than 35%, or that have not been taxed under domestic law or due to the application of a reduced rate under a DTT.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CFC statute provides that taxpayers or affectation equities ('*patrimonios de afectación*') incorporated, resident, or domiciled in Chile have to recognise passive income (dividend, interest, royalties, etc.) directly or indirectly derived from controlled foreign entities, as long as this passive income exceeds 10% of the controlled entity's total revenues, in the corresponding calendar year. A tax credit will be granted for taxes paid or due abroad no matter how many levels down the chain separate the controlled entity from the Chilean entity, provided there is a DTT in force between Chile and the source country of the income.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Branches of foreign corporations operating in Chile are taxed on their worldwide income, subject to the FCT at the corresponding tax rate that varies depending on the income tax system to which the branch is subject to. If the branch is subject to the SME system, the FCT rate is 25%. If the branch is subject to the PIS, it is subject to an FCT rate of 27%.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
In order to avoid double taxation, the Chilean Income Tax Law recognises a tax credit mechanism in which the tax effectively paid abroad may be deducted from the taxes to be paid in Chile.
A foreign tax credit may be used even if the foreign tax was paid by an indirect subsidiary of the company remitting the funds to Chile, provided that all the entities are domiciled in the same country and that the remitting entity directly or indirectly participates in 10% or more of the equity of the company paying the foreign tax; and, as of 1 January 2017, it is possible to use a tax credit in Chile for taxes paid by a subsidiary domiciled in a third country if such subsidiary is domiciled in a country with which Chile has a DTT or an Exchange of Information Convention in force.
The foreign tax credit may be carried over for FCT purposes even if the company is in a tax loss situation or if the FCT is lower than the credit.
The total available foreign tax credit has a 35% cap.
As of 1 January 2017, the tax credit for taxes paid abroad is allocable against Chilean-source income, as foreign-source income is considered Chilean-source income once it is included in the taxpayer’s net taxable income and levied with Chilean taxes. Previously, as a general rule, the tax credit for taxes paid abroad was allocated only to foreign-source income.
## Investment incentives
The principal investment incentives are the following:
### Inbound investment incentives under Law Decree No. 600 (Foreign Investment Statute)
The principal incentives to encourage foreign capital contributions are statutory guarantees covering the repatriation of capital, remittance of profits, non-discrimination toward foreign investment, and access to the foreign exchange market for remittance purposes. In general, foreign investors are subject to the same legislation as national investors. A guaranteed income tax rate of 42% may be granted for ten years or, provided the capital investment project exceeds USD 50 million, 20 years for the development of industrial or extractive projects, under Law Decree No. 600, which contemplates the execution of a Foreign Investment Agreement between the foreign investor and the Chilean government.
Under Law Decree No. 600 and the corresponding Foreign Investment Agreement, the overall rate is comprised of the corporate tax on profits and WHT on dividend or branch profit distributions. The tax rate on dividend or profit distributions is the difference between 42% and the underlying tax paid at the corporate level. The option to be subject to an overall effective tax rate of 42% without change for ten or 20 years is usually not exercised by foreign investors because the current combined effective tax rate on profits and dividend distribution is 35% under the general tax regime.
Under the Foreign Investment Agreement, a foreign investor may request for tax stability with respect to VAT and customs duty regimes. With respect to customs duties, however, stability is granted only for the importation of certain machinery and equipment not available in Chile.
The Tax Reform established the elimination of Law Decree No. 600 as of 1 January 2016 with respect to new investment projects; however, Law No. 20,848, published in the Official Gazette on 25 June 2015, extended the enforceability of Law Decree No. 600 for four years more, counted as of 1 January 2016.
Foreign investors who have already entered into an investment agreement under Law Decree No. 600 with the Foreign Investment Committee will continue being subject to the laws applicable to such agreements according to current rules. On the contrary, new investments, as of 1 January 2016, will be able to opt between the foreign investment statute under Law Decree No. 600 and the new foreign investment statute established by Law No. 20,848.
Law No. 20,848 establishes the frame for ‘direct foreign investment’ in Chile and creates a Committee of Ministers for the promotion of foreign investment, as wells as an Agency for the promotion of foreign investment.
Please note that it is not mandatory for foreign investors to opt among one of these two foreign investment regimes, as they can freely invest in Chile as long as they do it through the formal exchange market.
## Export incentives
The principal incentives for exports can be summarised as follows:
Chile has signed FTAs or Economic Association Agreements (EAAs) with Australia, Canada, Central America (i.e. Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua), China, Colombia, the European Free Trade Association (i.e. Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland; EFTA), the European Union (EU), Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Pacific 4 (i.e. with Brunei, New Zealand, and Singapore; P4), Panama, Peru, Republic of South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, the United States, and Vietnam. All these agreements provide for reduced or zero-rate customs duties.

## Reporting on investments in Chile and abroad
### Chilean foreign investment
Taxpayers must file an annual affidavit informing all the investments performed during the previous year, pointing out the amount, kind of investment, country, purpose, and any other additional information the SII may require.
## Low-tax jurisdictions
Law No. 21,713 modified the requirements to qualify as a low-tax jurisdiction or preferential tax regime. In this sense, a jurisdiction will be deemed to have a preferential tax regime if it meets the following cumulative requirements:
Finally, the reference to the non-application of this article to OECD member countries is removed.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement
On 5 March 2014, Chile entered into a bilateral intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States (US) in order to comply with FATCA.
Chile signed a Model 2 IGA, which is a non-reciprocal exchange of information agreement. The execution of this agreement will imply that Chilean financial institutions with US account holders, in order to avoid paying the 30% rate WHT that FATCA establishes, will have to register with the US Treasury and US IRS and sign a Foreign Financial Institutions Agreement with them in order to be FATCA compliant.
In this context, each Chilean financial institution that enters into these agreements with the US tax authorities will be required to report to the US IRS directly the individual US account holder’s information.
In accordance with the Chilean Bank Secrecy Law, Chilean financial institutions, in respect to those account holders that do not authorise them to disclose their account information to the US IRS, will only be able to disclose their information in aggregate. This will mean that the US IRS, in order to obtain the specific information of those US account holders, will need to request it directly from the SII, under the terms of the treaty between both countries.
## Bank secrecy
Law No. 21,713 of 2024 modified the provisions regarding bank secrecy. Now there are two different procedures for lifting the banking secrecy: (i) a general procedure, subject to judicial oversight, similar to the one currently in place but with shorter timeframes and greater protections for the taxpayer; and (ii) an exceptional procedure for qualified cases that would be more aligned with the lifting of banking secrecy as outlined in the Economic Intelligence Bill.
Each procedure has specific cases where it can apply and different requirements and deadlines.
## Taxation applicable to funds
Public investment funds, private investment funds, and mutual funds are not considered as FCT payers, but their managing entities need to keep a number of registries in order to determine the taxation applicable to their quota holders regarding the amounts distributed by the fund.
Taxation of funds is similar to taxation of shares of a stock corporation. In this sense, dividends distribution would be treated as a distribution from a stock corporation subject to PIS. In case of capital gains, it would be considered as an alienation of shares of a stock corporation, in this sense, alienation could be tax exempted if funds are regularly traded or 90% or more of their portfolio is invested in regularly traded securities.
Please bear in mind that quota holders that are not domiciled or resident in Chile are just subject to a sole tax rated 10% or tax exempted in case they invest in public investments funds that have 80% of their assets located abroad.
## Duty of information and start-up activities
Law No. 21,713 of 2024, as part of measures against tax evasion, includes modifications to the duties of information disclosure and adds the obligation for various public and private entities to require a declaration of start-up of activities from their users.
The statute of limitations is extended by 12 months if the omission of the reporting duties regulated by Article 68 is detected in cases where the non-compliance is intended to avoid tax payment, conceal the taxpayer, or avoid the application of a special or general anti-avoidance rule
The obligation is introduced for banking and financial entities to provide information to the SII when the account holder has verified that, within a single day, week, or month, more than 50 credits have been made from 50 or more different individuals or entities, or that, within a six-month period, at least 100 credits from 100 different individuals or entities have been made. All of the account holder's accounts must be considered for counting the credits, and this information may serve as the basis for an audit process.
## Business reorganisations
Law No. 21,713 modified some rules regarding business reorganisations. The new article redefines the cases in which business reorganisations (national or international) will be considered tax-neutral (with the power to assess being inhibited).
The SII may assess an act, agreement, or operation that serves as the basis or is one of the elements to determine a tax when the price or value in these cases differs significantly from normal market values. The SII must issue a summons for the taxpayer to provide all evidence that can verify whether the act, agreement, or operation was carried out at normal market values.
It is important to highlight that the power to assess will also not apply to mergers and demergers, whether national or international, as long as the tax basis of the assets is maintained in the absorbing or newly created company from a merger, in the company or companies created as a result of a demerger, or in the one receiving the contribution of one or more assets, and no actual cash flows arise for the contributor. Therefore, the requirement for a legitimate business purpose in the case of mergers and demergers, as contemplated in the original bill, was eliminated.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
On 29 January 2020, the Chilean Congress approved the so called 'Modernisation Tax Bill' after a year and a half of discussion. Regarding taxation of individuals, the major amendment introduced by the Tax Reform is the increase of the Global Complementary Tax and Employment Tax maximum rates from 35% to 40%, as of 1 January 2020.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Resident foreigners are taxed on their salary, deducting social security contributions. Non-resident foreigners cannot deduct social security contributions before acquiring Chilean residence.
In general, all expenses incurred that are in the employer’s sole interest are duly deductible. Among these are travel and lodging expenses and documented entertainment. No blanket or standard deductions, such as representation allowances, are allowed for dependant employees.
## Personal deductions
### Mortgage interest expenses
Individuals resident in Chile may deduct from their respective taxable base the amount of the interest paid for mortgage loans destined to the purchase or construction of one or more dwellings. The annual deduction may not exceed 8 annual tax units; this limit is proportionally reduced according to the taxpayer’s income. The deduction is reduced to zero for taxpayers who have an annual income greater than 150 annual taxable units. The deduction should be claimed on the annual tax return (form 22).
### Voluntary pension contributions (APV)
A deduction can be taken for APV, up to a monthly limit of 50 UF or annual limit of 600 UF for resident employees. In the case of a dependent worker, such savings can be made monthly if the contribution is deducted by the employer or annually if the worker pays it directly to an authorised institution. In this situation, the worker should claim the deduction on the annual tax return (form 22). In practice, this contribution may only be made if the employee contributes to the ordinary Chilean Pension Scheme.
If the employee decides to withdraw one’s contribution, such amount will be provisionally taxed at a 15% rate, which will be used as a credit against the tax to be paid, which will be calculated considering the amount withdrawn and other incomes earned during the same year.
As of 1 January 2017, this tax benefit for individuals is eliminated due to the Tax Reform.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
## Employment income
Items such as reimbursements of travel expenses and housing provided in the employer’s sole interest, moving expenses, and a reasonable relocation allowance are considered non-taxable income and are excluded from the tax calculation.
Items such as cost-of-living allowance, area allowances, car allowance, vacation travel expenses, and utilities are taxable.
## Capital gains
There is no capital gains tax in Chile. Capital gains are taxed as normal income unless they are qualified by law as non-taxable income.
Certain gains on the sale of traded shares of Chilean corporations are tax exempted.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is taxed as normal income.
## Interest income
In the case of interest, only ’real interest’ (i.e. interest effectively paid less cost-of-living increase) is taxed as normal income.
## Exempt income
Specific tax treatment of exemption could be applied for share sales, dividends, mutual funds withdrawals, voluntary pension contributions (APV) withdrawals, and other capital gains obtained by a resident if the employee has only obtained dependant salary income.
As of 1 January 2017, the Tax Reform eliminates all benefits established under Article 57 bis of the Chilean Income Tax Law.
However, as of 1 October 2014, new Article 54 bis of the Chilean Income Tax Law is in force, providing a series of benefits that encourage savings by individuals, as it provides that the profits obtained due to the investment in certain securities are not subject to taxation as long as they (i) are not withdrawn, (ii) continue invested in such instruments or are reinvested in instruments of the same type, and (iii) other requirements are met.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Domicile is defined as physical presence with the intent to remain in the country. Residence is mere physical presence.
Residence for tax purposes is acquired upon remaining six consecutive months in the country in one calendar year, or more than six months, whether consecutive or not, in two consecutive calendar years. If domicile is acquired before residence and the intention is to stay in Chile permanently or for a significant period of time, normal taxation applies as of the date of entry into the country.
