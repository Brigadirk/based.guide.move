## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories generally are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Last in first out (LIFO) is not permitted for taxation purposes. First in first out (FIFO) is permitted. Conformity between book and tax reporting is not required.
## Capital gains
Profits from disposals of corporate 'titles' are unconditionally exempt from CIT. 'Titles' are defined as shares, bonds, debentures, founders’ shares, and other titles of companies or other legal persons incorporated in Cyprus or abroad and options thereon. According to a circular issued by the Cyprus tax authorities, the term includes, *inter alia*, futures/forwards on titles, short positions on titles, swaps on titles, depositary receipts on titles, repos on titles, units in stock exchange indices on titles, and units in open-ended or closed-ended collective investment schemes (including, inter alia, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities [UCITS], investment trusts and funds, mutual funds, and real estate investment trusts [REITs]).
## Dividend income
Dividends received from other Cyprus tax resident companies are exempt from all taxes, subject to certain anti-avoidance provisions.
Dividends earned from foreign investments are exempt from CIT in Cyprus, with the exception of dividends that are deductible for tax purposes for the paying company. Such deductible foreign dividends are subject to CIT and are exempt from SDC. Other (i.e. non-deductible) foreign dividend income is also exempt (participation exemption) from SDC unless:
In those cases where the above-mentioned Cyprus participation exemption on foreign dividend income is not available, any foreign WHT imposition on dividends paid to the Cyprus company will be credited against the Cyprus flat SDC rate of 17% on such dividends, without the need for a DTT to be in place with the paying jurisdiction. Furthermore, in some cases, a credit for underlying foreign tax (i.e. foreign tax on the paying company’s profits) is also available.
### Stock dividends
A Cyprus corporation can distribute tax-free dividends of common stock (bonus shares) proportionately to all common stock shareholders (under conditions).
## Interest income
## Royalty income
Royalty income is taxed under CIT, after deducting allowable expenses, at the rate of 12.5%.
## Rental income
## Foreign currency exchange (forex) differences
Forex differences are tax neutral for CIT purposes (i.e. forex gains are not taxable and forex losses are not deductible). However, forex differences arising from trading in foreign currencies (and related derivatives) are subject to CIT.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are subject to tax on their worldwide income. However, foreign PE income (*see below*), as well as most dividend and capital gains income from abroad (*see Dividend income above*), may be exempt from taxation in Cyprus.
Profits from a PE abroad are exempt from CIT, subject to anti-avoidance rules set out below.
The PE exemption is applicable, unless the below anti-avoidance rules apply:
Taxpayers may irrevocably elect to subject to CIT foreign PE profits.
Where foreign income is taxed in Cyprus, double taxation is avoided through granting tax credits for the foreign taxes, without the need for a DTT to be in place with the foreign jurisdiction. Transitional rules apply in certain cases on the granting of foreign tax credits where a foreign PE was previously exempt from taxation and subsequently a taxpayer elects to be subject to CIT on foreign PE profits.
## Hybrid mismatch rules

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Aside from certain cases where payments are made to companies in jurisdictions that are included on the EU blacklist, Cyprus does not levy a WHT on dividends, interests, and royalties paid to non-residents of Cyprus. Royalties on rights used within Cyprus are subject to WHT of 10% (5% in the case of cinematograph films). Such Cyprus WHT on royalties for rights used within Cyprus may be reduced or eliminated by DTTs entered into by Cyprus or by the EU Interest and Royalty Directive as transposed into the Cyprus tax legislation.
As of 31 December 2022, Cyprus applies WHT on certain payments to companies in jurisdictions included on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions on tax matters (commonly referred to as the EU ‘blacklist’) as follows:
## WHT on other types of income
Cyprus levies a 10% WHT on the remuneration of non-Cyprus tax residents for technical services derived from sources in Cyprus, subject to certain conditions. No such WHT is levied if such services are performed via a PE in Cyprus or between ‘associated’ companies as defined by the EU Interest and Royalty Directive as enacted into the Cyprus tax legislation.
Cyprus also levies a 10% WHT on the gross income/receipts derived from the exercise in Cyprus by a non-resident individual of any profession or vocation and the remuneration of non-resident public entertainers (e.g. theatrical, musical, football clubs, other athletic missions).
Further, a 5% WHT is levied on gross income derived from within Cyprus by non-residents with no local PE for services in regards to the exploration, extraction, or exploitation of the continental shelf, as well as the establishment and use of pipelines and other installations on the ground, on the seabed, and on the surface of the sea.
## WHT on dividend, interest, and royalties table
In the table below, we illustrate the applicable Cyprus WHT rates outbound for dividend, interest, and royalty payments.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Social security contributions
As of 1 January 2024, the employees' own contribution to the state-administered social insurance fund is 8.8% of their gross remuneration, with a maximum annual cap on insurable emoluments as of 1 January 2025 of EUR 66,612. The rate of 8.8% applies for both employee and the employer as of 1 January 2024 and for the next five years. Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 10.3% to 10.7% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039.
As of 1 January 2024, the contributions of self-employed persons are 16.6% of their income (15.6% for 2019 through 2023). Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 19.6% to 20.4% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039. The amount of the contributions is subject to a lower and a maximum limit, depending on the profession or trade of the self-employed person. These limits are set on an annual basis.
## General Health System (GHS)
As per General Health System Law of 2001 (89(I)/2001) as amended 2017, a GHS is introduced in Cyprus aimed to provide to the population equal access to a holistic health care system. Patients will have the option to select a health care provider from the private as well as the public health care sector.
Contributions relating to the implementation of the GHS commenced on 1 March 2019 at reduced rates. As of 1 March 2020, the full rates apply as per the table below:
| Ref | Category | Applied on | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Employees | Own emoluments | 2.65 |
| (ii) | Employers | Employees’ emoluments | 2.90 |
| (iii) | Self-employed | Own income | 4.00 |
| (iv) | Pensioners | Pension | 2.65 |
| (v) | Persons holding office\* | Officers’ remuneration | 2.65 |

\* Relates to holders of public or local authority office or other office, the income out of which does not come within the scope of (i) or (iii) or (iv) or (vii).
GHS contributions are capped at EUR 180,000 annual income.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT applies only to gains relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property when the disposal is not subject to income tax.
Disposal for the purposes of CGT specifically includes sale, exchange, lease, gifting, abandoning use of right, granting of right to purchase, and any sums received upon cancellation of disposals.
CGT at the rate of 20% is imposed on gains arising from the disposal of immovable property situated in Cyprus or the disposal of shares in companies that directly own Cyprus-situated immovable property. CGT is also imposed on disposals of shares in companies that indirectly own immovable property situated in Cyprus where at least 50% of the market value of the said shares derives from Cyprus-situated immovable property. Shares listed on any recognised stock exchange are excluded from CGT.
In the case of disposal of company shares, the gain is calculated exclusively on the basis of the gain relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property. The value of the immovable property will be its market value at the time the shares were disposed of.
The taxable gain is generally calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the original cost of the property plus any improvements as adjusted for inflation up to the date of disposal on the basis of the consumer price index in Cyprus. In the case of property acquired before 1 January 1980, the original cost is deemed to be the value of the property as of 1 January 1980 on the basis of the general valuation conducted by the Land Registry Office under the Immovable Property Law.
Other expenses that relate to the acquisition and disposal of immovable property are also deducted from the gain, subject to certain conditions (e.g. interest costs on related loans, transfer fees, legal expenses).
It is important to note that, subject to conditions, land, as well as land with buildings, acquired at market value (excluding exchanges, donations, and foreclosures) from unrelated parties in the period 16 July 2015 to 31 December 2016 will be exempt from CGT upon their future disposal.
### Lifetime exemptions
Individuals can deduct the following from the amount of the taxable capital gain:
| Capital gain arising from: | Deduction (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Disposal of private principal residence (subject to certain conditions) | 85,430 |
| Disposal of agricultural land by a farmer | 25,629 |
| Any other disposal | 17,086 |
The above exemptions are lifetime exemptions subject to an overall lifetime maximum of EUR 85,430.
Other exemptions are also available, under relevant conditions, including gifts between spouses, children (including foster children), and third degree relatives, gifts to family companies, gifts to charities, exchange of properties, donations to a political party, etc.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is imposed on the provision of goods and services in Cyprus as well as on the acquisition of goods from the European Union and the importation of goods into Cyprus. Taxable persons charge VAT on their taxable supplies (output tax) and are charged with VAT on goods or services that they received (input tax).
The standard VAT rate in Cyprus is 19%. Three reduced VAT rates, a 9% rate, a 5% rate, and a 3% rate, as well as a zero rate VAT, apply in Cyprus.
## Immovable property transfer fees
The fees charged by the Department of Land and Surveys to the acquirer for transfers of Cyprus-situated immovable property are as follows:
| Market value (EUR) | Rate (%) | Fee (EUR) | Accumulated fee (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First 85,000 | 3 | 2,550 | 2,550 |
| From 85,001 to 170,000 | 5 | 4,250 | 6,800 |
| Over 170,000 | 8 |  |  |
It is important to note that:
Certain debt-for-asset swap arrangements may, under certain conditions, be exempted from transfer fees.
In the case of free transfers of property, the transfer fees are calculated on the value of the property as follows (‘value’ in these cases refers to values as of 1 January 2013):
Mortgage registration fees are 1% of the current market value.
## Immovable property transfer levy
As of 22 February 2021, a 0.4% levy is imposed on the sale proceeds from all disposals of immovable property that is within the current control of the Republic of Cyprus. (i.e. both trading-nature and capital-nature disposals).
As of 18 November 2022, the levy applies on all disposals of immovable property as well as disposals of shares of a company that, directly or indirectly, holds immovable property.
In cases involving a direct disposal of immovable property, the levy is imposed on the disposal consideration, whereas in cases involving a disposal of shares of a company, the levy is imposed on the latest general valuation undertaken by the Department of Land and Surveys.
The obligation for payment of the levy lies with the seller.
The following direct or indirect disposals of immovable property are exempt:
During the period 22 February 2021 to 17 November 2022, different provisions applied with respect to certain aspects of the levy. For example, during this period the levy is applied only on disposals of immovable property itself and disposals of shares of a company that directly held immovable property to the extent that the buyer of the shares assumes control of such company.
## Immovable property tax (IPT)
IPT has been abolished as of 1 January 2017.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
All companies that are tax residents of Cyprus are taxed on their income accrued or derived from all sources in Cyprus and abroad. A non-Cyprus tax resident company is taxed on income accrued or derived from business activity that is carried out through a PE in Cyprus and on certain other income arising from sources in Cyprus.
The standard CIT rate in Cyprus is 12.5%.
## Special Defence Contribution (SDC)
SDC is imposed only on non-exempt dividend income, 'passive' interest income, and rental income earned by Cyprus tax resident companies and Cyprus PEs of non-Cyprus tax resident companies. Non-tax residents of Cyprus with non-Cyprus PEs are exempt from SDC.
Interest received by companies in the ordinary course of their business, including interest closely connected to the ordinary course of business, is also considered as ‘active’ interest income and is only taxed under CIT (after deducting allowable expenses) at the standard CIT rate of 12.5%.
When companies receive interest that does not satisfy the conditions prescribed immediately above, the interest is considered to be ‘passive’ interest income, which is subject to SDC (without expense deduction) at the rate of 17%. Such ‘passive’ nature interest is, however, exempt from CIT.
As of June 2022, 'passive' interest income earned from Cyprus government bonds, Cyprus and foreign corporate bonds listed on a recognised stock exchange, and bonds issued by Cyprus state organisations or by Cyprus or foreign local authorities listed on a recognised stock exchange shall be subject to SDC at the reduced rate of 3%. Moreover, as of 8 June 2022, Cyprus state organisations and local authorities, pension funds, provident funds, and the Cyprus Social Insurance Fund will be subject to SDC at the reduced rate of 3% on all interest income that they earn.
Interest received by close-ended or open-ended collective investment schemes (CISs) is never subject to SDC as it is considered as ‘active’ interest income and is subject to CIT.
Gross rental income reduced by 25% is also subject to SDC at the rate of 3% (i.e. effective rate of 2.25%) in addition to CIT (after deducting allowable expenses) of 12.5%.
On 13 September 2023, the Cyprus Tax Authority (CTA) issued a Circular pursuant of which rental income from self-catering accommodation that is rented out via online platforms will be treated, subject to certain conditions, as business income (therefore subject to CIT and exempt from SDC).
## Tonnage tax
For ship-owning companies, the profits derived by the owner of a ship registered in the European Union or European Economic Area (EEA) (as well as other foreign jurisdictions, subject to conditions) from its operation/charter out are fully exempt from all direct taxes. The term 'owner' includes a bareboat charterer of a non-Cyprus flag vessel parallel registered in Cyprus. A similar exemption applies to charterers and ship managers.
Bareboat charter out agreements remain eligible for tonnage tax, with restrictions introduced for bareboat charter agreements to third parties.
Instead of CIT, ship owners, charterers, and managers pay tonnage tax on the net tonnage of the ships they own, charter, or manage. For shipowners, there are also incentives provided for environmentally friendly Cyprus and/or EU/EEA flag vessels that can lead to a lower (up to 30%) tonnage tax liability. In addition, there is no tax on dividends paid at all levels of distribution by the above persons out of profits subject to tonnage tax and there is no taxation on the sale or transfer of a ship, share in a ship, or shares in a ship-owning company and their distributions. The same legislation also provides for income tax exemption of the salaries and benefits of the captain, the officers, and the crew aboard Cyprus and EU/EEA qualifying flag vessels engaged in qualifying activities.
This treatment applies until 31 December 2029 and is compulsory for Cyprus flag ship owners, but optional for other ship owners, charterers, and ship managers.
## Local income taxes
There are no local government taxes on income in Cyprus.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Personal income tax (PIT)
Cyprus PIT is imposed on the worldwide income of individuals who are tax residents in Cyprus. Individuals who are not tax residents of Cyprus are taxed only on certain types of income accrued or derived from sources in Cyprus.
The following table lists the PIT rates and bands currently applicable to individuals:
| Chargeable income for the tax year (EUR) | | Tax rate (%) | Accumulated tax (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 19,500 | 0 | 0 |
| 19,501 | 28,000 | 20 | 1,700 |
| 28,001 | 36,300 | 25 | 3,775 |
| 36,301 | 60,000 | 30 | 10,885 |
| 60,001 | and above | 35 |  |
## Special Defence Contribution (SDC)
SDC is imposed only on dividend, interest (most types), and rental income earned by individuals who are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for the purposes of the SDC.
For dividend (SDC rate of 17%) and interest income (SDC rate of 17%, except for interest income earned from Cyprus government bonds, Cyprus and foreign corporate bonds listed on a recognised stock exchange, or bonds issued by Cyprus state organisations or Cyprus or foreign local authorities listed on a recognised stock exchange, where a rate of 3% applies), SDC applies instead of PIT. For rental income (SDC effective rate of 2.25%), SDC applies in addition to PIT. However, on 13 September 2023, the Cypress Tax Authority (CTA) issued a Circular pursuant of which rental income from self-catering accommodation that is rented out via online platforms will be treated, subject to certain conditions, as business income (therefore subject to PIT and exempt from SDC).
Non-tax residents are exempt from SDC for all their income, whether earned from Cyprus or foreign sources. This exemption also applies to individuals who are Cyprus tax resident but not Cyprus domiciled for the purposes of SDC. Anti-abuse provisions apply.
An individual who does not have a 'Domicile of Origin' in Cyprus (as defined in the Wills and Succession Law) is only considered to be domiciled in Cyprus for SDC purposes when the individual has been a tax resident of Cyprus for a period of at least 17 years out of the last 20 years prior to the tax year in question. 'Domicile of Origin' is acquired at birth and, as a rule, is the same as the domicile of the father at the time of birth, and in exceptional cases of the mother. For those individuals with 'Domicile of Origin' in Cyprus, detailed rules are used to determine the individuals’ domicile status for SDC purposes.

# Cyprus
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Taxable period
In Cyprus, the tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Separate returns must be filed by each individual on a calendar-year basis. Submission deadlines vary depending on the individual taxpayer’s profile.
### Electronic submissions
All individuals should be registered online and submit their income tax returns electronically. In this respect, the deadlines for the electronic submission of income tax returns are as follows:
## Payment of taxes
There is an obligation for PIT withholding on salaries under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. If a taxpayer has other income not subject to withholding tax (WHT), payments of estimated tax must be generally paid in two equal instalments on 31 July and 31 December within the same tax year.
For (i) employees and pensioners whose incomes do not include income from a trade/business, rents, dividends, interest, royalties, nor income relating to trading goodwill, and (ii) individuals who have gross income that falls under Article 5 (includes dividends, interest, and profits from share dealings) and who are not required to prepare audited financial statements, a final balancing payment must be made by 31 July of the following year.
For self-employed individuals preparing audited financial statements, a final balancing payment must be made by 1 August of the following year.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is imposed on the supply of goods and services in Cyprus as well as on the acquisition of goods from the European Union and the importation of goods into Cyprus. Taxable persons charge VAT on their taxable supplies (output tax) and are charged with VAT on goods or services that they receive (input tax).
The standard VAT rate in Cyprus is 19%. Additionally, three reduced VAT rates, a 9% rate, a 5% rate, and a 3% rate, as well as a zero rate VAT, apply in Cyprus:
Exports from Cyprus are zero-rated (i.e. no VAT must be charged on the export, and the company is entitled to recover the relevant input VAT suffered). In addition, the supply, modification, repair, maintenance, chartering, and hiring of qualifying aircraft and qualifying vessels, as well as the supply of goods for the fuelling and provisioning of qualifying vessels and qualifying aircraft and the supply of services to meet the client needs of qualifying vessels/aircraft are also treated as zero-rated. An aircraft meets the definition of a qualifying aircraft where it is used by airlines operating for reward chiefly on international routes, and a qualifying vessel is the vessel that is used in the navigation on the high seas for industrial purposes.
Supplies of goods taking place outside the European Union are outside the scope of Cyprus VAT.
Certain supplies in the public interest, such as postal services, education services, medical services, and supplies of charities, are exempt from Cyprus VAT.
The supply of financial services is also exempt.
Supplies of buildings also are exempt from VAT unless the supply relates to new buildings before first use up to 10 November 2022. As of 11 November 2022, according to the VAT Law, as amended by R.A.A. 423/2022, the supply of a building is subject to VAT when supplied before its first delivery and under any subsequent deliveries within a period of five years from its completion, provided that no actual use has occurred by an unrelated person for a period of at least 24 months.
For the purposes of the above provision, the following definitions shall take precedence:
Over the past few years, a number of amendments to Cyprus VAT legislation concerning transactions in real estate were enacted. These amendments comprise of:
Other amendments in the Law include the following:
### VAT registration
VAT registration is compulsory for business with:
Businesses with turnover of less than EUR 15,600, or with supplies that are outside the scope of VAT but for which the right to claim the amount of the related input VAT is granted, have the option to register on a voluntary basis.
An obligation for registration also arises for businesses that:
No registration threshold exists for the provision of intra-Community supplies of goods and services.
Additionally, an obligation for registration arises for businesses carrying out economic activities as a result of the receipt of services from abroad for which an obligation to account for Cyprus VAT under the reverse-charge provision exists, subject to the registration threshold of EUR 15,600 per any consecutive 12-month period.
Supply of goods and services that are exempt from VAT, and disposals of items of capital nature, are not taken into account for determining the annual turnover for registration purposes.
As of 20 August 2020, taxpayers who are not established in Cyprus but are engaged or expect to be engaged in taxable activities in Cyprus in the course of their business also have the obligation to register for VAT purposes without a VAT registration threshold.
### VAT declaration and payment/return of VAT
VAT returns must be electronically submitted on a quarterly basis, and the payment of VAT must be made by the tenth day of the second month that follows the month in which the VAT period ends.
VAT-registered persons have the right to request for a different filing period. The approval of the Commissioner of Taxation is required. The Commissioner of Taxation also has the right to request for a taxable person to file their VAT returns for a different period.
Where, in a quarter, input VAT is higher than output VAT, the difference is refunded (subject to certain conditions) or is transferred for set-off against the VAT payable of the next VAT returns.
Taxpayers who make a claim for VAT refund will be entitled to repayment of the principal amounts together with interest in the event that the repayment is delayed for a period exceeding four months from the date of the submission of the claim.
The grace period for the Tax Department to repay the refundable amounts is extended by another four months (i.e. eight months in total) in the event that the Commissioner of Taxation is carrying out an investigation in relation to the submitted claim.
From 20 August 2020, VAT refunds will be suspended if the taxpayer:
## Customs duties
The nature and value of the goods, as well as the relevant TARIC classification codes, determine whether quotas and other measures apply, as well as the level of customs duties to be imposed. Specifically, the Common Customs Tariff stipulates a tax rate to be applied to the value or number of imported goods, depending on their type. It can either be represented as a fixed amount applied to a certain quantity (i.e. specific tax) or as a percentage applied to the customs value (i.e. *ad valorem* tax).
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on certain products, including petroleum, tobacco, and alcoholic drinks.
## Immovable property tax (IPT)
IPT has been abolished as of 1 January 2017.
## Stamp duty
The general rule is that Cyprus stamp duty is imposed only on written instruments relating to assets located in Cyprus or to matters that will take place in Cyprus. The applicable rates are based on the value stipulated in each instrument and are nil for values up to EUR 5,000, 0.15% for values from EUR 5,001 up to EUR 170,000, and 0.2% for values above EUR 170,000, subject to an overall maximum amount of stamp duty of EUR 20,000. Exemption from stamp duty applies in the case of a qualifying reorganisation scheme.
## Capital duty
As of 18 December 2018, capital duty of 0.6% on the authorised share capital or any increases thereof has been abolished.
As a result, no capital duty is imposed from that date onwards on (i) the initial authorised share capital upon incorporation of a new company, and (ii) any subsequent increase of authorised share capital.
The EUR 105 upon incorporation of a new company and the EUR 20 for the issuance of an 'issue and allotment of shares' certificate as regards (i) issued share capital upon incorporation if the shares are issued at a premium, and (ii) any subsequent increase of issued share capital, whether the shares are issued at nominal value or at a premium, remain applicable (i.e. not unaffected by the abolition of capital duty).
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT applies only to gains relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property when the disposal is not subject to CIT.
Disposal for the purposes of CGT specifically includes sale, exchange, lease, gifting, abandoning use of right, granting of right to purchase, and any sums received upon cancellation of disposals.
CGT at the rate of 20% is imposed on gains arising from the disposal of immovable property situated in Cyprus or the disposal of shares in companies that own Cyprus-situated immovable property. CGT is also imposed on disposals of shares in companies that indirectly own immovable property situated in Cyprus where at least 50% of the market value of the said shares derives from Cyprus-situated immovable property. Shares listed on any recognised stock exchange are excluded from CGT.
In the case of disposal of company shares, the gain is calculated exclusively on the basis of the gain relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property. The value of the immovable property will be its market value at the time the shares were disposed of.
The taxable gain is generally calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the original cost of the property plus any improvements as adjusted for inflation up to the date of disposal on the basis of the consumer price index in Cyprus. In the case of property acquired before 1 January 1980, the original cost is deemed to be the value of the property as at 1 January 1980 on the basis of the general valuation conducted by the Land Registry Office under the Immovable Property Law.
Other expenses that relate to the acquisition and disposal of immovable property are also deducted from the gain, subject to certain conditions (e.g. interest costs on related loans, transfer fees, legal expenses).
It is important to note that, subject to conditions, land, as well as land with buildings, acquired at market value (excluding exchanges, donations, and foreclosures) from unrelated parties in the period 16 July 2015 to 31 December 2016 will be exempt from CGT upon their future disposal.
Finally, certain disposals are totally exempt from CGT based on their nature (e.g. gifts from parents to children or between spouses).
## Immovable property transfer fees
The fees charged by the Department of Land and Surveys to the acquirer for transfers of Cyprus-situated immovable property are as follows:
| Market value (EUR) | Rate (%) | Fee (EUR) | Accumulated fee (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Up to 85,000 | 3 | 2,550 | 2,550 |
| 85,001 to 170,000 | 5 | 4,250 | 6,800 |
| Over 170,000 | 8 |  |  |
It is important to note that:
Certain debt-for-asset swap arrangements may, under certain conditions, be exempted from transfer fees.
Mortgage registration fees are 1% of the current market value.
In the case of companies’ reorganisations, transfers of immovable property are not subject to transfer fees or mortgage registration fees.
## Immovable property transfer levy
As of 22 February 2021, a levy of 0.4% applies on all disposals of immovable property that are within the current control of the Republic of Cyprus (i.e. both trading-nature and capital-nature disposals).
As of 18 November 2022, the levy applies on all disposals of immovable property as well as disposals of shares of a company that directly or indirectly holds immovable property.
In cases involving a direct disposal of immovable property, the levy is imposed on the disposal consideration, whereas in cases involving a disposal of shares of a company, the levy is imposed on the latest general valuation undertaken by the Department of Land and Surveys.
The obligation for payment of the levy lies with the seller.
The following direct or indirect disposals of immovable property are exempt:
During the period 22 February 2021 to 17 November 2022, different provisions applied with respect to certain aspects of the levy. For example, during this period, the levy is applied only on disposals of immovable property itself and disposals of shares of a company that directly held immovable property to the extent that the buyer of the shares assumes control of such company.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to the employers' own contributions on their employees’ gross salaries (*see below*), employers are also responsible to withhold from employees’ earnings the employees’ contributions to the social insurance fund, General Healthcare System (GHS), and employees' personal income tax (PIT) burden through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.
## Social security contributions
Employed persons are compulsorily insured under a state-administered social insurance fund. Contributions to the fund are borne by both employer and employee. The employer’s contributions are calculated as a percentage of the employee’s earnings. The employer also contributes to other funds as set out in the table below:
| Funds | Employer contribution (% of employee’s earnings) (1) |
| --- | --- |
| Social insurance fund | 8.8 (2, 3) |
| Redundancy fund | 1.2 |
| Training development fund | 0.5 |
| Social cohesion fund | 2.0 |
| GHS contributions | 2.90 (3, 4) |
| Holiday fund (if not exempt) | 8.0 |
Notes
1. With the exception of the social cohesion fund, the maximum amount of monthly earnings on which the contributions are paid is EUR 5,551 for 2025 (EUR 5,239 for 2024). This maximum is usually adjusted for inflation annually at the beginning of each calendar year.
2. The rate of 8.8% applies for both the employer and the employee as of 1 January 2024 and for the next five years. Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 10.3% to 10.7% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039.
3. The employee must also contribute at the same rate as the employer to the social insurance fund and the GHS fund at 8.8% and 2.65%, respectively (*see 4 below*), but not to the other funds. It is the employer’s responsibility to withhold this contribution upon payment of employee’s earnings.
4. GHS contributions are capped at EUR 180,000 annual income.
## Exit taxes
A Cyprus CIT payer will be subject to the Cyprus exit taxation provisions in cases where assets are transferred outside the Cyprus income tax net (outbound transfers) in any of the following circumstances:
Under certain conditions, temporary transfers of assets falling within the above-mentioned categories are excluded from the scope of the exit taxation provisions.
### Amount subject to tax
In the circumstances outlined above, at the time of the transfer the taxpayer is deemed to have transferred the assets at an amount equal to their market value at that time, such that any profit thereon is calculated as the difference between that market value less their value for tax purposes at that time. Such profit is subject to CIT law provisions (e.g. the transfer of a qualifying ‘title’ [such as shares in a company] will be exempt upon transfer as qualifying titles are exempt from Cyprus income tax).
### Deferral of payment of tax
Where there is a transfer subject to Cyprus CIT (*see above*), it is chargeable to tax at the time of transfer. In certain cases, the taxpayer has the choice to make the relevant CIT payment in instalments over a period of five years. Deferral of payment is a possible option for the taxpayer only in cases where the transfer is to another EU member state, or an EEA state with which Cyprus (or the European Union) has an agreement on the recovery of tax claims equivalent to the mutual assistance provided for in the EU Directive (2010/24/EU) concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties, and other measures.
When a taxpayer opts for payment of tax in instalments, then the Cyprus tax authorities will charge interest. Additionally, the Cyprus tax authorities may, in certain cases, request a guarantee.
If certain future events occur, deferral of payment of tax will be immediately discontinued and the balance of the tax debt will become immediately payable.
### Inbound transfers
Where assets are transferred to Cyprus from another EU member state under the same scope as for outbound transfers (*see above*), then the assets’ starting value for tax purposes in Cyprus is the value at the time of transfer as established by the transferor EU member state (unless this does not reflect the assets’ market value at that time).

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Social security contributions
As of 1 January 2024, the employees' own contribution to the state-administered social insurance fund is 8.8% of their gross remuneration, with a maximum annual cap on insurable emoluments as of 1 January 2025 of EUR 66,612. The rate of 8.8% applies for both employee and the employer as of 1 January 2024 and for the next five years. Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 10.3% to 10.7% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039.
As of 1 January 2024, the contributions of self-employed persons are 16.6% of their income (15.6% for 2019 through 2023). Thereafter, the rate will increase every five years until it reaches 19.6% to 20.4% (depending on the results of the actuarial studies to be performed) as of 1 January 2039. The amount of the contributions is subject to a lower and a maximum limit, depending on the profession or trade of the self-employed person. These limits are set on an annual basis.
## General Health System (GHS)
As per General Health System Law of 2001 (89(I)/2001) as amended 2017, a GHS is introduced in Cyprus aimed to provide to the population equal access to a holistic health care system. Patients will have the option to select a health care provider from the private as well as the public health care sector.
Contributions relating to the implementation of the GHS commenced on 1 March 2019 at reduced rates. As of 1 March 2020, the full rates apply as per the table below:
| Ref | Category | Applied on | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Employees | Own emoluments | 2.65 |
| (ii) | Employers | Employees’ emoluments | 2.90 |
| (iii) | Self-employed | Own income | 4.00 |
| (iv) | Pensioners | Pension | 2.65 |
| (v) | Persons holding office\* | Officers’ remuneration | 2.65 |
| (vi) | Republic of Cyprus or natural/ legal person responsible for the remuneration of persons holding an office | Officers’ remuneration | 2.90 |
| (vii) | Persons earning rental, interest, dividend, and other income | Rental, interest, dividend income, etc. | 2.65 |
| (viii) | Republic’s Consolidated Fund | Emoluments/pensions of persons (i), (iii), (iv), and (v) | 4.70 |
\* Relates to holders of public or local authority office or other office, the income out of which does not come within the scope of (i) or (iii) or (iv) or (vii).
GHS contributions are capped at EUR 180,000 annual income.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT applies only to gains relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property when the disposal is not subject to income tax.
Disposal for the purposes of CGT specifically includes sale, exchange, lease, gifting, abandoning use of right, granting of right to purchase, and any sums received upon cancellation of disposals.
CGT at the rate of 20% is imposed on gains arising from the disposal of immovable property situated in Cyprus or the disposal of shares in companies that directly own Cyprus-situated immovable property. CGT is also imposed on disposals of shares in companies that indirectly own immovable property situated in Cyprus where at least 50% of the market value of the said shares derives from Cyprus-situated immovable property. Shares listed on any recognised stock exchange are excluded from CGT.
In the case of disposal of company shares, the gain is calculated exclusively on the basis of the gain relating to Cyprus-situated immovable property. The value of the immovable property will be its market value at the time the shares were disposed of.
The taxable gain is generally calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the original cost of the property plus any improvements as adjusted for inflation up to the date of disposal on the basis of the consumer price index in Cyprus. In the case of property acquired before 1 January 1980, the original cost is deemed to be the value of the property as of 1 January 1980 on the basis of the general valuation conducted by the Land Registry Office under the Immovable Property Law.
Other expenses that relate to the acquisition and disposal of immovable property are also deducted from the gain, subject to certain conditions (e.g. interest costs on related loans, transfer fees, legal expenses).
It is important to note that, subject to conditions, land, as well as land with buildings, acquired at market value (excluding exchanges, donations, and foreclosures) from unrelated parties in the period 16 July 2015 to 31 December 2016 will be exempt from CGT upon their future disposal.
### Lifetime exemptions
Individuals can deduct the following from the amount of the taxable capital gain:
| Capital gain arising from: | Deduction (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Disposal of private principal residence (subject to certain conditions) | 85,430 |
| Disposal of agricultural land by a farmer | 25,629 |
| Any other disposal | 17,086 |
The above exemptions are lifetime exemptions subject to an overall lifetime maximum of EUR 85,430.
Other exemptions are also available, under relevant conditions, including gifts between spouses, children (including foster children), and third degree relatives, gifts to family companies, gifts to charities, exchange of properties, donations to a political party, etc.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is imposed on the provision of goods and services in Cyprus as well as on the acquisition of goods from the European Union and the importation of goods into Cyprus. Taxable persons charge VAT on their taxable supplies (output tax) and are charged with VAT on goods or services that they received (input tax).
The standard VAT rate in Cyprus is 19%. Three reduced VAT rates, a 9% rate, a 5% rate, and a 3% rate, as well as a zero rate VAT, apply in Cyprus.
## Immovable property transfer fees
The fees charged by the Department of Land and Surveys to the acquirer for transfers of Cyprus-situated immovable property are as follows:
| Market value (EUR) | Rate (%) | Fee (EUR) | Accumulated fee (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First 85,000 | 3 | 2,550 | 2,550 |
| From 85,001 to 170,000 | 5 | 4,250 | 6,800 |
| Over 170,000 | 8 |  |  |
It is important to note that:
Certain debt-for-asset swap arrangements may, under certain conditions, be exempted from transfer fees.
In the case of free transfers of property, the transfer fees are calculated on the value of the property as follows (‘value’ in these cases refers to values as of 1 January 2013):
Mortgage registration fees are 1% of the current market value.
## Immovable property transfer levy
As of 22 February 2021, a 0.4% levy is imposed on the sale proceeds from all disposals of immovable property that is within the current control of the Republic of Cyprus. (i.e. both trading-nature and capital-nature disposals).
As of 18 November 2022, the levy applies on all disposals of immovable property as well as disposals of shares of a company that, directly or indirectly, holds immovable property.
In cases involving a direct disposal of immovable property, the levy is imposed on the disposal consideration, whereas in cases involving a disposal of shares of a company, the levy is imposed on the latest general valuation undertaken by the Department of Land and Surveys.
The obligation for payment of the levy lies with the seller.
The following direct or indirect disposals of immovable property are exempt:
During the period 22 February 2021 to 17 November 2022, different provisions applied with respect to certain aspects of the levy. For example, during this period the levy is applied only on disposals of immovable property itself and disposals of shares of a company that directly held immovable property to the extent that the buyer of the shares assumes control of such company.
## Immovable property tax (IPT)
IPT has been abolished as of 1 January 2017.

# Cyprus
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Taxable period
In Cyprus, the tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Business organisations are required to prepare audited accounts based on generally accepted auditing standards. Tax returns are completed based on these accounts on a calendar-year basis.
### Electronic submission
Companies should be registered online and submit their annual tax returns electronically. The submission deadline for a given year is 31 March of the second year thereafter.
## Payment of tax
Corporate entities must pay provisional tax on the current year’s income. Such provisional tax payment is made in two equal instalments on 31 July and 31 December of the tax year. A final balancing payment must be made on or before 1 August of the following year on a self-assessment basis to bring the total payments of tax to the total actually due according to the tax return.
## Tax audit process
The Cyprus tax process is one of self-assessment. Following the filing of a tax return, the CTD has 6 years from the end of the relevant tax year to raise an enquiry (12 years in cases of established fraud or wilful default). These can range from simple information requests to detailed technical challenges over treatments adopted in the tax return.
Any enquiries are often conducted between the taxpayer and the CTD by exchange of information via correspondence and meetings. Where agreement cannot be reached, litigation may be necessary.
A taxpayer may also proactively request that the CTD review the company’s ‘open’ tax years if the taxpayer requires a tax clearance certificate (e.g. upon commencement of voluntary liquidation).
For companies in a tax-loss position per the self-assessment return, the CTD is not restricted to the above-mentioned six-year (or 12-year) period; however, outside of this period, any adjustments may only reduce or nullify a loss.
Tax authorities generally focus on the tax statements being computed based on generally accepted auditing standards prepared and audited financial statements and on the principles of taxation as per the tax laws and their issued circulars.

# Cyprus
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Cyprus is expanding and updating its double tax treaty (DTT) network. A first-time Cyprus-Netherlands DTT entered into force as of 30 June 2023 and is effective as of 1 January 2024. A first-time Cyprus-Croatia DTT was signed and entered into force in 2023 and became effective as of 1 January 2024. A revised Cyprus-France DTT was signed on 11 December 2023 and is now awaiting ratification before it becomes effective.
Cyprus signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures (MLI) to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) on 7 June 2017.  Subsequently, Cyprus ratified the MLI on 23 January 2020. The date of 'entry into effect' as regards Cyprus’ application of the MLI for any particular bilateral DTT covered by the MLI depends upon various possible legal processes/options by the other contracting jurisdiction.
Cyprus has also successfully transposed into its legal and tax framework all European Union (EU) Directives on Administrative Cooperation and Mutual Assistance (DACs 1-5). Furthermore, on 30 March 2021, the law transposing the DAC6 Directive entered into force with retroactive effect covering transactions from 25 June 2018 and onwards.
With effect as of 1 January 2022, transfer pricing documentation requirements have been introduced. The transfer pricing documentation compliance obligations include the preparation of Master File, Cyprus Local File, Summary Table, and Minimum Transfer Pricing Documentation for Cyprus tax resident persons and permanent establishments (PEs) of non-Cyprus tax resident persons situated in Cyprus that engage in transactions with related parties.
As of 31 December 2022, Cyprus applies withholding tax (WHT) on certain payments to companies in jurisdictions included on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions on tax matters (commonly referred to as the EU ‘blacklist’) as follows:
The application of tax incentives relating to investments in innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been extended to 31 December 2026.
Also, Cyprus, as an EU member state, has transposed the EU Directive on global minimum tax for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups into its national law, with effect from 1 January 2024. However, Cyprus will not be introducing a domestic minimum tax regime of its own until 1 January 2025.
Finally, with effect as of 1 January 2023, a new deduction and increased wear and tear rates for capital expenses on certain environment-friendly assets were introduced. These new provisions are applicable for tax years 2023-2026.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
A company is tax resident of Cyprus if it is managed and controlled in Cyprus.
As of 2023, a Cyprus incorporated company is by default considered a tax resident of Cyprus provided it is not tax resident in any other jurisdiction.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Cyprus domestic income tax legislation explicitly provides for the determination of a taxable Cyprus PE of a non-Cyprus tax resident company. These specific legislative provisions are broadly in line with the relevant article of the 2014 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model DTT, with the addition of offshore activities relating to the exploration, extraction, or exploitation of the seabed, subsoil, and natural resources, as well as the installation and exploitation of pipelines and other installations on the seabed.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
For tangible assets, depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis at set rates that vary, depending on the type of asset. On the sale of such depreciated property, tax depreciation may be recaptured through a balancing statement computed upon disposal and taxed as ordinary income, depending upon the level of sale proceeds.
Property and equipment acquired during the tax years 2012 through 2018 are eligible for accelerated tax depreciation at the rate of 20% *per annum* (excluding assets that are already eligible for a higher annual rate of tax depreciation).
Industrial and hotel buildings acquired during the tax years 2012 through 2018 are eligible for accelerated tax depreciation at the rate of 7% *per annum*.
Capital expenses on certain environment-friendly assets incurred during tax years 2023-2026 are eligible for accelerated tax depreciation as follows:
Land does not attract tax depreciation.
Tax amortisation on any expenditure of a capital nature for the acquisition or development of IP is introduced with effect from 1 July 2016 and is allocated over the lifetime of the IP, in accordance with accepted accounting principles, with a maximum period of 20 years (excluding goodwill and IPs falling under the transitional rules of the old Cyprus IP box, which continue with that box’s tax amortisation). A taxpayer may elect not to claim all or part of the available tax amortisation for a particular tax year. With effect from 1 January 2020, the requirement of preparing a balancing statement upon disposal of the IP has been abolished.
## Goodwill
Any amounts paid for the acquisition of trading goodwill should be deductible upon the subsequent sale of such trading goodwill.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses, such as formation expenses, are generally not tax deductible in the computation of the company’s taxable income.
Any such expenditure of capital nature is tax amortised in a reasonable manner over its useful economic life (as per accepted accounting principles) with a maximum period of 20 years without any tax amortisation recapture upon a future disposal of the intangible.
For any such expenditure incurred during the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, an additional allowance is granted equal to 20% of the expenditure incurred, which (i) cannot be claimed in parallel with the 80% allowance on net profit under the Cyprus nexus IP regime (i.e. cannot be claimed in parallel with New Cyprus IP Box) and (ii) a person may elect, for each tax year, to waive claiming (in whole or in part).
## Interest expenses
Generally, interest expenses incurred by the company for the generation of taxable income should be deductible in the company’s tax computation.
Interest expense that finances assets that generate tax-exempt income is not deductible in the first seven years of ownership of such assets. Interest expense associated with such assets held beyond seven years becomes tax deductible from thereon.
Interest expense financing the acquisition of 100% shareholdings in subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly trading is deductible, provided that the acquisition was made on or after 1 January 2012.
As of 1 January 2019, an interest limitation rule applies in accordance with the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). *See Interest limitation rule in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section for more information*.
## Bad debts
Bad debts of any business should generally be deductible, provided they are write-offs/provisions against specific trading receivables and the taxpayer can evidently prove that sufficient steps were taken beforehand to recover them.
## Charitable contributions
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not deductible in the computation of the taxable income of the company.
## Taxes
Taxes that are deducted in computing profits for CIT purposes include VAT not recovered and the employer’s share of contributions to the social insurance and other employee-related funds.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward (from the end of the tax year in which the loss occurred) and set-off against taxable profits of the next five years. Carryback of tax losses is not permitted. Under certain conditions, they may also be eligible for group relief (*see the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Cyprus corporation can claim a deduction for royalties and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, and a reasonable amount of head office expenses of an overseas company, provided such expenditures can be justified as having been incurred in the production of the income and subject to the rules generally applicable for the deduction of such expenditure.
In the case of insurance companies, the amount of head office expenses should not exceed 3% of the net premiums in Cyprus for the general insurance business and 2% for the life insurance business.
## Hybrid mismatch rules
The hybrid mismatch rules cover situations of ‘double deduction’ or ‘deduction without inclusion’ relating to hybrid entities, hybrid financial instruments, hybridity involving PEs, imported mismatches, and tax residency mismatches. The tax provisions also include rules on hybrid transfers and on reverse hybrid entities.
Generally, in order for the hybrid mismatch rules to be in scope, the hybridity needs to involve associated enterprises, an HO and a PE (or two or more PEs of the same entity) or a structured arrangement (this is when the mismatch is priced into the terms of an arrangement).
The hybrid mismatch rules aim to ‘neutralise’ the hybrid tax position (e.g. by denying a tax deduction in Cyprus for a hybrid payment made by a Cyprus entity). The ‘neutralising’ rules only apply to those taxpayers subject to Cyprus CIT, with the exception of the reverse hybrid rule, which may apply more broadly.
The Cyprus transposition law provides that the annual deduction on new equity granted under the Cyprus notional interest deduction (NID) regime, as well as similar deductions granted by other jurisdictions, do not fall within the scope of Cyprus’ hybrid mismatch rules.
### Double deduction
To the extent that a hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction for tax purposes of a payment, expense, or loss, the deduction shall be denied in Cyprus if Cyprus is the investor jurisdiction. If Cyprus is not the investor jurisdiction but rather is the payer jurisdiction, then Cyprus would again deny deduction but only in the case where the investor jurisdiction has not itself denied the deduction.
Nevertheless, any deduction shall be eligible for off-setting against current or future dual inclusion income. Dual inclusion income is income that is included for tax purposes in both Cyprus and in the other jurisdiction.
### Deduction without inclusion
To the extent that a hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion for tax purposes of a payment (or deemed payment between an HO and PE or between two or more PEs of the same entity), the deduction shall be denied in Cyprus if Cyprus is the payer jurisdiction. If Cyprus is not the payer jurisdiction but rather is the recipient jurisdiction, then Cyprus should tax the income except in the following cases, as Cyprus has opted, under the possibilities provided for in the Directive, not to apply the hybrid rule of taxation of income to: (i) a payment to a hybrid entity or (ii) a payment or a deemed payment involving PEs and hybridity. *However, see below for the specific cases of disregarded PEs and reverse hybrid entities*.
Temporarily excluded from the ‘deduction without inclusion’ rule, are, under certain conditions, hybrid mismatches resulting from intra-group financial instruments issued with the sole purpose of meeting the issuer’s loss-absorbing capacity requirements (e.g. regulatory hybrid capital). This temporary exclusion for such financial instruments applies until 31 December 2022.
The law provides that these new provisions do not apply in cases where Cyprus will include (for tax purposes) dividend income for dividends that have a deduction (for tax purposes) in the jurisdiction of their payment. This is because the rules in effect in Cyprus since 2016 already deal with this hybridity.
### Imported mismatch
Imported mismatches are essentially payments from Cyprus that indirectly fund hybrid mismatches between parties outside of Cyprus. These can also result in a denial of deduction in Cyprus for the payment in cases where the other parties involved in the hybrid mismatch have not made adjustments to neutralise the hybrid mismatch.
### Disregarded PE income
Cyprus requires income inclusion for tax purposes to the extent a hybrid mismatch involves income of a disregarded exempt foreign PE, unless a DTT concluded with a third country (i.e. with a non-EU member state) requires Cyprus to exempt the income. A disregarded PE is one where the HO jurisdiction considers the resident taxpayer to have a PE in another jurisdiction, but the other jurisdiction views matters differently and does not consider there to be a PE in its jurisdiction.
### Hybrid transfer
To the extent a hybrid transfer is designed to produce WHT relief for more than one of the parties involved, then Cyprus shall limit the relief it grants to the Cyprus taxpayer in proportion to the net taxable income in Cyprus. A hybrid transfer is where an arrangement to transfer a financial instrument results in the underlying return on that instrument being considered for tax purposes to be derived simultaneously by more than one party in the arrangement.
### Reverse hybrid entities
A reverse hybrid entity is an entity that is not considered to be a taxpayer in its jurisdiction of incorporation or establishment (e.g. a partnership where the partners are considered to be the taxpayer and not the partnership itself) but is considered as a taxable entity when viewed from the investor’s jurisdiction perspective.
A reverse hybrid entity, under conditions, shall be regarded as a resident of Cyprus in cases where Cyprus is the jurisdiction of incorporation or establishment of the entity, and shall be subject to Cyprus CIT (and Cyprus SDC) on its income to the extent this income is not otherwise taxed in Cyprus or in any other jurisdiction.
This rule shall not apply to collective investment vehicles set up in accordance with the Open-Ended Undertakings for Collective Investment (UCI) law and the Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) law.
This rule is effective as of 1 January 2022.
### Tax residency mismatches
To the extent that the dual (or more) tax residency status of a taxpayer results in a double deduction of a payment, expense, or loss, Cyprus shall deny deduction insofar as the duplicate deduction is set off in the other jurisdiction against non-dual-inclusion income (dual inclusion income is income that is included for tax purposes in both Cyprus and the other jurisdiction).
In cases where the other jurisdiction is another EU member state, the ‘loser’ state under the tax residency tie-breaker rule of the relevant DTT between Cyprus and that other EU member state shall deny the deduction.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Group relief provisions allow, subject to certain conditions, companies of the same group to transfer tax losses from loss-making group companies to profitable group companies. A group includes a Cyprus company directly or indirectly holding at least 75% of the voting shares of another Cyprus tax resident company or two or more Cyprus tax resident companies are at least 75% (voting shares) held, directly or indirectly, by a third company.
The interposition of a non-Cyprus tax resident company(ies) will not affect the eligibility for group relief as long as such company(ies) is tax resident in either another EU member state or a country with which Cyprus has in place a DTT or an exchange of information agreement (which may be bilateral or multilateral).
Further, a Cyprus tax resident company may also claim the tax losses of a group company that is tax resident in another EU member state, provided such EU company firstly exhausts all possibilities available to utilise its losses in its EU member state of residence or in the EU member state of any intermediary EU holding company.
## Transfer pricing
As per the general provisions of the Cyprus tax legislation, transactions between related parties should be carried out on an arm's-length basis; otherwise, the Cyprus tax authorities have the power to adjust the taxable profits and deem additional income to reflect arm's-length prices. Compensating deductions may apply in certain cases.
The Cyprus tax authorities have communicated that the transfer of shares of companies within a group at a value different than the market value should not have any adverse Cyprus tax implications in certain circumstances.
With effect from 1 January 2022, transfer pricing documentation requirements have been introduced. The transfer pricing documentation compliance obligations include the preparation of Master File, Cyprus Local File, Summary Table, and Minimum Transfer Pricing Documentation for Cyprus tax resident persons and PEs of non-Cyprus tax resident persons situated in Cyprus that engage in transactions with related parties. A formal Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) procedure has also been introduced. Specific penalties for non-compliance with the new obligations are now in place.
### Transfer Pricing Documentation File
As of 1 January 2022 onwards, Cyprus tax resident persons and PEs of non-Cyprus tax resident persons situated in Cyprus that engage in domestic and/or cross-border controlled transactions, subject to exemptions mentioned below, are required to prepare, on an annual basis, a Transfer Pricing Documentation File, which consists of the 'Master File' and the 'Cyprus Local File'.
#### Contents
The required contents of the Master File and Cyprus Local File closely follow the definition and suggested contents of Master File and Local File as per the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (and BEPS Action 13 Report).
#### Exemptions
The following exemptions apply:
are exempt from the obligation to prepare a Cyprus Local File.
#### Quality Review
A person who holds a Practicing Certificate from the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus (ICPAC) or another approved by the Council of Ministers body of certified auditors in Cyprus is expected to perform a Quality Review of the Cyprus Local File.
#### Format and language
The Transfer Pricing Documentation File should be maintained by the taxpayer in electronic or paper format and may be prepared in a generally acceptable language, preferably in English; however, the Cyprus Tax Department (CTD) may request its translation in Greek if necessary.
#### Relevant deadlines
The Transfer Pricing Documentation File (consisting of the Master File and Local File as applicable) must be prepared and be subject to Quality Review (if necessary) on an annual basis, by the deadline of filing the Income Tax Return for the relevant tax year.
The Transfer Pricing Documentation File needs to be retained in compliance with the general document retention obligations for tax purposes; however, it should be submitted to the CTD upon request by the CTD (e.g. for the purpose of tax audit) and specifically within 60 days from the date of such request. Penalties shall be imposed for late or non-filing (*as described below*).
#### Transfer Pricing Documentation File updates
The Transfer Pricing Documentation File must be updated on an annual basis and include details regarding the impact of market fluctuations or other events on the information and analyses included therein.
#### Summary Table
A Summary Table must be prepared by all taxpayers that engage in controlled transactions on an annual basis, disclosing details regarding each such transaction, including the names and tax identification codes of the related counterparties, the respective arm's-length values per transaction category (sale/purchase of goods, provision/receipt of services, financing transactions, receipt/payment of IP licences/royalties, others), whether transfer pricing documentation has been prepared, whether the Quality Review (where applicable) has been performed and by whom, and other related information. The Summary Table must be submitted electronically together with the Income Tax Return for the relevant tax year.
#### Minimum Transfer Pricing Documentation
##### Contents
##### Relevant deadlines
The Minimum Transfer Pricing Documentation should be submitted to the CTD upon request (within 60 days).
#### Simplification Measures for certain types of controlled transactions
Persons that are exempt from the obligation to prepare a Cyprus Local File for controlled transactions may elect to apply the Simplification Measures (safe harbour rates) for the pricing of the following types of controlled transactions:
1. Financing granted to related parties financed by borrowings.
2. Financing granted to related parties financed by equity.
3. Financing obtained from related parties to the extent it is used in the business.
4. LVAS (received or provided).
Furthermore, the Simplification Measures (safe harbour rates) cannot be applied if reliable internal comparables (i.e. comparable transactions with unrelated parties) can be used to determine the arm’s-length price of the controlled transactions.
| Transactions eligible for safe harbour rates | Safe harbour provision |
| --- | --- |
| Loans or cash advances to related parties that are funded out of financial means | Minimum return of 2.5% (after the deduction of allowable expenses) |
| Loans or cash advances receivable from related parties that are funded out of own capital | Minimum return should be equal to the yield rate (as at 31 December of the prior tax year) of the ten-year government bond of the country in which the borrower operates, increased by 3.5% |
| Loans payable to related parties to the extent that the funds obtained are used in the business | Cost of borrowing must not exceed the yield rate (as at 31 December of the prior tax year) of the ten-year government bond of Cyprus, increased by 1.5% |
| LVAS | 5% markup on the relevant costs |
### APA procedure
The Transfer Pricing Regulations also introduce a formal APA procedure. Specifically, Cyprus tax resident persons and non-Cyprus tax resident persons that have a PE situated in Cyprus may submit to the CTD an APA request with respect to current or future domestic or cross-border controlled transactions.
The APA may cover the various conditions and assumptions relevant for determining the arm’s-length pricing of the controlled transactions for a specified period, including:
The CTD examines the APA request and approves or rejects it.
#### Relevant timelines
The CTD should issue the APA within 10 months (this may be extended up to 24 months) from the date of submission of the APA request by the taxpayer.
The APA may be applicable for a maximum term of four years; however, it cannot apply for any tax year prior to the tax year in which the request is submitted.
#### Bilateral and multilateral APAs
The APA request for cross-border controlled transactions may be bilateral or multilateral, involving the tax authorities in other jurisdiction(s) with which Cyprus has concluded a DTT. In such cases, a corresponding request needs to be filed by the taxpayer with the authorities in the other jurisdiction(s), and the CTD may consult in writing with such authorities under the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP), for the purpose of issuing the APA.
#### Validity of APAs
The prices of the controlled transactions covered by an approved APA will be considered as arm’s length, provided that any conditions included in the APA are met and that the critical assumptions on which the APA was based continue to be valid and applicable.
An approved APA is considered binding; however, it can be revised, revoked, or cancelled under certain conditions.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
On 26 May 2017, the Cyprus Minister of Finance issued a Decree (replacing a Decree issued on 30 December 2016) introducing mandatory CbC reporting in line with the relevant amendment to the EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) in the Field of Taxation, known as DAC4, and the G20/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development BEPS Action 13 CbC reporting requirements for MNE groups generating consolidated annual turnover exceeding EUR 750 million.
Per the Decree, Cyprus tax resident constituent entities of an MNE group should notify the Cyprus tax authorities as to whether they are the reporting entity and, if they are not, the details of the MNE group’s reporting entity. Deadline for the submission of the CbC notification to the Cyprus tax authorities by the Cyprus constituent entities of the group is the last day of the fiscal year. For example, in the case where the group has a fiscal year end of 31 December 2020, the deadline for filing the Cyprus CbC notifications will be 31 December 2020.
In line with the relevant EU Directive and the OECD’s Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of CbC reports (MCAA), the Cyprus tax authorities will apply the automatic exchange of information mechanisms to exchange CbC reports filed by MNE groups in Cyprus with the tax authorities in other jurisdictions in which the MNE group operates.  Specifically, the reports will be exchanged with the tax authorities of the other EU member states in which the MNE group operates and all other jurisdictions that have signed the MCAA and have an activated exchange relationship with Cyprus or have concluded a bilateral agreement for the exchange of CbC reports with Cyprus.
## Interest limitation rule
As of 1 January 2019, an interest limitation rule applies in accordance with the ATAD.
### Scope
Cyprus, consistent with the options foreseen by the ATAD, excluded from the scope of application of this rule:
Where a Cyprus CIT payer is a member of a Cyprus group, the interest limitation rule applies at the level of the Cyprus group; otherwise, it applies per company or per Cyprus PE. The Cyprus group for this rule has a 75% relationship condition and is referred to below as ‘the Cyprus group’.
### How the rule works
The interest limitation rule limits the otherwise deductible exceeding borrowing costs (EBCs) of the Cyprus CIT payer/Cyprus group to 30% of adjusted taxable profit (taxable EBITDA).
The interest limitation rule contains an annual EUR 3 million safe-harbour threshold. This means that EBCs up to and including EUR 3 million is in any case not restricted by this rule (the EUR 3 million threshold would apply in cases where ‘30% of taxable EBIDTA’ results to an amount below EUR 3 million). In the case of a Cyprus group, the EUR 3 million applies for the aggregate EBCs of the Cyprus group and not per taxpayer.
The taxable EBITDA is computed by adding back to the taxable profit of the year the EBCs, depreciation, amortisation, and deductions in relation to tangible/intangible fixed assets. The 80% Cyprus ‘IP box’ deduction on qualifying IP profits is added back to the taxable profit for the purposes of determining the taxable EBITDA.
EBCs are defined as the amount of tax-deductible borrowing costs in excess of the amount of taxable interest income/other taxable income economically equivalent to interest.
The term ‘borrowing costs’ is broadly defined and covers interest expenses on all forms of debt, other costs economically equivalent to interest expenses, as well as expenses incurred in connection with the raising of finance including, for example, payments under profit participating loans, financing related hedging costs, and guarantee fees. Consistent with the OECD BEPS Action 4, from which the interest limitation rule derives, the annual Cyprus NID, which is calculated on new equity (introduced in Cyprus with effect from 1 January 2015), is not considered as ‘borrowing costs’ for the purposes of this rule.
The interest limitation rule applies to EBCs irrespective of whether the financing is with related parties or third parties.
### Specific exclusions
#### Grandfathering of loans concluded before 17 June 2016
When determining the amount of deductible EBCs that may be limited under this rule, the EBCs of loans concluded before 17 June 2016 are excluded and remain deductible. This exclusion shall not extend to any subsequent modification of such loans.
#### Long-term infrastructure projects
When determining the amount of deductible EBCs that may be limited under this rule, the EBCs arising from loans used to finance long-term infrastructure projects in those cases where the project operator, borrowing costs, assets, and income are all in the European Union are excluded and remain deductible.
The corresponding taxable profit from such long-term infrastructure projects is excluded from the taxable EBITDA.
#### Group equity escape
There is an annual election for a group equity escape, which is based on the level of equity of the Cyprus CIT payer/Cyprus group as compared to the level of equity within the Cyprus CIT payer’s/Cyprus group’s consolidated group for financial reporting purposes (on a worldwide basis). In cases where the ratio of ‘equity/total assets’ is higher at the level of the Cyprus CIT payer/Cyprus group (or even up to 2% lower) as compared to its consolidated group for financial reporting purposes (on a worldwide basis), the interest limitation rule, in effect, does not apply for that tax year.
### Carry forward
The interest limitation rule also contains carry forward provisions. EBCs not deductible in a tax year due to the application of this rule may be carried forward to future tax years for up to five years. This five-year carry forward is in line with Cyprus’ five-year income tax loss carry forward rule.
Additionally unused interest capacity (i.e. where the amount of 30% of taxable EBITDA is in excess of the EBCs for a tax year) that has not been utilised within a tax year may be carried forward for use for the next five tax years.
The above carry forward provisions are subject to an anti-abuse rule in certain cases of change in ownership of the company.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
A CFC is a low-taxed non-Cyprus tax resident company in which the Cyprus CIT payer, alone or together with its associated enterprises, holds a direct or indirect interest of more than 50%.
A CFC is also a low-taxed foreign PE of a Cyprus tax resident company that is exempt from tax in Cyprus (exempt foreign PE).
A non-Cyprus tax resident company (or an exempt foreign PE) is considered as low-taxed if the actual foreign corporate tax paid by it on its profits is lower than 50% of the corporate income tax charge that would have been payable in Cyprus under the Cyprus CIT rules had it been a Cyprus tax resident company.
### Exceptions
The CFC rule does not apply to non-Cyprus tax resident companies (or exempt foreign PEs):
### Targeted income
Cyprus has opted for the Model B approach as foreseen in the ATAD.
When a non-Cyprus tax resident company (or an exempt foreign PE) meets the definition criteria of CFC (*refer to Scope above*), the Cyprus CIT payer must include in its taxable profit the non-distributed income of the CFC to the extent such income arises from non-genuine arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage (*refer to Non-genuine arrangement test below*).
Non-distributed income of the CFC is defined as the after tax accounting profit of the CFC, which has not been distributed to the Cyprus CIT payer during the Cyprus tax year in which the CFC profits are included (*refer to Inclusion rules below*) or within the next seven months.
### Non-genuine arrangement test
An arrangement or series thereof shall be regarded as non-genuine to the extent that the CFC would not own the assets or would not have undertaken the risks that generate all, or part of, its income if it were not controlled by the Cyprus CIT payer where the significant people functions (SPFs) that are relevant to those assets and risks are carried out and are instrumental in generating the CFC’s income.
### Inclusion rules
The non-distributed income of the CFC included in the taxable profit of the Cyprus CIT payer shall be limited to amounts generated through assets and risks that are linked to the SPFs in the Cyprus CIT payer and is calculated based on arm’s-length principles. Further, this amount shall not exceed the amount of the non-distributed income of the CFC (grossed-up for the CFC’s foreign corporate tax paid) that resulted from assets and risks associated with the SPFs carried out by the Cyprus CIT payer.
The same provisions apply in those cases where the CFC generates losses instead of profits.
The CFC income or loss, depending on the case, to be included in the taxable profit of the Cyprus CIT payer is calculated based on the Cyprus CIT payers’ percentage of entitlement of the CFC’s profits. The CFC income or loss must be included in the Cyprus tax period in which the tax year of the CFC ends. Upon inclusion, such income or loss shall be subject to the normal Cyprus CIT rules.
### Avoidance of double taxation on CFC income
Cyprus shall grant a tax credit against the Cyprus CIT payable for certain taxes paid abroad on the CFC income.
Additionally, rules have been put in place to prevent double taxation in Cyprus in cases where income that has previously been included in Cyprus under the CFC rule is subsequently actually distributed or realised through a disposal of investment.
## General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR)
The Cyprus ATAD first implementation law includes the ATAD GAAR. This requires (for the purposes of calculating the Cyprus CIT liability of the Cyprus CIT payer) an arrangement or a series of arrangements to be ignored where these, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances.
An arrangement or a series thereof shall be regarded as non-genuine to the extent that they are not put into place for valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality.

# Cyprus
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Foreign tax
## The Cyprus holding company
Exemptions for:
together with the fact that Cyprus does not withhold taxes on payments abroad (except on certain payments to companies in jurisdictions included on the EU blacklist) of dividend, interest, and royalty (unless right is used in Cyprus) and its extensive DTT network, as well as full adoption and access to all EU Directives, make Cyprus an ideal 'holding company' EU jurisdiction.
## The Cyprus financing company
The low headline CIT rate of 12.5% imposed on interest incomes, coupled with other tax law provisions, make Cyprus a very competitive 'financing company' EU jurisdiction.
## Notional interest deduction (NID) on corporate equity
Equity introduced to a Cyprus tax resident company post 31 December 2014 (‘new equity’) in the form of paid-up share capital or share premium may be eligible for an annual NID for tax purposes, calculated as new equity x NID interest rate. New equity may be settled in cash or with assets contributed in kind. The NID is also applicable to Cyprus PEs of non-Cyprus tax resident companies.
NID calculated on new equity is deductible for tax purposes in a similar manner as for actual interest expense (*see the [Deductions](deductions.html) section for more information*); the NID cannot, however, exceed 80% of the taxable profit generated by the activities financed by the new equity (as calculated prior to the NID). Any NID deduction that is restricted due to the cap of 80% is not available to be utilised by way of carryforward to future tax years or otherwise. A taxpayer may elect not to claim all or part of the available NID for a particular tax year.
In relation to the NID interest rate:
In order to tackle possible abuse of the NID, the NID provisions include specific anti-avoidance provisions and a general anti-avoidance provision for non-commercial transactions.
## Intellectual property (IP) box
The CIT IP box provisions have been aligned with the conclusions of the OECD BEPS Action 5 report on the (modified) nexus approach. The new Cyprus IP box applies with retrospective effect from 1 July 2016, and the initial ('old') Cyprus IP box was closed on 30 June 2016 and was subject to transitional/grandfathering rules up to 30 June 2021.
### New Cyprus IP box
The new Cyprus IP box allows for a deductible notional expense calculated as 80% x qualifying profits from qualifying IP.
For the purposes of the 80% deduction, qualifying IP may be legally or economically owned and comprise:
Marketing-related IP, such as trademarks, do not qualify.
Qualifying profits include, *inter alia*:
In calculating the amount of the qualifying IP profits entitled to the 80% deduction, a fraction is applied to the above IP profits based on R&D activity of the taxpayer; the higher the amount of R&D undertaken by the taxpayer itself (or via a taxable foreign PE or via unrelated third party outsourcing), the higher the amount of R&D fraction (modified nexus fraction).
## Exemption from CGT on acquired Cyprus immovable property
Land and land with buildings acquired at market value (excluding exchanges, donations, and foreclosures) from unrelated parties in the period 16 July 2015 to 31 December 2016 will be exempt from CGT upon their future disposal.
## The Cyprus Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS)
Law 124(I)/2018 (hereinafter, the ‘AIF Law’) defines alternative investment funds as any collective investment undertakings, including investment compartments thereof, which, collectively:
The AIF Law allows for three types of AIFs to be registered in Cyprus:
The various legal forms in which either type of AIFs can undertake are as follows:
### **AIF/RAIF:**
### AIFLNP:
### UCITS:
The UCI Law defines UCITS as undertakings the sole object of which is the collective investment in transferable securities and/or other liquid financial instruments as referred to in section 40 (1) of the UCI Law, of capital raised from the public, which operate on the principle of risk-spreading, and the units of which are, at the request of investors, redeemed or repurchased, directly or indirectly, out of these undertakings’ assets.
UCITS can take the following legal forms:
## Taxation of funds
Funds that are opaque for tax purposes and managed and controlled in Cyprus are tax resident in Cyprus and are subject to the general provisions of the Cyprus tax framework.
In the case of funds that have compartments, each compartment is assessed separately for tax purposes, subject to the provisions of the law.
Under circumstances and depending on the legal form of the fund, some funds may be transparent for tax purposes.
Additional key provisions that are relevant to funds are set out below:
### Sale of fund units
There is no CGT on the gains arising from the disposal or redemption of units in a fund unless the fund owns, directly or indirectly, any immovable property situated in Cyprus (subject to conditions).
However, even if the fund owns immovable property situated in Cyprus, no CGT arises if the fund is listed on a recognised stock exchange.
### Stamp duty
The subscription, redemption, conversion, or transfer of a fund’s units should be exempt from Cyprus stamp duty.
### No creation of a permanent establishment (PE)
Based on the Cyprus tax legislation, no PE will be deemed to arise in Cyprus in cases of:
### Collective management services
The management fee charged for the provision of collective management services to investment funds is exempted from VAT, provided certain conditions are met.
## Audiovisual industry incentives
### Audiovisual tax exemption
Profits of corporate persons from the production of films, series, and other related audiovisual programs in Cyprus are exempt from CIT.
The audiovisual tax exemption shall not exceed 35% of the eligible production expenditure incurred in Cyprus. The amount of audiovisual tax exemption, subject to certain criteria and conditions, shall not exceed 50% of the corporate person’s taxable income from the production.
The audiovisual tax exemption, to the extent that it is not granted due to the above percentage limitation, will be carried forward and be granted within the next five years, subject to the above percentage limitation.
### Investments in audiovisual infrastructure and technological equipment
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) investing in audiovisual infrastructure and technological equipment related to the audiovisual industry are entitled, subject to certain criteria and conditions, to deduct from their taxable income the value of such investment in the year the amount was invested.
The maximum tax deduction is 20% of the eligible infrastructure and technological equipment expenditures for a small enterprise and 10% for a medium enterprise.
The tax deduction, to the extent that it is not granted due to the above percentage limitation, will be carried forward and be granted within the next five years, subject to the above percentage limitation.
The investment in technological equipment related to the audiovisual industry needs to remain in Cyprus for at least five years.
## Investments in approved innovative enterprises
As of 26 July 2022, legal persons providing risk finance investments in innovative SMEs (as defined in the IT Law), either directly or indirectly, via multilateral trading facilities or investment funds, subject to certain conditions and limitations, will be granted a deduction for amounts invested each year in approved innovative SMEs.
The deduction is capped at 50% of the taxable income in the year of investment as calculated prior to claiming this deduction, subject to a maximum deduction of EUR 150,000 per tax year. Unused deduction can be carried forward and claimed in the following five years, subject to the caps mentioned.
In cases where an investment in an innovative SME is made by a legal person that is an independent investor, to the extent the investment is financed from own funds, the deduction is limited to 30% of the amount invested.
The deduction is currently available up to 31 December 2026.

## Business combinations
Transfers of assets and liabilities between companies can occur without tax implications within the framework of a tax-exempt qualified reorganisation. Reorganisations include mergers, demergers, partial divisions, transfers of divisions of activities, exchanges of shares, and transfers of registered office of a European company (SE) or a European cooperative company (SCE).
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) and cooperation
Alongside DTTs, Cyprus is a signatory to the OECD/Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and is an early adopter of the CRS on automatic exchange of information. Cyprus has also signed a Model 1 IGA with the United States (US) for the US Financial Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) initiative on automatic exchange of information.
Cyprus is a member of the *ad-hoc* group for the multilateral instrument implementing BEPS tax treaty measures. In November 2016, the group adopted the BEPS Action 15 ‘Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion', which was signed on 7 June 2017.
Cyprus, as a member state of the European Union, incorporates all EU Directives in its domestic Laws.
Cyprus is in cooperation with the European Commission (EC) regarding the EC’s recent focus into fiscal state aid and tax rulings. To date, the European Commission has not raised any specific investigations regarding Cyprus.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
Cyprus is expanding and updating its double tax treaty (DTT) network. A first-time Cyprus-Netherlands DTT entered into force as of 30 June 2023 and is effective as of 1 January 2024. A first-time Cyprus-Croatia DTT was signed and entered into force in 2023 and is effective as of 1 January 2024. A revised Cyprus-France DTT was signed on 11 December 2023 and is now awaiting ratification before it becomes effective.
Cyprus is an early adopter of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) on automatic exchange of financial account information and also has signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States (US) for the Financial Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
Cyprus signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures (MLI) to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) on 7 June 2017. Subsequently, Cyprus ratified the MLI on 23 January 2020. The date of 'entry into effect' as regards Cyprus’ application of the MLI for any particular bilateral DTT covered by the MLI depends upon various possible legal processes/options by the other contracting party jurisdiction.
Over the last four years Cyprus has also successfully transposed into its legal and tax framework all European Union (EU) Directives on Administrative Co-operation and Mutual Assistance (i.e. DACs 1-5). Furthermore, on 30 March 2021, the law transposing the DAC6 Directive entered into force with retroactive effect covering transactions from 25 June 2018 and onwards.
As of 1 January 2022, new personal income tax (PIT) exemptions have been introduced for first employments exercised in Cyprus, and on 30 June 2023 further amendments were implemented. More specifically, a new 50% exemption applies as of 1 January 2022 for remuneration of 'first employment' exercised in Cyprus commencing as of 1 January 2022 with remuneration exceeding 55,000 euros (EUR) *per annum*, subject to certain conditions. Individuals whose employment commenced prior to 1 January 2022 may also be eligible to transition into the new 50% exemption. Additionally, a new 20% exemption applies as of 26 July 2022 for first employments exercised in Cyprus commencing as of that date, subject to certain conditions. *See Exempt income in the*[*Income determination*](income-determination.html) *section* for more information.
Τhe tax incentives relating to investments in innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been extended to 31 December 2026.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Employment income
Employees are taxed on all remuneration, including bonuses and certain employment benefits in kind. A number of important exemptions are available (*see Exempt income below*).
Employees are not taxed on reimbursements for business travel and business entertainment expenses.
## Self-employed income/Business income
Profits from a permanent establishment (PE) abroad are exempt from PIT, subject to anti-avoidance rules set out below.
The foreign PE exemption is applicable, unless the below anti-avoidance rule applies:
Losses from an ‘exempt foreign PE’ are eligible to be offset with other income subject to PIT. In such a case, future profits of an ‘exempt foreign PE’ become taxable in Cyprus up to the amount of losses previously allowed.
With effect from 1 July 2016, taxpayers may irrevocably elect to be subject to PIT on foreign PE profits. In such a case, credit in Cyprus will be available for foreign taxes paid on the foreign PE profits. Transitional rules may be applicable to such a credit where a foreign PE was previously exempt from taxation in Cyprus and subsequently a taxpayer elects to be subject to PIT on foreign PE profits.
## Carried interest / Performance fee for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) fund managers
Certain employees and executives of investment fund management companies or internally managed investment funds may opt for a different mode of personal taxation:
Subject to conditions, their variable employment remuneration, which is effectively connected to the carried interest of the fund managing entity, may be subject to Cyprus tax at the flat rate of 8%, with a minimum tax liability of EUR 10,000 *per annum*. This special mode of taxation is available for a period of ten years in total, subject to the annual election of the individual, and is not added to any other income.
## Capital gains
## Dividend and interest income
Dividend and (most types of) interest income received by individuals are exempt from PIT but are subject to SDC, which is imposed at flat rates of 17% on dividend income and 17% on interest income (except for corporate and Cyprus government bonds where 3% rate applies).
We note that, as of 16 July 2015, individuals are subject to SDC only in those cases where they are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for SDC purposes.
## Rental income
Gross rental income (without deductions) is also subject to SDC at an effective rate of 2.25%. However, on 13 September 2023, the CTA issued a Circular pursuant of which rental income from self-catering accommodation that is rented out via online platforms will be treated, subject to certain conditions, as business income (therefore, subject to PIT and exempt from SDC).
We note that, as of 16 July 2015, individuals are subject to SDC only in those cases where they are both Cyprus tax resident and Cyprus domiciled for SDC purposes.
## Exempt income
The following types of personal income are exempt from tax in Cyprus:

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
As of 2017, an individual is a tax resident of Cyprus if one satisfies either the '183-day rule' or the '60-day rule' for the tax year. For earlier tax years only, the '183-day rule' is relevant for determining Cyprus tax residency.
The '183-day rule' for Cyprus tax residency is satisfied for individuals who spend more than 183 days in any one calendar year in Cyprus, without any further additional conditions/criteria being relevant.
The '60-day rule' for Cyprus tax residency is satisfied for individuals who, cumulatively, in the relevant tax year:
To satisfy the fourth criteria, the individual must carry out any business in Cyprus and/or be employed in Cyprus and/or hold an office (director) of a company tax resident in Cyprus at any time in the tax year, provided that such is not terminated during the tax year. Further, the individual must maintain in the tax year a permanent residential property in Cyprus that is either owned or rented by the individual.
For the purposes of both the '183-day rule' and the '60-day rule', days in and out of Cyprus are calculated as follows:
