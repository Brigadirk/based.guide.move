# Netherlands - Corporate - Taxes on Corporate Income

## Overview
In general, a Dutch resident company is subject to Corporate Income Tax (CIT) on its worldwide income. However, certain income can be exempted or excluded from the tax base. Non-resident entities only have a limited tax liability with regard to income from Dutch sources.

## Standard Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Rate
The standard CIT rate is 25.8%. There are two taxable income brackets. A lower rate of 19% applies to the first income bracket of EUR 200,000. The standard rate applies to the excess of the taxable income.

## Fiscal Investment Fund Regime
Under the fiscal investment fund regime, the CIT rate for fiscal investment funds is 0%, provided that their profit is made available to the shareholders and holders of certificates of participation no later than eight months after year-end. As of 1 January 2025, fiscal investment funds are no longer able to invest directly in Dutch real estate, ensuring profits from Dutch real estate are taxed under CIT.

## Exempt Investment Fund Regime
The exempt investment fund regime exists alongside the fiscal investment fund regime. To be eligible, the investment fund must fulfil the definition of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, limiting investments to financial instruments traded on qualifying stock markets. From 1 January 2025, access to this regime is only open to regulated institutions.

## Innovation Box Regime
The innovation box regime offers a reduced tax rate on profits from self-developed intangible assets. Entry tickets include possession of an R&D certificate or a legal access ticket like a patent. Smaller companies only need to meet the first entry ticket, while larger companies must meet both. The regime requires detailed tracking and tracing of R&D expenditures and benefits.

## Tonnage Tax Regime
The tonnage tax regime is a favourable tax regime for shipping companies, where taxable profit is based on the net tonnage of the vessel rather than actual profits. The regime applies to qualifying shipping activities and is available upon request for a fixed period of ten years or multiples thereof.

## Local Income Taxes
There are no provincial or municipal corporate income taxes in the Netherlands.

# Netherlands - Corporate - Tax Administration

## Taxable Period
The tax year is generally equal to the calendar year, but corporate taxpayers may adopt a different financial year.

## Tax Returns
Corporate taxpayers must file a tax return annually, generally due five months after the end of the financial year. Provisional assessments can be issued, and final assessments must be issued within three years following the financial year.

## Functional Foreign Currency Regime
Under certain conditions, corporate taxpayers can file tax returns in a currency other than euros. The taxable amount is converted into euros using the average exchange rate during the financial year.

## Payment of Tax
Corporate taxpayers must pay CIT within six weeks of the assessment date. Interest is charged on late payments, and refunds of unduly levied tax are made with interest.

## Tax Audit Process
Corporate taxpayers may be subject to audits by tax inspectors, with a trend towards enhanced cooperation between tax authorities and taxpayers under horizontal monitoring.

## Statute of Limitations
Additional assessments can be imposed within five years for domestic situations and 12 years for income from abroad, provided new facts arise.

## Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) / Advance Tax Ruling (ATR)
Taxpayers can obtain certainty on their tax positions through APAs or ATRs. APAs provide certainty on transfer pricing, while ATRs cover the CIT implications of specific transactions.

## Horizontal Monitoring
The Netherlands employs a cooperative compliance program called horizontal monitoring, where the tax authorities adjust their monitoring based on the taxpayer's level of tax control.

## Anti-Abuse Provisions
The Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act contains several anti-abuse provisions to counter artificial arrangements, with substance requirements serving as an indication of non-abuse.

# Netherlands - Corporate - Withholding Taxes

## WHT on Dividends
Dividends from Dutch resident corporations are generally subject to a 15% Dutch dividend WHT. Certain exemptions apply, and anti-abuse rules are in place.

## Conditional WHT on Interest, Royalty, and Dividend Payments
The Netherlands applies a conditional WHT on payments to affiliated companies in low-tax jurisdictions or non-cooperative jurisdictions. The WHT rate is 25.8% for 2025, but this may be reduced by tax treaties.

## Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
The MLI allows countries to amend their tax treaties to combat tax avoidance. The Netherlands applies the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to prevent treaty abuse.

## Overview of WHT Rates for Domestic Corporations
Domestic corporations are required to withhold taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties at varying rates depending on the recipient and applicable tax treaties.

## Interest Income
Interest income is generally taxable, but certain exemptions and deductions apply.

## Foreign Income
Dutch resident companies are subject to CIT on worldwide income, but certain foreign income is exempt or excluded from the tax base. Double taxation is relieved through tax credits or exemptions.
