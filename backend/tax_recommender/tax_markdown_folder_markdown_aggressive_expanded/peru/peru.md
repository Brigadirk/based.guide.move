# Peru
## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Peru, located on South America's central Pacific coast, is bordered by Brazil and Bolivia to the east, Chile to the south, and Colombia and Ecuador to the north. Peru declared independence in 1821 and is divided into 25 regions, with Lima as its capital. The official language of Peru is Spanish, and the currency is the sol (PEN).
Peru is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), with several bilateral agreements based on most favoured nation treatment on a reciprocal basis. In recent years, Peru’s foreign trade policy has promoted an aggressive trade liberalisation to successfully insert Peru in the global economy. To that end, Peru has signed several trade agreements that aim to further access to the country’s main trading partners, including the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador), Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela), Pacific Alliance (Colombia, Chile, and Mexico), EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), the European Union (EU), Australia, Chile, China, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States (US), and Venezuela.
Peru has also signed trade agreements soon to be effective with Guatemala, Hong Kong and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). It is currently negotiating agreements with El Salvador, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua and Turkey, the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and the Doha Development Round.
