## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Tax returns
Income tax returns must be generally filed between the last week of May and the first week of June, according to the last number of each taxpayer ID. Late filing is subject to fines; late payment is subject to moratorium interest; lack of payment is subject to a mandatory collection procedure.
## Payment of tax
Income tax on remuneration must be withheld by the employer. It must be paid on account on a monthly basis. If only employment income is obtained, individuals are not required to file a tax return.
