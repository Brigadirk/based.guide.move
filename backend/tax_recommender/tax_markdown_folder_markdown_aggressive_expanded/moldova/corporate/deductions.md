## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
The threshold value of fixed assets recognised for tax purposes is established to MDL 12,000.
For entities that apply the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the calculation and deduction of depreciation related to the right to use fixed assets that are the subject of an operational leasing contract is performed by the lessee.
As of 2025, all legal entities, except for legal entities that carry out financial insurance/reinsurance activities provided for in section К of the Activities classifier in the Moldovan economy have the right to apply the accelerated depreciation method for the first year of putting the fixed asset into operation.
The amount of amortisation of the fixed asset to be deducted is determined as follows:
Intangible assets are subject to CIT amortisation according to the straight-line method.
## Goodwill
According to the National Accounting Standards, goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset. However, the Moldovan Tax Code does not expressly provide for specific rules regarding CIT deduction.
## Start-up expenses
According to the National Accounting Standards, start-up expenses incurred by companies (e.g. stamp taxes paid upon company registration, drawing up of registration documents, manufacture of stamp) are not recognised as an intangible asset. Therefore, such expenses are to be treated as current expenses.
## Interest expenses
Different CIT deductibility rules apply for interest on loans used for carrying out operational activities and for loans used for investment activities performed on an occasional basis.
As a general rule, deductions for interest expenses are allowed for CIT purposes, provided such expenses are deemed as ordinary and necessary for carrying out the activities of the business. Expenses should also be incurred for the purposes of obtaining taxable income and justified by adequate backup documentation.
If the interest paid by a Moldovan company relates to its operational or day-to-day activities, the related expenses are deductible for CIT purposes, taking into account the following:
If interest relates to an investment activity, the interest expense is deductible for CIT purposes within the limit of the income derived from the investment.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible for CIT purposes, provided certain conditions are fulfilled and justifying documents are made available.
Starting 01 January 2025,  the threshold of bad debt with an expired statute of limitations has been increased from MDL 1,000 to MDL 2,000.
The deduction of bad debts up to MDL 2,000, for which the statute of limitation has exceeded three years, is allowed.
## Charitable contributions
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties related to CIT, related to other taxes and due payments to the state budget, or for violations of legal acts are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
CIT is not deductible for CIT purposes.
Other taxes are generally deductible for CIT purposes, except those paid on behalf of another person.
## Other significant items
Among others, the following expenses are also generally deductible for CIT purposes:
Starting with 1 January 2024, the following additional deductions are allowed:
### Non-deductible expenses
Among others, the following expenses are generally not deductible for CIT purposes:
## Fiscal losses
Fiscal losses may only be carried forward for five consecutive years following the year the losses were incurred, provided the company records taxable income. If the company recorded fiscal losses for more than one year, such losses are carried forward in the order in which they arose. Fiscal losses are recorded on off-balance-sheet accounts.
Losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Moldovan legal entity generally may deduct expenses related to payments to foreign affiliates to the extent that these amounts were actually paid and are not in excess of what it would have paid to an unrelated entity (i.e. arm’s length). However, the payer is required to hold documentary evidence for the actually performed transactions. Certain types of expenses may follow general rules of deductibility that would limit their amount (e.g. interest expenses on loan agreements).
