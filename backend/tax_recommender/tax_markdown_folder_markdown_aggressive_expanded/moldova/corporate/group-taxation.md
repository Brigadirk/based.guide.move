## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
### General rules on transactions with related parties
With reference to the transactions carried out by Moldovan companies with related parties, Moldovan tax law provides the following specific provisions:
In accordance with Moldovan tax law, a company is considered the taxpayer’s related party if one of the following conditions exists:
From a tax perspective, control is the ownership (either directly or through one or more related parties) of 50% or more in value of the capital or voting power of one of the companies. For this purpose, an individual will be treated as owning all equity interest that is directly or indirectly owned by members of their family.
### Transfer pricing rules
The Republic of Moldova recently formally introduced its first transfer pricing regulations, which follow the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
Law no. 356, dated 29 December 2022, introduced the transfer pricing concept into the Moldovan Tax Code along with general rules related to transfer pricing reporting and documentation requirements.
The legislation enters into force on 1 January 2024. Further, on 09 February 2024, the Moldovan Authorities  approved the secondary legislation, containing guidance on the contents of the transfer pricing documentation and details regarding the application of the law.
Multinational enterprises operating in Moldova and Moldova-headquartered groups (limited only to transactions between resident taxpayers, where one or both taxpayers are residents of free economic zones / information technology parks or they apply different rates and/or have different taxable bases for corporate income tax) should review their related-party transactions and documentation in view of compliance with the arm’s-length principle and further transfer pricing documentation requirements. Where appropriate, such groups should consider adjusting their operational and pricing models in seeking to avoid potential transfer pricing disputes with the Moldovan tax authorities and related sanctions due to non-compliance with the new regulations.
### Materiality thresholds and other legal requirements
The Moldovan government has set two materiality thresholds to be considered with regard to taxpayers that fall under transfer pricing requirements:
### Documentation requirements
A Moldovan taxpayer must prepare two types of documents for transfer pricing purposes:
### Penalties
According to the new legislation, the following penalties will apply:
As of 1 January 2025, the concept of ‘advance price agreement’ will come into force. A decision issued by the Moldovan Tax Authorities will establish and justify the conditions and the methods of formation of transfer prices during a determined period related to a controlled transaction or transactions carried out between related parties.
## Thin capitalisation
Moldovan tax law does not provide for a specific thin capitalisation regime.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Moldovan tax law does not contain CFC provisions.
