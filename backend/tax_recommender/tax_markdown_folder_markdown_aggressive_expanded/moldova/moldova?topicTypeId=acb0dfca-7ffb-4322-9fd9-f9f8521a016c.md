## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Resident legal entities are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-resident entities are taxed on their Moldovan-sourced income. Taxable income is computed as accounting profit adjusted in accordance with tax legislation.
## Inventory valuation
Under the National Accounting Standards, the following inventory valuation methods are mandatory: specific identification, first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), and weighted average cost.
Assets are generally valued at their acquisition cost, production cost, or market value.
## Capital gains
Transactions with capital assets performed by the companies are subject to general taxation rules.
## Dividend income
Starting 1 January 2021, dividends paid by Moldovan legal entities to other Moldovan legal entities from profit earned since 2012 do not represent taxable income.
Dividends are generally subject to a 6% WHT, except for those distributed from profits earned between 2008 and 2011, which are subject to a final WHT of 15%.
Dividends received by Moldovan legal entities from foreign legal entities are included in taxable income and taxed according to general established rules. According to Moldovan legislation, the beneficiary of such dividends is entitled to a credit for the tax paid in the foreign country, within certain limits.
## Interest income
In general, the interest income derived by legal entities is included in the total taxable amount and taxed at the applicable 12% CIT rate.

## Foreign income
Resident legal entities are taxed on their worldwide income. The legal entities, under certain conditions, can benefit from tax credits provided under a double tax treaty (DTT) or can apply for unilateral tax credits against income tax paid in any foreign country if this income is subject to taxation in Moldova. Such tax credit shall not exceed the amount that would have been estimated at the CIT rate applicable in the given tax period. Otherwise, there is no specific tax deferral regime.
