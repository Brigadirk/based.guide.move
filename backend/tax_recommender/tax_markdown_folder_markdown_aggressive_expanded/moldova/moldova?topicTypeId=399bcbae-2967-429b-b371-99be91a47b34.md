## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate in Moldova is currently 20%. It is generally applied to local supplies of goods and services, as well as to import of goods and services through a reverse-charge mechanism.
Apart from the above, certain types of supplies are subject to reduced VAT rates. For instance, local supplies of bread and bakery products; milk and dairy products; transport and distribution of natural gases services; biofuels used for electricity, heating, and hot water production; and specific phytotechnical, horticultural, and zootechnical products are subject to the reduced 8% VAT rate.
The VAT rate for hotels, restaurants, and cafes decreased from 12% to 8% as of 10 August 2023.
As of 1 October 2021, during the national state of emergency, as declared by Parliament in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 212/2004 on the state of emergency, siege and war regime, and during the national public health state of emergency, as declared by the extraordinary national commission of public health, the VAT rate for above-mentioned activities was set at 6%.
Starting 15 April 2022, the e-book production and/or audio and electronic periodicals publications and/or audio, as well as editing services, services regarding copyright, and related rights, are VAT-exempted supply without deduction right.
The reverse-charge mechanism applies for supply of goods by insolvent economic operators. Thus, buyers are required to calculate and pay to the state budget the related VAT amounts on purchased goods.
The reverse-charge mechanism for VAT on imports of services has been implemented, so VAT payers are not required to pay VAT on such imports. The VAT amounts related to these transactions will be reflected as output VAT, and input VAT will be allowed for deduction. Non-VAT payers will be required to declare and pay VAT on the import of services.
Foreign supplies of digital services to Moldova-based individuals (B2C transactions) are taxed with a 20% VAT in Moldova. Subject to VAT are the non-resident companies performing business activity without having legal presence in Moldova:
A number of supplies are VAT-exempt with deduction right, including international transportation and exports of goods or services. Certain supplies are VAT-exempt without deduction right.
Starting from 1 March 2024, providers of crowdfunding services are VAT-exempted without the right of deduction.
As of 15 August 2024, the settlement of additional costs or revenues from balancing the system, according to point 707 of the Electricity Market Rules, approved by the National Agency for Energy Regulation, will not constitute objects of taxation with VAT.
### Input VAT
Input VAT incurred on acquisitions of goods and/or services may be deducted, provided it is incurred by a VAT-registered payer to perform VATable supplies within its business activity.
If input VAT relates to acquisitions destined to perform mixed supplies (i.e. both VATable and VAT-exempt ones), the input VAT deduction right is allowed on a pro-rata basis.
For cases where the monthly ratio determined between the exempted supplies without deduction right and total supplies is lower than 0.05, the VAT amount paid or to be paid related to mixed procurements is fully allowed for deduction. VAT amounts previously reflected as costs or expenses in the previous tax periods for mixed procurements are deducted in the last tax period if the annual pro rata ratio is lower than 0.05.
Starting 22 November 2023, taxpayers have the right to deduct the amount of VAT paid or to be paid on acquisitions, provided that they have available the tax receipt issued by the cash register and control equipment connected to the Automated Informational System ’Electronic Sales Monitoring‘ for purchases whose value on each receipt does not exceed MDL 2,000, including VAT, but not more than MDL 10,000 for a tax period, provided that they are paid by business payment card.
As of 01 January 2025:
### VAT refunds
Should a company register a deductible input VAT exceeding its output VAT, this balance can be partially refunded only if the company carries out a specific range of business activities (e.g. export supplies, international transportation services, production of bakery and dairy products, leasing activity). Otherwise, such VAT amount may be carried forward to the following months, offset against the company's future output VAT liabilities.
Additionally, VAT payers performing capital investments in Moldova may be entitled to refund the recoverable VAT related to these kinds of capital investments, provided such assets are used for product manufacturing, service supply, and execution of works.
Companies registered as VAT payers that register the transactions via the Automated Informational System (AIS) and/or issue tax receipts via cash machines with Electronic Sales Monitoring (ESM) have the right to refund VAT on purchased goods and services. The refund will be made for the excess amount of VAT on purchases (including VAT on imports) over the amount of VAT on supplies for transactions registered as of 1 January 2023.
The possibility to offset the VAT amounts allowed for refund against future obligations to the national public budget is also available, at the request of taxpayers not having debts to the national public budget.
### VAT administration
A company is required to register for VAT purposes if the total turnover within the last 12 consecutive months reached the threshold of MDL 1.2 million. Also, companies can follow voluntary registration for VAT purposes if they only intend to perform taxable supplies.
If the subject was previously registered as a VAT payer, the period of holding the status of VAT payer is not considered when assessing the registration threshold.
All VAT payers registered for VAT purposes must submit electronic tax returns. VAT liabilities must be declared and settled monthly no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
Non-resident legal entities providing services through electronic networks to Moldovan resident individuals or through which payment for services is made are required to follow a simplified registration procedure within the electronic system of the State Tax Service. Subsequently, they are required to calculate, report, and pay the related VAT amounts by the 25th day of the month following each quarter.
Generally, taxpayers are required to issue VAT invoices for the performed supplies, as well as to keep detailed records of their acquisitions and supplies in the correspondent VAT ledgers, according to a set of specific rules.
Starting 1 January 2021, the taxpayers performing supplies within public acquisitions are required to issue electronic tax invoices (except for the supplies of electricity, heat, natural gas, electronic communications services, and utilities).
In the case of deliveries of goods paid for using business payment cards, when using e-invoices, the deadline for the supplier to issue a tax invoice is the tenth calendar day of the month following that in which the delivery took place.
## Customs duties
Moldova’s current customs framework is regulated by the Customs Code, Law on Customs Tariff, international agreements concluded by Moldova to date, and by other legal acts.
The new Custom Code entered into force 1 January 2024.
Customs duties include customs procedural taxes, customs taxes, VAT, and excise duties.
### Customs regimes
The new Customs Code outlines the following regimes for placing goods:
### Customs valuation
Under Moldovan customs legislation, the customs valuation is conducted in accordance with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The customs value is determined based on one of the six provided valuation methods: transaction value, transaction value of identical goods or similar goods, unit price method, the calculated value of goods. If the first method is not applicable, then the second method should be applied and so forth.
### Preferential tariff treatment
Moldova has free trade arrangements (FTAs) with the most of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and is also a contracting state of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and is party to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), as well as party to EU-Moldova Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). Under these agreements, preferential tariff treatment is granted for specific categories of goods, depending on their origin and in accordance with the FTAs to which Moldova is a party.
Also, further to the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), the customs duties on goods originating in the other party are eliminated. The origin of goods can be certified by an EUR.1 movement certificate or an origin declaration.
Customs duties applicable on imports performed in the Republic of Moldova are eliminated, except for products free of customs duties within the limits of the tariff quotas. In case these limits are exceeded, the most-favoured-nation customs duty rate shall apply.
Customs duties applicable on imports performed from the EU are eliminated, except for the following products:
Elimination of the customs duties on some specific categories of goods will be gradually made.
### Favourable tariff treatment
A favourable tariff treatment presumes a reduction or an exemption from customs duty upon import of specific goods into Moldova, depending on their type or final destination. This is governed by domestic customs law or international agreements to which Moldova is a party.
### Customs administration
Moldovan customs legislation provides for:
The Customs Service of Moldova uses procedures for issuing binding tariff and binding origin information. Additionally, companies may use the electronic procedure of customs clearance for the export of goods, as well as specific simplified customs procedures.
## Excise duties
Excise duties apply to the production and import of cars, tobacco, alcohol, petrol and lubricants, and other goods. Special excise rates for each type of excisable goods are established in the Tax Code. The rates are widely variable and are based on multiple factors. The excise duty rates are generally established as a percentage applied to the value of goods or as a fixed amount for a certain quantity of excisable goods. However, for specific types of excisable duties, mixed excise duty rates are applicable.
The following are subject to excise duties, unless there is a specific exemption provided:
Under certain circumstances, excise duty exemptions may apply. Some excise-liable goods are subject to mandatory excise stamp marking and labelling.
The deadline for payment of excise duties for excisable goods placed in tax warehouse is the 25th day of the month following the dispatch of excisable goods from the tax warehouse.
As of 2025, excise duties will not be levied on fur clothing.
## Tax on immovable property
The maximum and specific tax rate for determining the real estate tax and land tax have been abolished.
The local council can increase the real estate tax by up to 300% for the following categories of real estate:
The specific tax rates for real estate / land tax are determined annually by the representative and deliberative authorities of the local government.
For legal entities and individuals registered as entrepreneurs, 25 September is the deadline for submitting the calculation and payment of the tax on real estate acquired before 31 August. For real estate acquired after that date, the deadline is 25 March of the tax period following the reporting one.
In the event of an owner change during the fiscal year, the previous owner may request recalculation of the real estate tax in proportion to the period in which they were subject to taxation.
## Transfer duties
Transfer duties may be applied for notary acts performed by authorised notaries and other persons empowered by law. Transfer duties are applicable to notary-authenticated acts such as sale-purchase agreements for  land; transfers of houses into private property; alienation agreements of houses, apartments, garages, and other constructions; authentication of mortgage agreements; and other evaluative contracts.
## Stamp duties
According to the law on state duty, stamp duty (state duty) is the amount charged by specifically authorised state bodies from individuals and legal entities for the exercise of certain actions or issuance of legal documents of interest to them.
Stamp duties may be applied for, but not limited to, the following:
## Payroll taxes
Salaries and other remunerations provided by an employer to its employees are subject to 12% personal income tax (PIT).
Also, there are available deductions, each resident taxpayer being allowed to claim annual allowances. In 2025, allowances are set at:

Notes
1. This allowance is granted only to Moldovan resident taxpayers whose annual taxable income (with some exceptions) does not exceed MDL 360,000.
2. Individuals can opt for this allowance only provided certain conditions are fulfilled.
3. Individuals may opt for this allowance provided the spouse is eligible for the major personal allowance and does not use it in the period concerned.
All payroll taxes are reported through a unified payroll tax return by the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
## Social security contributions (SSC)
Starting 1 January 2021, new provisions regarding SSC are in force. Thus, mandatory SSC due by the employer and employee are combined into a single 24% rate (with some exceptions) and is fully borne by the employer. The rate of SSC is applied on employees' gross salary, meal tickets, and other recompense. For some specific sectors (public, aviation, agriculture), other rates are applicable.
As of 1 January 2023, the following changes became effective regarding the calculation of the SSC:
The legislation provides an annual fixed SSC for other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 20,518 applicable for 2025).
Companies report their SSC liabilities on a monthly basis (with certain exceptions) through the unique payroll tax return. The SSC due must be transferred by the employer to the budget no later than the 25th day of the month following the reporting one.
## Health insurance contributions
The mandatory health insurance contribution is computed as a percentage of wages and other remuneration and is established at 9% fully borne by the employee. The legislation also provides for an annual fixed amount of health insurance contribution paid by other categories of taxpayers in an amount approved for each year (e.g. MDL 12,636 applicable in 2025).
The mandatory health insurance contribution is declared on a monthly basis by the employer through the unique payroll tax return. The mandatory health insurance contribution due by employee must be transferred to the budget by the employer by the 25th day of the month following the moment of payment of salary and other remunerations.
## Environmental pollution payments

Road tax rates for the use of roads by vehicles registered in Moldova vary depending on the type of vehicle and its specific characteristics (engine capacity, weight, etc.).
