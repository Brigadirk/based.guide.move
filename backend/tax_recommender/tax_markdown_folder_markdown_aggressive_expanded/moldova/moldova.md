# Moldova
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
The Republic of Moldova is a small and densely populated landlocked country in Eastern Europe, located between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south, which gained its independence in 1991. Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, is situated in the centre of the country, has a population of around 891,725 people, and represents the cultural, political, and economic hub of the country. The currency of Moldova is the leu (MDL), and the main spoken language is Romanian.
Moldova is a democratic republic, based on the rule of law. Its legal framework is based mainly on statutory law. Under the Constitution, Moldova undertakes to respect the treaties and conventions to which it is party.
As of 27 June 2014, the Republic of Moldova ratified the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) that fully entered into force as of 1 July 2016. Consequently, Moldova should gradually harmonise local legislation with the provisions of EU law. As of 23 June 2022, Moldova has been granted EU candidate status. Moldova set a target date of 2030 for EU accession.
On 14 December 2023, the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Moldova. It is one of nine current EU candidate countries, together with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.
From January to September 2024, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Moldova totalled MDL 233.1 billion, which represents an increase of 0.6 % in real terms compared to the same period of 2023.
