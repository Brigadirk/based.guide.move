## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
An individual who does not set up residence will become subject to full Danish tax liability from the first day of one’s stay if one stays in Denmark for at least six consecutive months. When determining the six-month period, short stays outside Denmark due to holidays etc. are included, whereas stays abroad due to employment may interrupt the six-month period.
