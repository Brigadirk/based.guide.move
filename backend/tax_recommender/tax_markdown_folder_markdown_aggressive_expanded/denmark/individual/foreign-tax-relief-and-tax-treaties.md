## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident in Denmark is entitled to deduct foreign income taxes paid or accrued on foreign-source income from the Danish tax payable up to a maximum of Danish tax paid on that part of the taxable income that is foreign-source income. Relief according to DTTs may be claimed if their provisions are more favourable.
Unutilised credits are not refundable and cannot be carried back or forward.
## Tax treaties
### Double taxation treaties (DTTs)
To avoid double taxation on income, Denmark has concluded DTTs with a large number of countries. All tax treaties contain rules on tax information exchanges, and specific EU regulations also apply.
Double taxation may also occur in relation to inheritance tax. To counteract this situation, Denmark has concluded treaties with the other Scandinavian countries, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States in this respect.

| Argentina | Faroe Islands | Latvia | Sweden |
