## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
The determination of an alien's residence status is subject to a set of relatively objective tests. These rules generally treat the following individuals as residents:
Special rules apply when determining the portion of the year an individual will be treated as a resident or non-resident in the first and last years of residency.
Note that resident alien status often results in lower US tax than non-resident alien status, due to increased allowable deductions and lower tax rates for certain married taxpayers. Consequently, certain non-resident aliens may choose to elect resident alien status, if specific requirements are met.
To the extent that an individual is a green card holder and avails oneself of the residency override provisions of the treaty, the individual may be subject to the expatriation rules discussed above. Professional advice should be sought before claiming treaty benefits for this purpose.
