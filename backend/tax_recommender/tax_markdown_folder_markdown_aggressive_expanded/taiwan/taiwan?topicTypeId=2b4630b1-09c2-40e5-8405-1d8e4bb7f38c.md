## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
## Social security contributions
There are compulsory social security programs that require contributions from employers and employees based on monthly insured salary, which is capped at various amounts. Taiwan social security programs include the Labour Insurance Program (LIP), National Health Insurance Program (NHIP), and Labour Pension Program (LPP). However, foreign individuals are not eligible for participating in the LPP.
Starting from 1 January 2021, under the Second Generation National Health Insurance Program, a supplementary premium of 2.11% is applicable on bonus or incentive payments exceeding the monthly insured salary by four times (capped at TWD 10 million) on an accumulated annual basis for the employee. In addition, Taiwan local employers are required to contribute a supplementary premium of 2.11% on the difference between total monthly taxable salaries and employees’ monthly total insured salaries.
