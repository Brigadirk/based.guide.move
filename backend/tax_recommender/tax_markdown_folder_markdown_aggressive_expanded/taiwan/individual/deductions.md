## Personal exemptions
A resident alien is eligible for a personal exemption of TWD 92,000. Additional exemptions of TWD 92,000 each are available for the spouse and each dependant. For dependants over 70 years of age, the exemption will be TWD 138,000.
A non-resident alien is not eligible for any personal exemptions.
## Basic living expenses difference
The total basic living expense shall be calculated in accordance with the expenses of basic living for each person announced by the Ministry of Finance multiplied by the number of taxpayer, spouse, and dependants. If the amount of basic living expense is higher than the sum of personal exemption, standard deduction (or itemised deduction), and special deductions (not including deduction for salaries or wages), the difference can be used as an additional deduction from the gross consolidated income.
