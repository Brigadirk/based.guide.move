| 120,001 and over | 20% of total taxable income |
\* Taiwan dollars
## Tonnage tax system
A qualifying enterprise having its head office in Taiwan engaged in maritime transportation may elect to be taxed under the tonnage tax system, where a lump sum tax is calculated on the net tonnage of their fleet. Once the application is approved, the enterprise must remain under the tonnage tax system and cannot switch to the regular tax system at its discretion for ten consecutive years. Furthermore, loss carryforwards and tax incentives are not eligible under the tonnage tax system.
## Profit retention tax
An additional profit retention tax of 5% is imposed on any current earnings of a corporation that remain undistributed by the end of the following year. Taiwan branches of foreign companies are not subject to profit retention tax.
## Income basic tax (IBT)
All Taiwan resident companies, as well as non-resident companies with an FPOB or business agent in Taiwan, should calculate IBT if they earn certain income that is tax-exempt. For taxable year 2024, the basic income of a company is the amount calculated in accordance with a formulae stipulated by the government, with a deduction of TWD 600,000. The IBT rate is 12%. If the IBT amount is greater than the regular CIT amount, taxpayers must pay income tax based on the regular CIT amount plus the difference between the IBT amount and the regular CIT amount. On the other hand, if the regular CIT amount is greater than the IBT amount, no special action is required.
