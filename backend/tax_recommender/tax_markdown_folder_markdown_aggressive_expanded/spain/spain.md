## Overview
Last reviewed - 31 December 2024
Spain, located in Southwest Europe on the Iberian Peninsula, joined the European Union (EU) in 1986. It is divided into 17 *comunidades autónomas* (autonomous communities) and two autonomous cities, with Madrid as the capital. The official language of Spain is Spanish, together with the co-official languages of certain autonomous communities within their territories. The official currency is the euro (EUR).
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.7% in 2023. A 3.2% GDP increase is estimated for 2024.
Spain's fiscal deficit in 2023 was 3.7%. Initial estimates place the deficit in 2024 at around 3% of GDP.
