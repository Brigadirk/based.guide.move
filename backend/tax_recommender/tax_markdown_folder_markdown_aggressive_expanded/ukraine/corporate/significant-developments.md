## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Changes related to the introduction of martial law
Several changes became effective from 1 January 2022 related to the following areas:
On 14 August 2021, the Law of Ukraine 1667-IX 'On Stimulating the Development of the Digital Economy in Ukraine' entered into force. The purpose of the Law 1667-IX is creation of a special legal regime for the IT industry in Ukraine called 'Diia City'.
On 14 December 2021, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the Law of Ukraine 'On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine to Stimulate the Digital Economy in Ukraine', which is a tax part of the 'Diia City' special legal regime and provides special tax conditions for residents of the City. The law entered into force on 1 January 2022.
Ukraine denounced its double tax treaties (DTTs) with Russia Federation in May 2022 and with Belarus in November 2022, which have since ceased to be in force.
On 19 August 2022, Ukrainian tax authorities acceded to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information. Thereby Ukraine joins the international framework for automatic exchange of tax-related information on financial accounts of taxpayers under the rules on the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information (CRS). The first exchange of information is expected to be done in 2024 with respect to new accounts opened after 1 July 2023 and individuals' High Value Accounts.
## Diia City: Special legal and tax regime for IT companies in Ukraine
Starting from 2021 the 'Diia City' (a special legal and tax regime for IT companies in Ukraine) started working. This regime is created for the purpose of stimulating the development of the IT sector in Ukraine. Benefits of 'Diia City' include:
## Increased corporate income tax (CIT) rate for banks and financial institutions

Advance CIT payments are to be made on a monthly basis not later than the 20th day of the reporting month.
The following amounts of the advance CIT payment are prescribed (per each place of retail fuel trade):
The amount of CIT advance payments paid during the reporting (tax) period reduces the overall CIT liabilities of the taxpayer for such reporting (tax) period defined at the general CIT rate of 18%, in the amount that does not exceed the amount of the accrued CIT liability for such tax (reporting) period.
The amount of the advance CIT payments that exceeds the overall CIT liability:
In case of non-payment/late payments of the advance CIT payments, the fuel trade retailer is subject to liability in accordance with current Ukrainian tax legislation, with the application of financial penalties.
