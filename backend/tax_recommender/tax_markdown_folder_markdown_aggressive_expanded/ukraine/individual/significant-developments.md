# Ukraine
## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Note that Ukrainian legislation is constantly undergoing changes and developments; consequently, taxpayers should seek expert advice wherever possible.
## Main legislation changes
The major tax reform in Ukraine was implemented in January 2016. The main changes related to individuals and effective from 2017-2021 are the following:
## 2020 tax legislation updates
In 2020, the Ukrainian government passed a law amending the tax legislation of Ukraine. Below we provide the list of main changes/clarifications in respect of taxation of individuals:
- 9% if the individual actually receives the allocated funds (directly or through the chain of indirect ownership) and such distribution took place before the submission of the CFC report.
- 18% in other cases. Recalculation of the tax (from 18% to 9%) and refund of part of the paid tax is possible provided that the individual actually receives the allocated funds and submits an adjusting annual tax return before the end of the second calendar year following the reporting year.
## 2021 tax legislation valid since 1 January 2022
#### Changes related to the introduction of martial law
The following exemptions for PIT and military tax for income paid by a Ukrainian donator have been introduced:
Income provided as funds or goods (including additional benefits) to a taxpayer (and family members of first relationship degree) are not included into their total taxable income for 2022 and 2023 year, and following years until 31 December of the year when martial law will be cancelled, if:
Receipt of such non-taxable funds or goods (including additional benefits) do not require filing of the annual tax declaration by itself. If a taxpayer received other income that requires filing a tax declaration, then such receipt of funds or goods should be included in the tax return as non-taxable income.
## Military tax
A temporary 1.5% military tax on personal income was introduced in August 2014. This will be effective until the reformation of the Ukrainian Military Forces is completed and affects all taxable income of residents and non-residents in Ukraine. The tax base is not capped. Ukrainian employers and other tax agents are responsible for tax withholding.
Military tax from income not received from a tax agent should be paid on a self-assessment basis within the deadlines for PIT. It cannot be relieved using a double tax treaty (DTT).
In accordance with Law 4015-IX, which came into force on 1 December 2024, the military tax rate has been increased or introduced for new categories of taxpayers and is the following:
1. For individuals: Increased from 1.5% to 5%; the tax base is the same as the PIT base.
2. Introduced for private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime: 10% of a monthly amount of minimum salary set as of 1 January of the reporting year (UAH 7,100 for 2024 year, UAH 8,000 for 2025 year) applies on a monthly basis.
3. Introduced for taxpayers registered on the third group of the simplified regime: 1% from the gross taxable income (i.e. revenue).
4. For individuals on military service and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Security Service of Ukraine, Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine, Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, National Guard of Ukraine, State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, and State Special Transport: 1.5% from the PIT base.
Starting from the 1 January of the year following the year when martial law will be cancelled, the military tax rate for individuals will be 1.5%.
Private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime pay military tax not later than the 20th day (inclusive) of the current month. The controlling authority calculates the advance payments. Advance payment of military tax could be done for the whole tax (reporting) period (quarter, year) but not more than by the end of the current reporting year.
Taxpayers who are registered on the third group of the simplified regime pay military tax within ten days after the deadline for filing a tax declaration for the reporting quarter.
Payers of the military tax listed in points (ii) and (iii) above declare military tax in their tax return of a payer of single tax. The penalties that apply to the violation of military tax payment for private entrepreneurs are the same as for violations of unified tax payment for a respective group.
