## Overview
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
Mexico, a constitutional federal republic in North America, is bordered by the United States to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the south and west, the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and Guatemala and Belize to the southeast. It is divided into 32 federal entities (states), with Mexico City as the capital. The currency is the Mexican peso (MXN), and the official language is Spanish. English is also understood by many members of the business community in the capital and larger cities, as well as in the tourist resorts and areas bordering the United States.
