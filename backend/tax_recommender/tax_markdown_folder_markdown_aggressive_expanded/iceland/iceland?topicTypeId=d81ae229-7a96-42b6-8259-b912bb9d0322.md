## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Dividends paid to a resident company are subject to 22% WHT. Dividends paid to a non-resident company are subject to 20% WHT. The final taxation of dividends paid to a company within the EEA is nil, as WHT will be reimbursed in the year following payment upon filing a tax return.
Interest paid to a resident company is subject to 22% WHT, and interest paid to a non-resident company is subject to 12% WHT.
Gross royalties paid to a non-resident are taxable at the standard 22% CIT rate and subject to withholding.
Iceland has signed a draft of a treaty with both Andorra and Australia that are expected to be ratified in coming years.
