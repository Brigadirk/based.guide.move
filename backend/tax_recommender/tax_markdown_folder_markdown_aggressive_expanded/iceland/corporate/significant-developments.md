## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Thin capitalisation rules
An amendment has been made to the Icelandic Income Tax Act no. 90/2003. The rules, which are applicable from the income year 2019, state that interest deduction limitation rules do not apply when the whole company group bears full and unlimited tax liability in Iceland and the companies meet the requirements for joint taxation in Iceland.
