## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
Resident corporations pay tax on their worldwide income less operating expenses. Deductible operating expenses are comprised of all the expenses and costs needed to provide, insure, and maintain income.
Corporate income tax (CIT) for limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited partnership companies is assessed at a rate of 21%. CIT for other types of legal entities (e.g. partnerships) is assessed at a rate of 37.6%.
Non-resident corporations receiving payments for services or business operations carried out in Iceland, as well as corporations operating a permanent establishment (PE) in Iceland or receiving a profit from such establishments, are subject to CIT for their Icelandic income at the same rate as applies to resident corporations.
