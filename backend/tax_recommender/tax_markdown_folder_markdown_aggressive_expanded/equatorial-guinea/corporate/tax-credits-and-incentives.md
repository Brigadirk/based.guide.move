## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 07 May 2024
Some tax and customs exemptions can be granted by the government for some specific economic sectors (e.g. oil and gas sector, public work sector). These exemptions shall be negotiated in the contract signed between the company and the administration (e.g. Production Sharing Contract, Public Work Contract).
## Foreign tax credit
There is no foreign tax credit in Equatorial Guinea.
