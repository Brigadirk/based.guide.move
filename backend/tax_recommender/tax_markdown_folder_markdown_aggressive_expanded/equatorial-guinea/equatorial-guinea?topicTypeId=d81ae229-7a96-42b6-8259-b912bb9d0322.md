# Equatorial Guinea
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 May 2024
## WHT in the general regime (i.e. any sector other than the oil and gas sector)
According to the New EG Tax Code, there is a 10% tax withheld on the gross incomes obtained in Equatorial Guinea by non-resident entities. Therefore, as of 1 January 2025, all services provided to entities located in Equatorial Guinea will be subject to 10% WHT in Equatorial Guinea since the income is from an Equatorial Guinea source.
There is a 10% WHT on royalties for non-CEMAC residents.
Dividends and interests paid to non-residents are subject to 15% WHT.
Concerning CEMAC resident entities or individuals, they are subject to a maximum WHT rate of 10%. For the record, CEMAC countries include Cameroon, Gabon, Chad, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, and Equatorial Guinea.
## WHT on the oil and gas sector
In Equatorial Guinea:
In practice, the tax authorities consider this tax only applies to sales of services.
The tax basis is composed of the gross amount paid to the provider.
The WHT paid by non-resident entities/individuals is considered as final tax.
The WHT suffered by resident entities/individuals is considered as a tax credit to be offset against the CIT due.
