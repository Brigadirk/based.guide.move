## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
The depreciation rates are determined according to common usage and the accounting rules, for example:
According to the new provisions of FL2023, it is expected that fixed asset depreciation periods and rates will be determined by an order from the Ministry of Finance.
## Low-value fixed assets
Starting from 2022, low-value fixed assets are deductible up to DZD 60,000.
## Goodwill
Under the SCF, goodwill is registered in the local books as a non-current/intangible asset of the balance sheet and can be amortised over a period of 20 years. Therefore, the depreciation of goodwill recorded according to the Algerian accounting standards is deductible from the CIT base with no limitation.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible when paid and cannot be capitalised and depreciated.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible when paid.
## Bad debt
A bad debt provision becomes deductible when legal action has been taken to recover the debt or when evidence is provided that the receivable has become irrecoverable.
## Charitable contributions and subsidies
Granted subsidies and contributions for charitable organisations are deductible for CIT calculation purposes up to DZD 4 million/fiscal year.
## Advertising gifts
Advertising gifts are deductible up to DZD 1,000 /unit, up to the limit of DZD 500,000.
## Pension expenses
Pension expenses are deductible when paid.
## Payments to directors
Payments to directors are deductible.
For expenses incurred within the framework of R&D, as well as those incurred within the framework of ’open innovation programs‘, that are carried out by companies with the ’start-up‘ or ’incubator‘ label, the rate of deductibility is set at 30% of the taxable profit, capped at DZD 200 million.
## Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments
Bribes, kickbacks, and illegal payments are non-deductible from the CIT basis.
## Legal fines and penalties
Legal fines and penalties are non-deductible from the CIT basis.
## Contractual penalties
Penalties paid as part of contractual provisions are deductible for CIT calculation purposes, provided that the beneficiary of penalties is a taxable entity in Algeria.
## Taxes
Taxes duly paid are deductible, except for the CIT itself, which is not deductible. Also non-deductible for CIT purposes are the tax on apprenticeship and training and tax on passenger cars.
## Net operating losses
Carryforward losses are permitted until the fourth fiscal year following the year of loss. Carryback losses are not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible when effectively paid.
