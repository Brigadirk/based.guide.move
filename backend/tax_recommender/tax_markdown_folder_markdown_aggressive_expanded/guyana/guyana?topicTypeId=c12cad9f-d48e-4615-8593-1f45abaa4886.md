## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
Resident companies are liable to tax on their worldwide income. Non-resident companies that carry on a trade or business in Guyana are subject to tax on the income that is derived from Guyana.
The current rates of corporate tax are as follows:
| Type of company | Corporate tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Telephone companies | 45 |
| Commercial companies \* | 40 |
| Other companies (non-commercial) | 25 |
| Both non-commercial and commercial | 25/40 |
| Small business engaged in manufacturing and construction services and registered with the Small Business Bureau | 25 |
\* A commercial company is one that derives at least 75% of its gross income from goods not manufactured by it or if it is engaged in telecommunication, banking, or insurance (other than long-term insurance).
## Minimum Corporation Tax (MCT)
Commercial companies (other than insurance companies) are subject to tax at the rate of 40% of chargeable profits or 2% MCT of turnover, whichever is higher. Any excess MCT over tax at the normal rate is carried forward for setoff against corporate tax payable in subsequent years, provided that in no year is the tax payable reduced to less than 2% of turnover.
## Local income taxes
There are no additional income taxes imposed on companies.
