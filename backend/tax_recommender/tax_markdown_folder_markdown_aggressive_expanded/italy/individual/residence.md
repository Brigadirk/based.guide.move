## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Article 1 of Legislative Decree No. 209 of 27 December 2023, entitled ’Implementation of the tax reform on international taxation‘, published on 28 December 2023 in the Official Gazette introduced significant changes to the connection criteria for determining the tax residency of individuals as provided and regulated by Article 2, paragraph 2, of Presidential Decree No. 917 of 22 December 1986.

Italian tax residents will be subject to taxation for the whole fiscal year (January through December).
Any provision covered by double tax treaties (DTTs) between Italy and other countries shall apply.
The Italian tax authority recently is focused on the assessment of the tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad.
## Potential assessment of the tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad
The tax residence status for Italian citizens who moved their tax residence abroad is carried on by the Italian tax authority and registered into the record of Italian residents abroad (so-called ‘AIRE’).
The increased role of the Italian tax authorities in this matter takes origin from:
