## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Employment income and the following non-employment income are taxable for PIT purposes:
## Employment income
The definition of taxable employment income is broad and includes salaries, wages, annuities, bonuses, awards, and any fees or commissions received in lieu of or in addition to any salary and wages received or receivable by one from one's employer.
## Business income
Business income includes income from movable properties, royalties, and interest.
Income from a profession is defined as income from the rendering of a service with one’s skill for fees and includes services rendered by doctors, nurses, lawyers, engineers, architects, film stars, theatrical artists, writers, painters, sculptors, accountants, auditors, astrologers, and teachers.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Myanmar has a one-tier corporate tax system, under which share of profits received by a Myanmar taxpayer from an association of persons (i.e. partnerships, joint ventures, companies, etc.) are exempted from income tax.
## Exempt income
No tax is payable on non-employment income of not more than MMK 4.8 million and on capital gains if the sales proceeds are not more than MMK 10 million.
