## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate is 20%, and the VAT rate on export is 0%. VAT input is recoverable under certain conditions.
The VAT rate of 10% is applicable for locally produced butane gas.
VAT is applicable to all transactions related to any services performed in Madagascar by a corporate entity with turnover equal to or more than MGA 400 million.
Services are considered to be performed in Madagascar if such services are executed in Madagascar, used in Madagascar, or invoiced to a taxpayer established in Madagascar.
There is no VAT registration threshold for a non-resident supplier. A foreign company that has no PE in Madagascar but renders services to a Madagascar taxpayer is taxable to VAT. The foreign company should appoint a tax representative to collect and pay VAT on its behalf. In the absence of such tax representative, the recipient or business consumer in Madagascar is liable to account for VAT on the services.

VAT collected by the supplier can be credited against VAT output. If output tax is not sufficient to offset input tax, then the difference constitutes a VAT credit. A VAT credit can be carried forward on the following monthly deadlines.
Only free zone companies, export professionals, approved credit-lessors, and companies subject to VAT making investments can claim for VAT refund. VAT refund is extended to VAT paid by oil and gas entities on their importation of services under certain conditions.

A registration fee of 0.5% of share capital is applicable to registration of a new company.
