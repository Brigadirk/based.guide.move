## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
A resident company is subject to corporate income tax (CIT) in France on its French-source income. In that respect, income attributable to foreign business activity (if there is no treaty in force between France and the relevant foreign country) or to a foreign permanent establishment (PE) (if a tax treaty applies) is excluded from the French tax basis.
A non-resident company is subject to CIT in France on income attributable to French business activity or to a French PE, as well as on income from real estate located in France.
France levies CIT as follows:
| **Turnover (EUR)** | Profits (EUR) | CIT rate (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FY opened as of 1 January 2020 | FY opened as of 1 January 2021 | FY opened as of 1 January 2022 |
| < 250 million |  | 28 | 26.5 | 25 |
| > 250 million | 0 to 500,000\* | 28 | 27.5 |
| In excess of 500,000 | 31 |
\* Situation of small corporations not addressed.
For financial years opened as of 1 January 2021, the reduced CIT rate of 15% that applies for small corporations on their first EUR 38,120 of taxable profits (according to the French Tax Law definition) is extended to the corporations realising a turnover up to EUR 10 million (compared to EUR 7.63 million for financial years opened before 1 January 2021).
## Social contribution tax
The social contribution tax is due by any corporation at the rate of 0.16% assessed on the revenue excluding VAT and after deduction of a EUR 19 million relief.
## Patent box regime
Under certain conditions, income derived from the sale or license of patents or patentable inventions, as well as software under restrictive conditions, is taxed at a reduced CIT. *See the [Tax credit and incentives](france/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information.*
## Capital gains
## Local income taxes
No income tax is levied on income at the regional or local level.
