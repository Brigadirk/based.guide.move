## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 18 March 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Under DTTs signed by France, several methods have been established to avoid double taxation. The main one is the traditional deduction of a tax credit from tax effectively paid. However, some treaties establish a tax exemption or the exclusive right to tax. Also, a tax-sparing clause is included in some treaties, which allows for the deduction of not only the tax actually paid but a higher amount of tax.
## Decrease of payroll charges paid by employers (former tax credit to boost competitiveness and employment [CICE])
For wages paid on or after 1 January 2019, the CICE tax credit is repealed and replaced by a permanent decrease in payroll charges paid by employers to finance the French social security system.
## R&D tax credit
The R&D tax credit is determined on the basis of the eligible R&D expenses incurred during the calendar year.
The qualifying expenses are the following:
Regarding the subcontracting expenses, they are subjected to multiple ceilings:
The 2021 Finance Bill provides that:
These measures may apply to R&D expenditures incurred as of 1 January 2022.
The tax credit can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the calendar year during which the wages are paid. Any excess credit can be carried forward and offset against the tax liability of the taxpayer during the next three years.
Credits unused after three years will be refunded to the taxpayer. The 'receivable' (unused credits) can be transferred or sold only to credit institutions. Finally, special provisions apply in the case of mergers and assimilated restructuring operations.
This tax credit is equal to 40% (50% for EU SMEs) of the expenses invoiced by these organisations, up to a cap of EUR 6 million per year. Expenses invoiced by ORDCs in excess of the EUR 6 million limit may be included in the basis for calculating R&D tax credit.
The tax credit can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the calendar year during which the wages are paid. Any excess credit can be carried forward and offset against the tax liability of the taxpayer during the next three years.
Credits unused after three years will be refunded to the taxpayer.
## New 'green industry tax credit' ('crédit d'impôt pour l'industrie verte' or C3IV)
The 2024 Finance Bill introduced a tax credit for green industry, equal to 20% (or 25% to 40% depending on the geographic area of investment) of the amount of eligible expenses incurred. The tax credit could amount to a maximum of EUR 150 million per company (or EUR 200 million to EUR 350 million in the case of investments in specific areas).
Eligible investment expenditures are incurred in connection with activities contributing to the production of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and heat pumps.
This tax credit would apply to applications filed as of 27 September 2023 and would apply to accredited investments until 31 December 2025.
## Patent Box regime
The Patent Box regime resulting from the Finance Law for 2019 provides for a CIT rate reduced to 10% (instead of the current standard rate of 25%) on the net income derived from the disposal (to unrelated parties) / licensing of patents and related IP rights.
This legislation implements the 'nexus' approach, according to which a company may only be granted the reduced tax rate when it has carried out the R&D activities from which the patent/related IP right derives.
Eligible assets must qualify as fixed assets for French GAAP purposes:
A formal election must be made in the yearly tax return.
## Tax reduction on charitable donations
For charitable donations made over a financial year ending as of 31 December 2020, the tax reduction amounts to 60% of the amount of the payments. The fraction of the payments exceeding EUR 2 million is entitled to a tax reduction at a rate of 40%. For the calculation of the reduction, the amount of the payments is taken into account within the limit of EUR 20,000 or 5 per thousand of turnover, whichever is higher.
The tax reduction on charitable donation can be offset against the CIT liability payable by the taxpayer with respect to the financial year during which the donations were granted. Any excess reduction can be offset against the tax liability of the taxpayer during the next five financial years.
## Inbound investment incentives
No particular incentives are available to foreign investors in France. However, the government offers a comprehensive programme of tax incentives and development subsidies to encourage investment in underdeveloped areas.
Capital investment is encouraged through the declining-balance method of depreciation as well as through exceptional depreciation for certain capital expenditures.
