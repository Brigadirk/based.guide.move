## France and the United States sign bilateral agreement on the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
France and the United States signed a bilateral intergovernmental agreement (IGA) intended to implement FATCA. FATCA was enacted by the United States in 2010 to combat offshore tax evasion by US persons. France, with the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Italy, was an original member of the ‘G5’ countries that agreed with the United States to advance the principles of FATCA under the concept of bilateral IGAs in order to address many of the legal barriers faced by financial institutions in complying with FATCA.
The French government has committed to drafting local laws and regulations to implement FATCA among all financial institutions resident in France (including French branches of foreign companies). Broadly speaking, the banking, life insurance, and asset management industries will be most affected, but certain estate (patrimonial) vehicles, holding companies, as well as hedging, finance, and treasury centres of non-financial groups could also be impacted, depending on the nature of their activities.
As expected, the US-France IGA is based on the Model 1A version with an Annex II negotiated to include provisions specific to the local French market and that contains categories of French financial institutions qualifying for exempt beneficial owner or deemed-complaint status.
Compliance with FATCA’s due diligence, reporting, and, in some cases, withholding requirements is necessary for foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to avoid suffering 30% withholding on certain US-source income and payments. The French IGA is intended to simplify the FATCA requirements for French financial institutions, but, in most cases, still requires significant efforts to maintain compliance.
The following are key points specific to the US-France IGA to consider:
French financial institutions, as well as non-financial organisations with financial institutions within their groups, should be taking steps based on the IGA (and in some cases US Treasury Regulations) to ensure they are prepared to comply. Unofficial draft guidelines have been prepared regarding the US-France IGA. This draft is not binding on French tax authorities. Official guidelines were published on 5 August 2015.
## DAC6 - Reporting obligations
Pursuant to the EU Council Directive 2018/822/EU regarding mandatory exchange of information in the field of taxation with respect to reportable cross-border arrangements, intermediaries and taxpayers are subject to new reporting obligations involving certain cross-border tax planning arrangements.
The DAC6 reporting obligations to local tax authorities focus on cross-border tax planning arrangements that meet characteristics or hallmarks intended to highlight risk of tax avoidance and enable more effective audits.
France transposed DAC6 on 21 October 2019, and its provisions took effect on 1 July 2020 as arrangements that occurred as of this date must be reported within 30 days as of 1 January 2021.
For arrangements that occurred between 25 June 2018 and 30 June 2020, the reporting obligation deadline is on 28 February 2021.
## ATAD 3
The European Commission unveiled on 22 December 2021 a draft directive for preventing the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (‘ATAD 3‘ or the ’Directive‘) also known as the ’Unshell Directive‘, by making the benefit of certain tax arrangements (including DTTs) conditional on the existence of a minimum substance for companies established in the European Union.
Concerning the scope, the draft of ATAD 3 aims at companies:
Companies meeting these criteria will be required to include certain information in their annual tax returns to enable the member state where they are established to verify their level of substance. It is called the annual reporting on minimal substance. In practice, the companies will have to disclose:
Depending on the information provided in the tax return, the tax authorities of the member state concerned will be able to establish either (i) the presumption of a minimum substance (criteria fully met), or (ii) the company will be presumed to lack minimum substance and qualify as a shell company. If a shell company is qualified in France, the tax authorities would be entitled not to issue a tax residence certificate, or to issue a certificate stating that the entity cannot benefit from the provisions of the tax treaties or the EU Directives. However, such entity would remain subject to the French tax law.
It must be noted that the above could be amended with respect to the definitive version of the Directive to be further adopted.
On 17 January 2023, the European Parliament approved the European Commission’s draft directive as amended by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). The amendments impact the scope (notably by adjusting the thresholds), the reporting requirements, and the penalties that may apply. The draft ATAD 3 (as amended) will now go before the Council of the EU for consideration. It may be further amended.
This directive is expected to be definitive on 1 January 2024, having a retroactive effect from 1 January 2022.
## OECD Pillars 1 and 2
In October 2021, 136 of the 140 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS), as well as the G20, signed on to a Declaration on a two-pillar solution to the tax challenges raised by the digitalisation of the economy.
Regarding Pillar 1, the Inclusive Framework is expected to prepare a Multilateral Convention by mid-2023, which could enter into force in 2024 (the timetable has been shifted by one year from the initial announcements), aiming to introduce a reform that allocates to ’market jurisdictions‘ a fraction of the global profits of ’MNEs, whether or not they locally have a physical presence. It would apply to MNEs with profitability above 10% and global turnover initially above EUR 20 billion.
Regarding Pillar 2, a draft EU Directive (‘GloBE Directive‘) has been published in December 2022 by the EU Council, aiming to introduce an effective minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on the benefits of MNEs that fall within the scope.
Currently, France also levies a tax on digital services.
