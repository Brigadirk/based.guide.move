## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Saint Lucia has extended the tax amnesty program for taxpayers who have outstanding tax arrears of corporation tax, personal income tax (PIT), value-added tax (VAT), pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), withholding tax (WHT), and property tax. The amnesty will run until 1 May 2025, and there will be a waiver of all penalties and interest for periods up to and including income year 2021.
Saint Lucia has introduced a 2.5% Health and Citizen Security Levy, effective 2 August 2023, on certain goods and services provided to residents. The levy is to be applied *ad valorem* on the cost, insurance, and freight value of goods. It is to be applied to invoices generated for goods and services effective 2 October 2023.
Effective 1 July 2023, Saint Lucia has increased excise tax on tobacco products by 50%.
