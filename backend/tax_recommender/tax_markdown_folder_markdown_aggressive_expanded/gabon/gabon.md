## Overview
Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
Gabon, located on the Atlantic coast of Central Africa, is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, and the Republic of the Congo to the east and south. Gabon gained its independence from France in 1960 and is a republic with a presidential form of government. It is divided into nine provinces, with Libreville as the capital. The official language of Gabon is French, while 32% of the people speak the Fang language. Gabon’s currency is the *Coopération financière en Afrique Centrale* (Central African CFA) franc (XAF).
