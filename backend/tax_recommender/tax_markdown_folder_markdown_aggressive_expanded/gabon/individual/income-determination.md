Last reviewed - 04 March 2024
## Employment income
The IRPP is calculated on the net global revenue earned by the taxpayer during the course of a calendar year (1 January until 31 December).
The net global revenue is equivalent to the total net revenue of the following types of incomes:
The IRPP is due by the head of the family for one’s own revenues, those of one’s spouse, and of one’s dependent children.
Regarding salaries, the taxable income includes all cash remuneration, allowances, acquisition gain related to the allocation to employees of free shares on preferential basis, and bonuses paid to employees. However, some bonuses listed in the Gabonese General Tax Code are exempted from the tax, provided they do not exceed the ceiling of XAF 4 million per year.
### Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind, such as housing, electricity, water, domesticity, and food, are taxed according to a schedule of deemed values, as follows:
### Expatriate tax concessions
Travel expenses incurred by the employer for the holidays of expatriates and their family are exempted from the IRPP, up to the limit of one direct air ticket per year from their employment location to their country of origin.
## Business income
Allowances for business expenses are exempted from the IRPP, provided that they are used according to their subject and that they are justified.
## Capital gains
