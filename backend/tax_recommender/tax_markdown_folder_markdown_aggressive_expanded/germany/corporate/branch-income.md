## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
Both corporation tax and trade tax are imposed on the taxable income of a foreign company's German branch. The rates are the same for branches as for resident German companies, although the WHT on dividend distributions by German companies is not deducted from profits transferred by a German branch to its foreign head office.
