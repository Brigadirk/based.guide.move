## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 28 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
If a double tax treaty (DTT) exists, double taxation is usually avoided by exempting the foreign income with progression. Foreign income taxes can only be credited against German income tax if a tax credit is provided in the applicable DTT or a DTT does not exist. A tax credit is only possible up to the amount of German income taxes on the specific foreign income.
## Tax treaties
German national income tax law has been modified and superseded by various tax treaties with foreign countries to ensure that income is not taxed by more than one country. Germany has concluded DTTs, applicable for income taxes, with nearly 90 countries, amongst them most of the industrialised countries. However, DTTs have not been concluded with, for example, Brazil and Hong Kong. The DTT with the United Arab Emirates expired on 31 December 2021 and has not been renewed.
Germany currently has double-taxation agreements with the below mentioned countries:
