## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
In Colombia, the customary costs and expenses of a business are generally acceptable as deductible expenditure for CIT purposes, provided they are necessary, proportional, have a cause-effect relationship with the income producing activity, and have been realised during the relevant tax year under the accrual method of accounting. Examples of common (and not so common) deductions include the items below.
## Depreciation
### Assets held as of 2016 and previous years
Assets acquired and reported as of 31 December 2016 will be depreciated following the fiscally accepted methodologies for 2016 and previous years. In regard to those assets, the normal estimated useful lives are as follows:
| Asset | Useful life (years) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings and pipelines | 20 |
| Machinery and equipment, office furniture, and fixtures | 10 |
| Vehicles and computer equipment | 5 |
The acceptable methods for depreciation are:
Depreciation rates can be increased by 25% for each additional eight-hour shift of asset use (and *pro rata* for fractions thereof). When tax depreciation exceeds book depreciation, the taxpayer is required to establish a reserve equivalent to 70% of the difference. Recapture of depreciation on the sale of depreciated property is taxable for CIT.
### Assets acquired since 2017 onwards
For assets acquired after 31 December 2016, IFRS rules apply. In accordance, such assets will be depreciated in consideration with the effective benefits that are expected to be obtained. Under IFRS rules, equipment will not only be seen as a whole; instead, each part of it could be recognised as unique, and its depreciation may vary as well.
Note that for fiscal purposes, both regulations (depreciation for 2016 and IFRS) will be valid at the same time depending on whether the asset was acquired in FY 2016 or FY 2017 onwards. Therefore, depreciation outstanding balances of fixed assets held as of 31 December 2016 must be depreciated during the lifespan of the asset using one of the accounting methodologies applicable before the tax bill enactment (*please see Assets held during 2016 and previous years above*).
For assets acquired from 2017 onwards, the depreciation rules under IFRS are accepted. For income tax purposes, taxpayers obligated to have accounting books are allowed to deduct the reasonable depreciation quantities recognised for assets used in businesses or activities yielding income during the taxable period. Nevertheless, the deduction for depreciation of assets is limited to the following percentages:
| Depreciable assets | Annual fiscal rate for depreciation (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Constructions and buildings | 2.22 |
| Pipelines, plants, and networks | 2.50 |
| Communication routes | 2.50 |
| Fleet and airborne equipment | 3.33 |
| Fleet and iron equipment | 5.00 |
| Fleet and fluvial equipment | 6.67 |
| Weapon and surveillance equipment | 10.00 |
| Electrical equipment | 10.00 |
| Fleet and terrestrial transport equipment | 10.00 |
| Machinery and equipment | 10.00 |
| Movable goods and belongings | 10.00 |
| Scientific medical equipment | 12.50 |
| Bottles or recipients, packages, and tools | 20.00 |
| Computer equipment or hardware | 20.00 |
| Data processing network | 20.00 |
| Communication equipment | 20.00 |
Note that depreciation rates can be increased by 25% for each additional 16 hour shift of asset use.
To the extent that accounting depreciation is higher than the limits established in the law, it will generate a difference that can still be deducted after the asset’s useful life. However, this additional deduction is limited to the thresholds previously exposed.
## Amortisation of intangible assets
As a general rule, taxpayers can amortise, for CIT purposes, the cost of any acquired intangible asset over a period of five years using the straight-line method. The factor allowed per year as deductible is 20% of the fiscal cost.
Amortisation is available for intangible assets complying with the following requirements:
Acquisition of intangible assets between related parties is not subject to amortisation, unless transfer pricing rules apply
## Goodwill
Goodwill pending balances generated before 1 January 2017 will be deductible for CIT purposes, provided they are related to the business activity or income-producing activity and its loss of value can be proved. Goodwill must be amortised using the straight-line methodology within five years from 1 January 2017 onwards.
Goodwill generated from 2017 onwards will not be deductible for CIT purposes. Goodwill has been acknowledged as an intangible asset when formed or created by the enterprise. However, its tax basis will be zero.
### Goodwill on share purchases
Goodwill on share purchases cannot be deducted via amortisation from 2017 onwards.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible for CIT purposes, provided they are necessary, reasonable, and have been realised during the relevant tax year under the accrual method of accounting.
## Interest expenses
Taxpayers are generally entitled to deduct any interest paid to financial institutions or to third parties, provided certain requirements are met.
The Colombian Tax Regime has incorporated thin capitalisation rules (*see Thin capitalisation in the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html) *section*).
## Bad debt
Bad debt is deductible for CIT purposes, provided the debt is originated as a result of the development of an income-producing activity and complies with the quantities accepted by the regulation. Additionally, debts incurred between related parties, associated individuals, or between entities and its shareholders will not be allowed as deductible bad debts.
Provision of bad debt credits and provision of risk ratios generated during the taxable year by entities subject to surveillance of the Financial Superintendence can be deducted for CIT purposes. Additionally, provisions generated during the taxable year regarding assets received via payment in kind and leasing agreements to be developed in accordance with the current laws will be deductible.
Nevertheless, no deduction will be allowed for bad debt if:
## Charitable contributions
## Expenses incurred abroad
As a general rule, the deduction of expenses incurred abroad for yielding national-source income is limited to 15% of the taxpayer’s net income, when such expenses were not subject to WHT (i.e. foreign-source income not subject to tax in Colombia). The following exceptions are applicable:
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
Taxpayers can deduct 100% of the taxes, surcharges, and contributions at year of accrual, as long as they are related with the commercial activity of the taxpayer, including affiliation quotas paid to guilds.
It is possible to deduct 50% of the financial transactions tax, even for those cases where there is no nexus between the economic activity of the taxpayer and the economic fact triggering the tax.
## Special deductible items
Colombian income tax laws have established certain special deductible items, which include the following:
## Deductibility limitation
The following special deductions, exempt income, and tax discounts cannot exceed 3% of the net taxable income (before deducting them):
## Net operating losses
Net tax losses generated from 2017 onwards can be carried forward within the following 12-year period. Recovery of tax loss is uncertain for long-time projects.
Net tax losses generated through the end of 2016 and previous years can be carried forward without limitation. The value of such losses must be adjusted for inflation as of 31 December 2016, as no further adjustments are allowed.
In order to find out the total value of losses generated before 31 December 2016 that can be carried forward, a simple calculation must be made. In this calculation, income tax for equality (CREE) tax losses and CIT losses will be merged to define the final value to be carried forward (Section 123 of Law 1819 of 2016 explains further considerations in this regard).
Be advised that no tax loss is allowed in the sale of assets between related parties. Additionally, capital losses cannot be offset against ordinary income.
## Payments to foreign related parties
### Royalties and similar charges
Royalties and the costs of exploitation or acquisition of all kinds of intangible property that are charged by foreign related parties are allowable as CIT deduction, provided that the corresponding WHT is collected at generally 20% (10% in the case of most DTTs). Other types of payments are subject to the general rules for expenses incurred abroad.
Royalties recognised to non-resident (or FTZ-located) related parties are not deductible if connected with an intangible formed in Colombia. Additionally, royalties paid for finished products are non-deductible.
### Management overhead expenses
Management overhead expenses paid to a foreign related party (e.g. the parent company) are deductible, provided they meet the arm’s-length test under transfer pricing regulations and provided the management services are duly substantiated and are specifically related to the income-producing activity of the local subsidiary that pays them.
These expenses must also be carefully documented such that the local subsidiary can provide evidence to the authority of the fact that they are specifically related to its Colombian operations (i.e. to the planning and direction of the operations, the setting and implementation of management controls, the measurement of progress made toward specific business goals, the related financial results, etc.). Regardless of whether these services are supplied outside or inside Colombia, a 33% WHT is also required to ensure deductibility.
### Interest
Interest and related financial costs (including foreign exchange losses) paid to foreign related parties are deductible, provided they meet the arm’s-length test under transfer pricing regulations and the thin capitalisation rules (*see the*[*Group taxation*](group-taxation.html)*section*).
Furthermore, interest and the related financial costs paid on short-term financing relating to imports of merchandise and raw materials directly supplied by foreign related parties are also deductible for CIT purposes. Interest paid or accrued to a non-resident triggers WHT over the payment or accrual at a rate of 20%. However, this rate can be reduced to 15% if the maturity term of the loan is equal to or higher than one year.
