# Congo, Republic of
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
The current investment regime in the Republic of Congo was set out by Law No. 6-2003 of 18 January 2003, which established the investment charter. The charter's application, Decree No. 2004-30 of 18 February 2004, established modes of business registration.
The goods eligible for the customs incentives from the investment charter are those that have a direct link with the fiscal year of the approved activity.
Any company admitted to one of the authorised derogatory regimes (i.e. the production sharing contract regime or the establishment agreement regime) may no longer, as of 1 January 2021, benefit from another privileged regime.
## Privileged regimes
The charter sets out three privileged regimes:
### General regime (G)
The general regime applies to businesses that fulfil the aforementioned general requirements and carry out investments greater than or equal to XAF 100 million.
Special advantages are conferred according to the period of activity of the registered business.
During the set-up period and the first three exploitation tax years, the company receives several benefits, as follows:
For the three first exploitation tax years and from the first year of sale or first service, the following fiscal benefits are added with the aforementioned reduction of registration duties:
### Special regime (S)
The special regime applies to businesses that fulfil the aforementioned general requirements and carry out investments between XAF 30 million and XAF 100 million.
In addition to the advantages of the aforementioned (G) regime, businesses registered under the (S) regime benefit during the set-up period and the first three exploitation tax years from the moderation of registration duties for the incorporation of the business, increases in capital, company mergers, and transfer of company stocks and shares.
This moderation of registration duties is granted exclusively by decree of the Minister in charge of the Economy and Finances upon a decision of the National Investment Commission.
### Preferential development zone regime
All exporting businesses registered under the investment charter are eligible for the preferential development zone system, including free-trade zones.
The institution, organisation, and function of the preferential development zone are fixed by a specific text.
## Incentives to set up in remote areas
All new businesses registered under (G) or (S) regimes that are located in a remote area benefit from a reduction of 50% on the tax on company earnings in the fourth and fifth year following the first three tax years for which the business benefited from total exemption from the tax on earnings or PIT.
The business is considered as belonging to a remote area from the moment its production units are set-up and 90% of the production unit workforce is working in the remote location.
The appraisal of a zone's location results from the exclusive competency of the National Investment Commission.
## Incentives for social and cultural investment
All new businesses registered under (G) or (S) regimes carrying out investments of a social and cultural character may benefit from a fiscal reduction by ministerial decree of the Minister in charge of Finance and the Economy, upon the decision of the National Investment Commission.
These benefits may not, however, be added to those mentioned above and allocated to remote areas, even if the business concerned is set-up in such a location.
## General measures
For the duration of the privileged regime, and subject to current texts, the company shall enjoy fiscal stability in terms of local and state taxes.
Privileged regimes (G) and (S) are allocated only once and are not renewable. The business may receive fiscal and customs advantages pertaining to the set-up period.
Fiscal advantages concerning the exploitation period are applicable only after the set-up period.
The end of the set-up period is certified by decision of the Minister in charge of Finance and the Economy after the adoption of the verification report by the National Investment Commission.
Respect of the aforementioned general requirements set out by the charter is a prerequisite for benefiting from these motivation measures.
## Export incentives
A measure is reserved for businesses that export at least 20% of their production.
The benefits are as follows:
Non-manufactured goods remain subject to the common law export system.
## Incentive to reinvest earnings
A measure is reserved for businesses that carry out new investments of at least one-third of existing assets.
The benefit conferred consists of a 50% reduction of the tax on company earnings for the three years following the realisation of the investment.
Notwithstanding, this benefit is granted upon the following conditions:
## Institution of preferential tax regime for special economic and industrial zones and health free zones
The 2014 Finance Act provides for incentives in special economic zones as follows:
The 2014 Finance Act provides for incentives in industrial zones as follows:
The 2014 Finance Act provides for incentives in health free zones, as follows:
It should be noted that eligibility requirements for the preferential regimes described above have not been set yet.
## Foreign tax credit
There are no specific rules relating to foreign tax credits in the Republic of Congo.
