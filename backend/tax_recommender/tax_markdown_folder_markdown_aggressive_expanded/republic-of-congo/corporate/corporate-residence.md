## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
A company is considered resident in the Republic of Congo if it has its registered office or principal office for all its activities in the Republic of Congo.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The 2020 Finance Act has introduced a definition to the notion of PE, to mean: an economic activity shall be deemed to be carried on in the Congo when such activity is habitually exercised either through a PE or through representatives without independent professional personality or when such activity results in operations that form a complete commercial cycle.
