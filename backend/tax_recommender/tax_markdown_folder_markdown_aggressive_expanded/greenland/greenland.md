# Greenland
## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenland is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland is divided into four local municipalities, with Nuuk as the capital. Since 2009, Greenlandic has been the official language. However, in practice, Danish is still much used in the administration. The currency is the Danish krone (DKK).
