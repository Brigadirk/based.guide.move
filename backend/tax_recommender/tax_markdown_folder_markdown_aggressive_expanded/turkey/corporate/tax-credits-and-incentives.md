# Turkey
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A tax credit is granted for foreign tax paid, up to the amount of Turkish CIT attributable to the foreign income. Any unused credit may be carried forward to the following three years. The foreign tax paid must be documented through foreign tax office receipts approved by the Turkish consulate in the country in which the foreign tax was paid. Special conditions apply to foreign tax credits relating to dividends received by Turkish resident companies from their foreign participations.
## Exemption for income from foreign construction and repair activities
The profit from construction and repair activities carried out by Turkish corporations in foreign countries may be exempt from CIT in Turkey under the Turkish CTL. It should be noted that if loss occurs from these activities, it is not possible to deduct this loss amount from the income generated through domestic activities since deduction of a loss relating to foreign activities that are exempt from CIT in Turkey is not allowed for deduction.
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives are available to investors through an Investment Incentive Certificate (IIC), which is obtained from the General Directorate of Incentive Practises and Foreign Capital under the Ministry of Industry and Technology.
In order for an investment to be granted an IIC, the minimum investment expenditures should be at least TRY 3 million for the first two regions and TRY 1.5 million for other regions. To be granted incentives, investment projects are subject to evaluation by the Ministry of Industry and Technology. The incentives under an IIC can be summarised as follows:
In general, the investment incentive legislation is comprised of general, regional, and strategic investment incentive schemes.
### General investment scheme
Investments that are not qualified as special types of investments are subject to general incentives. The incentives available to general investments are customs duty and VAT exemption on the purchase of investment goods (i.e. machinery and equipment).
### Regional and sector-based investments scheme
### Strategic investments scheme
Based on the related legislation, investments in production of products that are highly dependent on imports and meet all the following criteria will be regarded as strategic investments:
Prioritised investments with over TRY 3 billion of minimum fixed investments will be qualified as strategic investments.
### Project-based investment incentive package
### Technology Focused Industry Move program
Preferential Product List: Products in medium-high and high technology sectors, according to the definition of the OECD, as well as products that have critical importance for the development of these industries as determined by the Ministry.
In order for projects to be evaluated within the scope of the Decision, the minimum fixed investment amount for the Technology Focused Industry Move program should be TRY 50 million. For other investments, the minimum fixed investment amount should be TRY 500 million.
## Free trade zones
In general, activities such as manufacturing, storage, packing, general trading, banking, insurance, and trade may be performed in Turkish free trade zones. Goods moving between Turkey and the zones are treated, for all purposes, as exports or imports. However, operations within the zones are subject to the supervision of the zone management (and customs authorities), to whom regular activity reports must be submitted. Consequently, there is a requirement for zone users to maintain full accounting records (in Turkish) with respect to their activities. These accounting requirements extend to inventory records. Customs duty is levied on any unexplained inventory losses as though the goods had been imported into the country.
The right to operate in a free trade zone is conferred by an operating licence obtained from the Ministry of Economy, which reviews the application for conformity with the objectives and types of activity specified by the Economic Affairs Coordination Council.
R&D legislation:
#### R&D deduction (100%)
In addition, in the event of providing an increase of at least 20% in any of the following indicators in R&D or design centres compared to the previous year, then 50% of the increase in the amount of R&D, innovation, or design expenses compared to the previous year will also be taken into consideration as an extra deduction in the calculation of the CIT base:
#### Income tax exemption (95%, 90%, or 80%)
#### VAT exemption and amortisation on machines and equipment acquired for R&D and design activities
Deliveries of machines and equipment that will be used for R&D, innovation, and design projects by the R&D Centres are exempt from VAT.
Stamp tax exemption
#### Customs duty exemption
Goods imported for the usage of studies in R&D, innovation, and design projects are exempt from customs duties. Additionally, any funds, held papers, and applied transactions are exempt from stamp tax and fees.
Please note that, contract-based R&D activities will be out of the scope as stated in the aforementioned Decision, as the companies do not need any intellectual property (IP) registration for contract-based R&D activities to utilise CIT exemption.
If the project results in a loss, it is not possible to deduct this loss from the CIT base. In addition, the income from other activities (other than R&D and software income) is subject to CIT.
### Law No. 4691 on Technology Development Zones
#### CIT exemption
The profits derived from the software activities or products developed as a result of the R&D activities in techno parks are exempt from CIT.
Please note that, contract-based R&D activities will be out of the scope as stated in the aforementioned Decision, as the companies do not need any IP registration for contract-based R&D activities to utilise the CIT exemption.
If the project results in a loss, it is not possible to deduct this loss from the CIT base. In addition, the income from other activities (other than R&D and software income) is subject to CIT.
#### Income tax exemption (100%)
#### Stamp tax exemption (only on payrolls)
The payrolls prepared for the R&D activities are exempt from stamp duty.
#### VAT exemption on machines and equipment acquired for R&D and design activities
Deliveries of machines and equipment that will be used for R&D, innovation, and design projects by the companies located in techno parks are exempt from VAT.

#### Customs duty exemption
Goods imported for the usage of studies in R&D, innovation, and design projects are exempt from customs duties. Additionally, any funds, held papers, and applied transactions are exempt from stamp tax and fees.
The minimum gross wage portion of monthly salary of each Ph.D. student employed in techno parks may be financed from the budget of the Ministry of Industry and Technology for two years, under the specific circumstances stated in the techno park legislation (limited to two personnel).
