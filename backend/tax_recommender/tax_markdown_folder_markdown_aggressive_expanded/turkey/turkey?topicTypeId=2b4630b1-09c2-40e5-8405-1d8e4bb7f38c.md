### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no national wealth taxes in Turkey.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Recipients of property through inheritance or donation are subject to inheritance and gift tax at rates ranging from 1% to 30%. Tax paid in a foreign country on inherited property is deducted from the tax base as a deductible expense. Inheritance and gift tax is payable over a period of three years, in biannual instalments in May and November, except for lottery prizes, for which the related taxes are collected through withholding at the time of payment.
## Property taxes and high-value residence tax
Property tax is calculated in respect of each property at the tax value set at the year of acquisition, which is then re-evaluated annually with the half of the revaluation rate announced by the Ministry of Finance. The rate of the tax on the taxable values of buildings is 0.1% if the building is used as residence and 0.2% for other buildings. The rate of tax on the taxable values of property in lands is 0.3%. These rates will be doubled in metropolitan areas.
Apart from the property tax, for residences located in Turkey with a value of more than TRY 15,709,000 for 2025, a new type of tax was introduced in 2019 to be calculated on the excess value of the residence. The applicable rates vary between 0.3% to 1.0%, depending on the value of the residence.
## Stamp tax
Stamp duty currently applies at the rate of 0.759% over the gross salary for individuals receiving their income from a local payroll. For individuals filing tax returns, this duty is replaced with fixed filing fees currently amounting to TRY 672.40.
## Local non-income taxes
There are no local taxes apart from some minor transaction charges and immovable property taxes imposed and collected by municipalities.
