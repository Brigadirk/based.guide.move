# Finland
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
As a main rule, a company is deemed to be resident on the basis of incorporation. Consequently, a company is deemed to be resident in Finland if it is incorporated (registered) in Finland.
Additionally, foreign corporate entities that are not incorporated in Finland may still be deemed to be tax residents in Finland. Entities that have been incorporated in a foreign country may be deemed to be tax residents based on their place of effective management (*see below*).
### Place of effective management
Corporate entities whose place of effective management is located in Finland are also considered to be resident taxpayers in Finland. According to the Finnish Tax Administration, the place of effective management is a place where the corporation’s highest-level decisions concerning the daily management are made.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE is, in general, formed in line with the OECD Model Convention.
