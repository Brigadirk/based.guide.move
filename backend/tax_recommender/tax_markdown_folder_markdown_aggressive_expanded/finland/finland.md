# Finland
## Overview
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Finland, a Nordic country in Northern Europe, is bordered by Sweden to the west, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east, while Estonia lies to its south across the Gulf of Finland. It is divided into five regions, with Helsinki as the capital. The official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Finland was initially a province, then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th century, and later an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809. It gained its complete independence in 1917. During World War II, Finland was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union. In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; *per capita* income is now among the highest in Western Europe.
Finland has a highly industrialised, largely free-market economy. Trade is important, with exports accounting for over one third of gross domestic product (GDP) in recent years. Finland is strongly competitive in manufacturing, principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population.
A member of the European Union (EU) since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic country to join the Euro system at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are a high standard of education, equality promotion, and a national social security system.
