# Finland
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Finnish residents can obtain credit for final income taxes paid abroad against income taxes payable in Finland on the same income. However, other than foreign national (federal) taxes, other taxes cannot be credited in Finland unless they are covered in an appropriate tax treaty. In some tax treaties, the exemption with progression method is used instead of the credit method in eliminating double taxation, either as a main rule or for some income types. Also, foreign advance taxes can be credited, but the credit needs to be finally confirmed when the final amount of foreign taxes is available, and a correction of assessment may be needed. Any unused foreign tax credits can be carried forward for five years.
