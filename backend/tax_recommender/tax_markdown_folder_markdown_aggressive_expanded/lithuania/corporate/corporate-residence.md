# Lithuania
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
A company is a tax resident in Lithuania if it is incorporated there. It may also be subject to taxation if its activities create a PE for tax purposes or if it in Lithuania earns income subject to WHT in Lithuania.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to local legislation, a foreign company is deemed to have a PE in Lithuania when:
DTTs may establish different rules of PE recognition. According to domestic law, where there is a DTT, the provisions of the treaty take precedence.
