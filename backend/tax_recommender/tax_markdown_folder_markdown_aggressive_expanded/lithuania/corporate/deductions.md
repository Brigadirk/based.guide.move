## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Allowable deductions include all the usual costs that an entity actually incurs for the purpose of earning income or receiving economic benefit unless the Law on CIT provides otherwise.
## Depreciation
Tangible and intangible assets may be depreciated using a directly proportional (straight-line) depreciation method, a production depreciation method, or a double-declining-balance depreciation method. Depreciation may not exceed maximum rates established by the law. For certain typical assets, depreciation rates relevant for tax purposes are shown in the chart below:
| Asset | Depreciation period (years) |
| --- | --- |
| New buildings used for business activities | 8 |
| Residential buildings | 20 |
| Electrical transmission and communication equipment (excluding computer networks) | 8 |
| Furniture | 6 |
| Plant and machinery | 5 |
| Trucks, trailers, semi-trailers, buses (not older than 5 years) | 4 |
| Computer and communications equipment | 3 |
| Software | 3 |
## Goodwill
Goodwill can be amortised for tax purposes using a straight-line method over 15 years after a merger of a purchasing company and an acquired company, provided that certain conditions are met.
## Start-up expenses
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are generally deductible for tax purposes. Interest expenses should be generally recognised as non-deductible for tax purposes if, after acquisition, a purchasing company and an acquired company are merged and debt used for acquisition of shares is pushed down to the acquired company (possibility to deduct interest after merger remains only if certain conditions are met, e.g. economic benefit for surviving entity from such exercise is substantiated).
Interest paid to related parties may be non-deductible for tax purposes if thin capitalisation rules are infringed, limits of the EBITDA rule are exceeded, or the interest rate on a debt from the related party does not correspond to a fair market interest rate (*see Thin capitalisation and EBITDA rules and Transfer pricing in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Charitable contributions
Generally, double the amount of donation/sponsorship can be deducted for tax purposes (i.e. 200% deduction is available) but only if donation/sponsorship was provided to registered recipients and only up to a limit of 40% of taxable result before deduction of donation/sponsorship and utilisation of tax losses carried forward.
## Taxes
All taxes, fees, and other compulsory payments to the state budget are deductible for CIT purposes, except VAT and CIT paid to the budget. Note that VAT can be treated as deductible for CIT purposes if it is treated as fully or partly non-deductible for VAT purposes and this input/import VAT relates to deductible expenses.
## Other significant items
Limited deductible expenses also include the following:
Non-deductible expenses also include the following:
## Net operating losses
Operating losses may be carried forward for an indefinite period, provided that certain requirements are met.
Losses incurred due to the transfer of securities and/or derivative financial instruments may be carried forward for five years (indefinitely for financial institutions) and can offset only profit from transfer of securities and/or derivative financial instruments.
Reduction of taxable profit by accumulated tax losses is limited to 70% of the taxable profit for the current year (except for entities that are subject to the reduced CIT rate of 5% (6% from 1 January 2025)). The rest of the accumulated tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period of time. However, such transfer shall be terminated if the entity ceases to carry on the activities that caused these losses, unless the entity ceases to carry on the activities for reasons beyond its control.
No limitation for carry forward due to the change of direct or indirect ownership of the entity arises, unless legal status of the entities is changed.
Current year operating losses can be transferred to another legal entity of the group if certain conditions are met.
No carryback of losses is available in Lithuania.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates (e.g. interest, royalties, management fees, fees for other services) are deductible for tax purposes if the payment serves a business purpose, provides a benefit to the payer, is at arm’s length, and is substantiated by sufficient documentation. Payments to foreign affiliates may also be subject to various WHTs. Certain payments to affiliates located in tax haven (blacklisted) countries are subject to a 15% (16% from 1 January 2025) WHT rate.
## Blacklisted territories
A list of 49 offshore territories (including the newly listed Russian Federation since 1 December 2023) has been published. With certain exceptions specified in the law, all payments to offshore companies or their branches for any work or services, commodities, interest on funding, insurance premiums, guarantees, etc. are non-deductible for CIT purposes unless the Lithuanian entity provides evidence to the state tax authorities that:
