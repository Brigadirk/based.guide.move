# Lithuania
## Overview
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Lithuania, located in Eastern Europe along the Baltic Sea, is bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the south and east, Poland to the south, and Russia (Kaliningrad district) to the southwest. The capital of Lithuania is Vilnius. The official language is Lithuanian, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
On 11 March 1990, Lithuania declared its independence. Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in May 2004 and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) in the spring of 2004. Lithuania joined the Eurozone in 2015. As of 5 July 2018, Lithuania is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Lithuania has strong trading relations not only with its Central and Eastern European neighbours (Poland and Latvia) but also with Estonia, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands. The government of Lithuania continues a high-profile campaign to attract foreign investment and to develop export markets. In 2024, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania increased by 2.2%. It is expected to grow by 3% for 2025 and, also, by 3% for 2026. The commercial environment is generally friendly to foreign companies, and most of the EU directives are implemented into the Lithuanian legislative system.
