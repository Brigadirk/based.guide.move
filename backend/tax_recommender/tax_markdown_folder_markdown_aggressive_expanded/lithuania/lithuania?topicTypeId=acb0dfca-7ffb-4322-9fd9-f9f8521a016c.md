# Lithuania
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Inventory valuation
Under domestic accounting legislation, stock used in the production and included in the cost of produced goods is valued in the financial statements by the first in first out (FIFO) method. The last in first out (LIFO), weighted-average, progressive-average, actual-price, or another method that corresponds to the stocks’ movement can also be used. Usage of another method than FIFO is not required to be separately approved by the tax authorities; however, the method used must be disclosed in the notes to the annual accounts.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed as part of the corporate profit of the enterprise.
Capital gains are treated as non-taxable income when they are derived from the transfer of shares in a company incorporated in the European Economic Area or in a country with which Lithuania has a valid DTT and that pays CIT or an equivalent tax. This holds true if the Lithuanian holding company holds more than 10% of voting shares for a continuous period of (i) at least two years or (ii) at least three years when the shares were transferred in one of the established forms of reorganisation. Certain restrictions apply.
Capital gains derived from the transfer of shares/units in collective investment undertakings are treated as non-taxable income, provided that those collective investment undertakings are not registered or otherwise organised in blacklisted territories and/or are not residents of such territories.
## Dividend income
The receiving company does not include the dividends received from other entities in its taxable income.
## Interest income
Interest income is treated as general taxable income and is subject to 15% CIT (16% from 1 January 2025).
## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as general taxable income and is subject to 15% CIT (16% from 1 January 2025).
## Exemptions from taxable income
The following additional types of income are exempt from CIT:
## Foreign income
Income is not subject to taxation in Lithuania if it was received from activities through a PE in a foreign country that is in the European Economic Area or that has a DTT with Lithuania and if the income was subject to taxation there. Since such income is not subject to taxation in Lithuania, costs related to the income cannot be deducted from income that is subject to taxation in Lithuania.
