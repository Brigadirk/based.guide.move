## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Employment income
Taxable monthly earnings in cash and in kind received from the principal workplace include wages, various additional payments (e.g. sickness and maternity benefits paid from social insurance), bonuses, employee stock option benefits, incentive payments, taxable allowances and other similar payments, compensation upon discharge from work (e.g. compensation for remaining vacation), gratuities, and compensation for unlawful dismissal from work.
The following income derived from employment in a Lithuanian legal entity is non-taxable for PIT purposes:
### Equity compensation
For tax purposes, equity compensation received by an employee in kind or in cash is treated as employment-related income and is subject to PIT. The taxable amount is calculated based on the difference between fair market value of the equity granted and the amount paid for it by the employee, if any.
Employee stock options exercised at no cost or for lower than their fair market value price not earlier than three years following their grant date will be treated as non-taxable income for PIT purposes, meaning that taxation should arise only at the time of share sale. This relief applies to stock options granted after 1 February 2020.
## Business income
An individual's business income derived from self-employment and other individual activities, including income received from rent, sale, or transfer of property related to individual activities (not taking into account objects of immovable kind) is taxed depending on the amount of income received. PIT calculated at the 15% flat rate on taxable income is reduced by applying a PIT credit, calculated according to special formulas. Therefore:
Income under a business certificate (including certain rental income) can be received if it does not exceed the limit of EUR 45,000; the excess is taxed at a PIT rate of 15% by applying a PIT credit as commented above.
## Capital gains
Taxable income derived from the sale of property is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price, and the taxable gain is subject to a 15% PIT rate for income amount not exceeding EUR 253,065 per calendar year for 2025. The exceeding part is taxable at a PIT rate of 20%.
The following capital gains are non-taxable:
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to a flat 15% PIT rate.
## Interest income
The following interest income is tax exempt:
## Rental income
Income derived from rent is subject to a 15% PIT rate for the income amount not exceeding EUR 253,065 per calendar year for 2025. The exceeding part is taxable at a rate of 20%.
## Exempt income
