## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
## Autumn Budget 2024
The Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered her Budget on 30 October 2024, announcing the following:
## Changes proposed to the current tax regime for non-UK domiciled individuals
In the Autumn Budget 2024, the Chancellor announced her proposal for the current tax regime for non-UK domiciled individuals to be abolished from 6 April 2025 and a new residence-based regime to be introduced in its place. Proposals for transitional measures designed to smooth the impact of the changes were also announced.
### **Key announced changes with effect from 6 April 2025**
### **Transitional measures for existing non-UK domiciled individuals**
### **Inheritance tax (IHT)**
From 6 April 2025, the current IHT system, based on domicile, will be replaced with a residence-based system. Individuals will be subject to UK IHT on their non UK assets once they have been resident in the United Kingdom for ten tax years. An individual who has been UK resident for more than ten of the last twenty tax years will be considered a ‘Long Term Resident’ (LTR).
Please note that UK situs assets will always be within the scope of UK IHT, irrespective of an individual’s domicile or residence status.
Long Term Residents who leave the UK will remain subject to UK IHT for up to ten years after they cease to be UK resident. The length of the LTR ‘tail’ will be 3 years for those resident in the UK between ten and thirteen tax years, increasing by 1 year for every additional year of UK residence, up to a total of ten.
Offshore trusts will also be brought within the scope of UK IHT where the settlor is a LTR in the UK, i.e. has been in the UK for more than ten years.
### **Other points to note**
## Basis period reform
The United Kingdom (UK) government has brought in significant changes to the way self-employed individuals are taxed on trading profits. The changes are called ’basis period reform‘. The new measures do not impact the UK taxation of non-trading income or capital gains. For further details, see ‘*Basis period reform’ in the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section*.
