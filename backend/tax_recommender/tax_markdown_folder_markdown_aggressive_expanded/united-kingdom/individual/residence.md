## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 15 December 2024
The statutory residence test (SRT) for individuals has been effective since 6 April 2013. The test must be applied in a strict order:
Each of the tests and the underlying elements are defined to some extent in UK tax legislation, and HMRC have produced extensive guidance.
There are four ‘automatic UK residence tests’:
There are four ‘automatic overseas tests’ (i.e. for non-UK residence):
The ‘sufficient ties’ test is met if the individual does not meet any of the automatic UK tests or the automatic overseas tests but has ‘sufficient UK ties’ in a year to make them UK resident. The possible ties are set out in the legislation. They are the family tie, the accommodation tie, the work tie, the 90 day tie (i.e. 90 days or more spent in the United Kingdom in either of the previous two tax years), and the country tie (i.e. the United Kingdom is the country in which an individual spends most of their time).
If an individual has been a UK-tax resident for one or more of the preceding three tax years, they have to consider all of those ties; otherwise, they can ignore the country tie. The more days an individual spends in the United Kingdom, the fewer UK ties are needed for them to pass the sufficient ties test and be UK resident. This ranges from one tie if they spend more than 120 days in the United Kingdom to four ties if they spend fewer than 46 days in the United Kingdom.
The SRT legislation states that up to 60 days spent in the United Kingdom due to exceptional circumstances, which prevent an individual from leaving the United Kingdom, can be disregarded when calculating days spent in the United Kingdom.
