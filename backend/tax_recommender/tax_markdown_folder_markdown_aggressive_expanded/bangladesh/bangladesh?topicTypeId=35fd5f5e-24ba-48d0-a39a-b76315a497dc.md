## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Taxation of individuals in Bangladesh is primarily based on their residential status in the relevant tax year. The residential status of individuals is determined independently for each tax year and is ascertained on the basis of their physical presence in Bangladesh during the relevant tax year and past years. *See the*[*Residence*](bangladesh/individual/residence.html)*section for more information*.
Under Bangladesh tax laws, the scope of taxation differs as per the residential status of an individual.
## Personal income tax rates
### Resident individual or non-resident individual (NRI) who is a Bangladeshi citizen for financial year (FY) 2023/24
| Total income (BDT) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| First 350,000 | Nil |
| Next 100,000 | 5 |
| Next 400,000 | 10 |
| Next 500,000 | 15 |
| Next 500,000 | 20 |
| On rest of the income | 25 |
### Resident individual or NRI who is a Bangladeshi citizen for FY 2024/25
| Total income (BDT) | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| First 350,000 | Nil |
| Next 100,000 | 5% |
| Next 400,000 | 10% |
| Next 500,000 | 15% |
| Next 500,000 | 20% |
| Next 2 million | 25% |
| On rest of the income | 30% |
Note:
### NRIs who are not Bangladeshi citizens
NRIs who are not Bangladeshi citizens are taxable at the maximum rate (i.e. 30%).
## Surcharge on total income tax
A surcharge is payable on the tax by the taxpayer if one’s net worth exceeds the prescribed threshold. The rates of surcharge are as follows:
| Net wealth | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to BDT 40 million | Nil |
| One or more of the following:   * Above BDT 40 million to BDT 100 million. * Ownership of more than one motor car. * Ownership of house property having an aggregate area of more than 8,000 sq. ft. | 10% of tax payable |
| Above BDT 100 million to BDT 200 million | 20% of tax payable |
| Above BDT 200 million to BDT 500 million | 30% of tax payable |
| Above BDT 500 million | 35% of tax payable |
## Minimum tax regime
A three-way comparison of regular tax on profits, withholding tax (WHT) under certain sections (interest on savings deposit, interest on fixed deposit, etc.), and tax on gross receipts (0.25% on gross receipts) must be done. The higher of the three is considered as the final tax liability for an individual having gross receipts of more than BDT 30 million.
## Minimum tax to be applied in case total income exceeds tax-free threshold
| Area | Minimum tax payable (in BDT) |
| --- | --- |
| Dhaka North and South City Corporation and Chittagong City Corporation | 5,000 |
| Other city corporation | 4,000 |
| Other area not being a city corporation | 3,000 |
