## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
As per the Bangladesh tax laws, income is categorised into seven areas, namely, income from employment, income from rent, agricultural income, income from business or profession, capital gains, income from financial assets, and income from other sources.
## Inventory valuation
There is no separate method in the tax laws for inventory valuation. *See Adoption of IFRS in the [Other issues](bangladesh/corporate/other-issues.html) section for more information*.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Any dividend paid by a Bangladeshi company is deemed to accrue or arise in Bangladesh and is taxable in Bangladesh.
Tax-paid dividend distributed in favour of a company, if the company distributing such dividend income maintains a separate account for such tax-paid dividend, is excluded from the gross total income.
Dividend is taxable in Bangladesh at 20% in the hands of a company. The WHT deducted on dividend is considered as minimum tax in the hands of the recipient.
## Interest income
Interest income deemed to accrue or arise in Bangladesh includes interest payable by the government, residents (except when interest is paid for business or profession carried out outside Bangladesh or for earning income from outside Bangladesh), and non-residents (in case interest is paid for business or profession carried out in Bangladesh or earnings in Bangladesh).
Interest income is chargeable to tax at regular tax rates.
## Rental income
Any income earned from the renting of any property after deducting allowable expenses is taxable as ‘income from rent’. Property means house property, land, furniture, fixtures, factory buildings, business premises, machinery, personal vehicles, and any other tangible capital asset that can be rented.
House property refers to any house, building, or structure, which includes furniture, fixtures, and fittings that are an integral part of the house and the land upon which the house is situated. Buildings used solely as warehouses or factory buildings where rent is part of the payment for plant and machinery are not considered as house property.
Allowable expenses from rental income include the following:
When a house property is rented out only partially, the expenses related to the property can be claimed as deductions in proportion to the rental income received.
If a house property is rented out for only a portion of the income year, the expenses that can be claimed as deductions should be proportionate to the duration for which the property was rented.
## Royalty income
Royalty earned in respect of business or profession carried out in Bangladesh or for the purpose of earning income in Bangladesh is taxable in Bangladesh. Royalty income is chargeable to tax at normal corporate tax rates.
## Partnership income
A partnership firm is taxable as an individual. *Please refer to Treatment of flow-through business entities in the [Other issues](bangladesh/individual/other-issues.html) section of the Individual tax summary for details*.
## Unrealised gains or losses
Unrealised gains and losses are not considered for the purpose of computing income from business.
## Foreign currency exchange gains or losses
Only realised gains and losses from foreign currency exchange are considered for computing income from business.
## Other significant items
### Special areas considered as income from other sources (IFOS)
## Foreign income
A Bangladeshi company is taxed on its global income. A foreign company is taxed only on income that is received in Bangladesh, or that accrues or arises, or is deemed to accrue or arise, in Bangladesh. This income is subject to any favourable DTAA provisions. There is no anti-deferral regime in Bangladesh.
