## Foreign tax relief
Individuals who have been taxed abroad on passive income derived from non-resident entities are able to credit the tax paid in the foreign jurisdiction against the IRPF (with a limit of 12%, which is the applicable rate in Uruguay on this type of income).
## Tax treaties
Uruguay has entered into a number of double tax treaties (DTTs). *S**ee the [Other issues](../corporate/other-issues.html) section of the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Uruguay has DTTs.*
