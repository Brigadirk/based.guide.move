## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Tax treatment of payments to seconded employees
There is a reduction of the tax base for PIT for employees that are on a secondment in a foreign country, as follows:
Moreover, seconded workers are entitled to a special tax base, which does not include 20% of the salary or maximum EUR 1,000 in a single month, under the following conditions:
The mentioned exclusion is temporary and can only apply to income that has been paid out in a maximum of 60 months in the time period of ten years from the first secondment.
## Taxation of the business performance payment
The changes to the PIT Act are bringing a more beneficial taxation of the business performance payment. The business performance payment is excluded from the taxable base in the amount of one average monthly wage of the employees in Slovenia. It can be paid in cash as well as benefits-in-kind (e.g. company shares).
Such a treatment is possible if the right for business performance payment to all entitled employees is specified in the employer’s general act or the collective bargaining agreement.
