## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
There is no group taxation regime per the DRC tax legislation.
## Transfer pricing
The following specific transfer pricing requirements are provided by the Tax Code:
Finance Law 2015 imposes an obligation for companies established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to have transfer pricing documentation on operating transactions with their affiliated companies located abroad. However, Finance Law 2015 only provides general guidelines for the information to be provided (i.e. structure of the group, selection of the most appropriate transfer pricing method).
Companies established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are dependent, in law or in fact, on companies or groups of companies established outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo and whose annual turnover, excluding tax, is equal to or exceeds USD 1 million shall submit either a paper or an electronic declaration containing a simplified documentation on the transfer pricing in accordance with the tax administration's template. Such declaration has to be made within two months from the deadline to file the CIT return.
Furthermore, the Finance Law for FY 2020 has introduced the possibility of concluding an advance pricing agreement (APA) with the tax administration on the method of determining intra-group prices for a maximum duration of four years.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in the DRC tax legislation. However, it is provided in the Mining Code, from a general perspective, that, for the holder of a mining licence, the ratio of the funds borrowed against the amount of own funds should not exceed 75/25.
Moreover, the OHADA Treaty provides that shareholders’ equity should be above half of the company’s authorised share capital.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
No specific provision relating to CFCs are provided for in DRC law.
