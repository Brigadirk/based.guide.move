## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
To arrive at taxable income, a taxpayer may deduct all costs actually incurred and which have served in the production of income of the company during the year.
## Depreciation
Depreciation of fixed assets used in the company’s operations may be deducted. Depreciation rates are as follows:
| Nature of the good | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 2 to 5 (depending on the materials used) |
| Machinery and equipment | 10 |
| Vehicles | 20 to 25 (depending on its use) |
| Fixtures, facilities | 10 |
| Item's nature | Useful lives adopted (years) |
| --- | --- |
| Building - general purpose or heavy equipment | 20 to 25 |
| Building - specific purpose | 8 |
| Computer equipment | 3 to 5 |
| Software | 3 to 5 |
| Motor vehicles | 4 or 5 |
| Furniture and fittings | 8 or 10 |
| Office equipment | 10 |
As per the OHADA accounting law, however, assets should be depreciated as per the practice of the specific industry so as to depreciate each category of asset over the related normal expected useful life.
## Goodwill
There is no specific provision relating to depreciation of goodwill in DRC Tax Law.
However, it is generally agreed that taxpayers can amortise goodwill in accordance with the linear system. The amortisation of goodwill rate is at the discretion of the taxpayer, but with the risk that the tax authorities can assess the rate otherwise.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible, provided they are staggered over three or four years.
## Interest expenses
Interest costs on funds borrowed from third parties and invested in the company’s operations are, in principle, deductible. Further to the tax authorities, the deduction, in principle, requires an effective payment.
Please note that if the borrower is a private limited company and the lender is one of its shareholders, the interests on loans paid are not deductible from the CIT basis.
Moreover, assuming the terms of the loan are at arm’s length, the interest expense will be tax deductible in the Democratic Republic of the Congo provided that (i) the interest rate applied is less than the average international interbank market rate in the month the payment of the principal is made and (ii) the repayment of the principal takes place within five years from when it has been made available.
## Bad debt
As a general rule, any kind of provisions (e.g. for bad debts) may not be deducted to arrive at taxable income.
However, provisions constituted by credit institutions in respect of doubtful debts can be deducted from CIT under certain conditions
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions or donations are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Legal or administrative fines of any nature are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible.
## Other significant items
The following are examples of other expenses that may be deducted to arrive at taxable income:
The following are examples of other expenses that may not be deducted to arrive at taxable income:
## Net operating losses
The Finance Act for 2016 significantly amended the rules applicable to the offsetting and carryover of business losses. Henceforth, the new wording of Article 42-1° of the legislative-order n° 69/009, dated 10 February 1969, pertaining to the scheduled income taxes:
There is no carryback loss regime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
As a general rule, payments to foreign affiliates should be at arm’s length and transfer pricing documentation must be provided.
In respect of payments made by a local company to a foreign company for services (e.g. management services, technical assistance services), such expenses are deductible, provided that:
Under the notion of abnormal acts of management, in addition to expenses, any form of benefits or aid granted to third parties without equivalent consideration for the company will be taxable, such as:
Benefits or aids granted to companies within the same group may be deemed as normal acts of management, provided that the company shows the existence of its own interest in granting such benefits or aids. The sole general interest of the group is not sufficient to justify such practices.
