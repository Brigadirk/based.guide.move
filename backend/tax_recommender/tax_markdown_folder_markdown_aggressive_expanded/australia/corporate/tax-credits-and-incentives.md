## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 24 December 2024
## Foreign income tax offsets (FITOs)
FITOs are available to avoid double taxation in respect of foreign tax paid on income or gains that are assessable in Australia. Generally, a corporation will be entitled to claim a FITO where it has paid, or is deemed to have paid, an amount of foreign income tax and the income or gain on which the foreign income tax was paid is included in assessable income for Australian tax purposes.
The amount of the FITO available is limited to the greater of AUD 1,000 and the amount of the 'FITO limit'. The FITO limit is broadly calculated as the difference between the corporation's actual tax liability and its tax liability if certain foreign taxed and foreign-sourced income and related deductions were disregarded. Excess FITOs are not able to be carried forward and claimed in later income years.
## Inward investment incentives
Depending on the nature and size of the investment project, state governments may give rebates from payroll, stamp, and land taxes on an *ad hoc* basis and for limited periods.
## Capital investment incentives
Incentives for capital investment are as follows:
## R&D tax offset
Companies with an annual turnover of less than AUD 20 million can access a refundable R&D tax offset at a rate 18.5% above the claimant company's tax rate. Companies with a turnover of at least AUD 20 million have access to a non-refundable tax offset at a rate equal to the claimant company's tax rate plus 8.5% for R&D expenditure between 0% and 2% R&D intensity and 16.5% for R&D expenditure above 2% R&D intensity; intensity is measured as the company's R&D expenditure as a proportion of total expenses for the year. The rate of the R&D tax offset is reduced to the company tax rate for that portion of an entity's notional R&D deductions that exceed AUD 150 million in the income year.
Generally, only genuine R&D activities undertaken in Australia qualify for the R&D tax incentive. However, R&D activities conducted overseas also qualify in limited circumstances where the activities cannot be undertaken in Australia. Special grant programmes also may be available to assist corporations in the conduct of certain R&D in Australia. These grants are awarded on a discretionary basis.
## Other incentives
Small and medium businesses (i.e. those with aggregated annual turnover of less than AUD 50 million) are eligible to access 'boost' deductions of an additional 20% of expenditure incurred under the following temporary incentives:
Legislation is also before Parliament to introduce a critical minerals production tax incentive (CMPTI) and a hydrogen production tax incentive (HPTI). Both incentives, which will operate in the form of a refundable tax offset, will apply to eligible taxpayers for a maximum of ten years between 1 July 2027 and 30 June 2040.
Cash grants for export-market development expenditure are available to eligible businesses seeking to export Australian-source goods and services.
