## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 24 December 2024
Additional scrutiny is now applied to foreign investment proposals with certain tax characteristics likely to be considered higher risk. Furthermore, a new ‘Register of foreign ownership of Australian assets’ (FIRB asset register) commenced on 1 July 2023, requiring ‘foreign persons’ (which broadly covers foreign entities and Australian entities with upstream foreign ownership) to register a broad range of assets. *See the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section for more information*.
Greater tax transparency measures apply to multinationals, including an obligation for Australian public companies to report additional information about subsidiaries, including their tax residency, in relation to financial reporting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2023. Furthermore, certain large multinational groups with an Australian presence are now required to publicly disclose certain tax information on a country-by-country basis for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2024. *See the [Other issues](other-issues.html) section for more information*.
