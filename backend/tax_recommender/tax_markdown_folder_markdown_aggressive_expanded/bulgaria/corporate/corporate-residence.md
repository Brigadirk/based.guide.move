# Bulgaria
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
A corporation is resident in Bulgaria for tax purposes if it is incorporated in Bulgaria.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
PEs of foreign tax residents (e.g. branches) are treated as separate entities similar to Bulgarian residents for tax and accounting purposes.
The definition of a PE in the Bulgarian legislation follows, in general, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model; however, it covers a broader scope of activities leading to a tax presence in Bulgaria. A PE is generally defined as a fixed place (own, rented, or otherwise used) through which a foreign entity partly or wholly carries out business activities in the country.
