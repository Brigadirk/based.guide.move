# Brazil
## Overview
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Brazil is the world’s fifth largest country. With an estimated population above 217 million, it is one of the world’s most populous countries, after China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan.
Brazil is divided into 27 federal units (26 states and the Federal District), including Brasilia as its capital. The official language of Brazil is Portuguese, and the currency is the real (BRL).
The Brazilian economy is considered large by almost any standard. Brazil is the eighth largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations.
Brazil has a diversified economy with strong companies in the agricultural, commodities, industrial, and service sectors; it has one of the biggest middle classes.
Recent years have been marked by significant economic and political challenges in Brazil. However, despite being considerably affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of economic indicators, its economy ended 2021 on a stronger footing than expected. GDP returned to growth in the final two months of the year, even as supply shortages were still hitting manufacturers.
Brazil implemented a labour reform in 2017, as well as a social security/pension reform in late 2019. Broader tax reform has been under discussion for the last three years, and, although the last bill was not approved, a tax reform is still being contemplated and expected to be implemented in the foreseeable future.
