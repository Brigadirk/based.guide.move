## FBiH deductions
Tax deductible expenditures are all documented expenditures, decreased for the deductible VAT, that a taxpayer incurred for the purpose of generation of profit, provided they are properly presented in the financial statements.
### FBiH depreciation

| Hardware, software, and equipment for environment protection | 33.3 |
| Crops | 15 |
| Livestock units | 40 |
| Intangible non-current assets | 20 |
Property being depreciated with a value of less than BAM 1,000 may be fully deducted in the purchase year, on condition that that the property was put in use.
Depreciated assets, once depreciated, shall not be re-included in the depreciation calculation for the purposes of the tax balance.
