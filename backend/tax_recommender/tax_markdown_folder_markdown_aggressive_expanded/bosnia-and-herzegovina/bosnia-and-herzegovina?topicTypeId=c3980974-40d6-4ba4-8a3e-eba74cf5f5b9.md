## FBiH tax administration
### FBiH taxable period
The taxable period is considered to be the calendar month.
### FBiH tax returns
An FBiH taxpayer is obligated to file correctly and accurately a completed tax return (declaration) with the tax balance to the authorised branch office of the tax administration by 31 March of the following year.
The deadline for submission of annual calculation of business results is 28 February of the following year.
### FBiH payment of tax
A taxpayer shall pay FBiH CIT pursuant to the final tax declaration. CIT prepayments are determined based on the tax return from the prior year and have to be paid monthly (by the last day of the month) for the previous month.
### FBiH tax audit process
The tax system is generally based on self-assessment; however, many large and mid-size businesses are under continuous audit by the tax authority and the indirect tax authorities. The audits may include the entire list of taxes for which the business is liable. Smaller businesses with lower incomes are generally subject to audit on a random basis.

The tax authorities focus increasingly on transactions with related parties with respect to transfer pricing and deductibility of expenses in general.
