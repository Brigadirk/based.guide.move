## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
Polish CIT is, in general, due on income of legal persons, limited partnerships, and limited joint-stock partnerships, as well as general partnerships if it has any partner not being a natural person and does not submit information on shareholders (in other cases general partnerships are tax transparent).
Polish tax residents are subject to tax on their worldwide income, unless there is an applicable double tax treaty (DTT) in place exempting the foreign-sourced income from taxation in Poland. Non-residents are taxed only on their Polish-sourced income. DTTs may result in specific income being not taxable in Poland, irrespective of its source.
The standard CIT rate is 19%.
The reduced CIT rate of 9% can be applied to income, other than capital gains, if the taxpayer:
The lower rate does not apply to tax capital groups nor companies created as a result of certain restructuring operations (mergers, contribution of a going concern, etc.).
In addition to the general CIT obligation, Polish taxpayers may be subject to additional income tax under special tax regimes, including:
(these regulations are elaborated below)
Polish taxpayers can choose an independent income taxation system known as 'Estonian CIT'. Under this system, CIT is generally paid only when income is distributed, such as through dividends. However, specific, stricter rules apply to the other taxable events, such as ‘hidden profits’.
There is no limitation on the percentage of foreign participation in Polish resident companies. Such entities are subject to the general CIT rules. The same rules apply to branches of foreign companies (*see the [Branch income](poland/corporate/branch-income.html) section for more information*).
Certain entities are explicitly excluded from the group of taxpayers under the CIT law (e.g. Treasury, National Bank of Poland). Polish and EU/European Economic Area (EEA)-based investment funds are also exempted on the grounds of such provisions.
Family foundations (introduced to the Polish legal system as of 22 May 2023) are exempt from CIT on the ongoing, permitted (statutory) activities. CIT liability arises only at the time of transfer of the benefit to the beneficiary (at 15% CIT rate). This solution is similar to the one used in the Estonian CIT mechanism.
## Minimum income tax
Minimum income tax is a new tax obligation that is applicable to taxpayers declaring tax losses or negligible income (≤ 2% of revenue).
The regulations were initially introduced as of 1 January 2022. However, upon a postponement, the minimum tax is applicable from 1 January 2024, and the first payment will occur in 2025.
The minimum income tax rate is 10%.
The tax base is calculated as a sum of the following:
It is possible to choose an alternative method of determining the tax base amounting to 3% of the value of revenues other than from capital gains in the tax year.
The provisions provide for a list of reductions from the tax base (e.g. the amounts of donations or R&D relief, for prototypes and robotisation, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) / Poland Investment Zone (PIZ) revenue, the value of expenses included in the tax year as deductible costs resulting from the acquisition, production, or improvement of fixed assets, including through depreciation).
The minimum income tax does not apply, *inter alia*, to financial enterprises, start-ups, entities whose profitability in any of three prior years was no less than 2%, and taxpayers who recorded over 30% decrease in revenues.
The amount of the minimum tax paid for a given tax year may be deducted from the due CIT calculated using the traditional method for the consecutive three tax years immediately following the year for which the taxpayer has paid the minimum income tax.
## Exit tax
## Optional tax rules (so-called ‘Estonian CIT’)
From 2021, a new, optional, and autonomous system of taxation of companies was introduced into the Polish legal system, commonly referred to as 'Estonian CIT'. In this model, the tax is paid only when the income is distributed (e.g. in the form of a dividend). In 2022 and 2023, important amendments with regard to the scope and application of the lump-sum scheme of Estonian CIT were introduced.
The main advantages of switching to Estonian CIT taxation are:
The scheme is addressed to entities operating as joint-stock companies, limited liability companies, simple joint stock companies, limited partnerships, or limited joint-stock partnerships that meet the following criteria:
The lump-sum tax on income is accrued at the moment of the distribution of profit and in a different amount than the standard CIT. In order to avoid abuses, the tax base is extended to other events similar to distributions to shareholders, such as ‘hidden profits’ (i.e. all kinds of benefits towards [directly or indirectly] a shareholder or a related entity), expenses not related to business activities (e.g. 50% of exploitation costs of passenger cars in case of the use not exclusively for business activity), or revenues and costs of undisclosed business operations.
The deadline for paying the lump-sum tax falls by the end of the third month of the tax year following the year in which the profit was distributed. Specific deadlines apply to the other taxable events.
For small taxpayers and for taxpayers starting business activity on these principles, it is 10% of the tax base. In the case of other taxpayers, it is 20% of the tax base.
Considering PIT due from shareholders on profit distribution (at 19%) and special mechanism of reduction of PIT liability for shareholders of companies using “Estonian CIT”, the effective tax rate (i.e. combined CIT and PIT taxation) for Estonian CIT with regard to amounts calculated to the tax base (assuming it is applied by the taxpayer for the period of four tax years) is:
## Family foundations
With the introduction of the legal form of a family foundation into the Polish legal system with effect from 22 May 2023, tax laws have been amended with regard to taxation of economic events related to the operation of family foundations, in particular in the field of CIT.
A family foundation is generally exempt from CIT. This exemption is not complete and does not apply to all tax-significant events from the perspective of the family foundation. In particular, the exemption does not apply to the following transferred or made available by a family foundation (directly or indirectly):
Income tax is 15% of the tax base. The tax base is the revenue corresponding to the value of the benefit or property transferred. In the event of dissolution of a family foundation, the revenue is reduced by the tax value of the property contributed by the founder or founders. A structure was used here in which CIT liability arises only at the time of payment/transfer of the benefit to the beneficiary. This solution is similar to the one used in the Estonian CIT mechanism.
Revenues from business activities other than permitted activities (i.e. ’non-statutory‘ activities) are subject to ongoing taxation at a sanctioned CIT rate of 25%.
The CIT exemption for a family foundation also does not apply to the minimum tax on revenues from buildings.
## Diverted profits tax
In 2022, the new provisions regarding ’diverted profits tax‘ were implemented (as part of the Polish Deal reform programme). The Act of 7 October 2022 amending, among others, the CIT Act (Polish Deal 3.0) introduced further amendments to the provision on diverted profits that apply as of 1 January 2023. Some of the introduced changes were defined as clarifying ones, having impact not only on the income achieved in 2023 but also on settlements for the tax year 2022.
This tax can be imposed at 19% on ’diverted profits‘, understood as certain qualified costs (e.g. intangible services, royalties, debt financing cost, or payments for transfer of functions, assets, or risks) incurred for the benefit of non-resident-related entities and treated as tax-deductible by the Polish taxpayer, provided that:
Diverted profits tax is payable if the sum of qualified costs incurred in a tax year towards related entities constitutes not less than 3% of the sum of tax-deductible costs incurred by the Polish taxpayer in that year in any form.
Since 2023, the burden of proving that a given expense does not meet the definition of diverted profit rests on all Polish taxpayers making payments to foreign related entities.
As a ’safe harbour‘ mechanism, the ’diverted profits tax‘ should not apply if the above costs are incurred for the benefit of a related entity subject to taxation on its worldwide income in the EU/EEA (assuming that this entity conducts a genuine and material business activity). The assessment of whether actual economic activity is material takes into account, in particular, the ratio of revenues obtained by the related entity from its actual economic activity to its total revenues.
The 'diverted income' is not combined with other income (revenue) of the taxpayer.
## Minimum tax on buildings
Minimum tax on buildings is a special type of tax on ’deemed‘ taxpayer’s income from buildings, i.e. initial value of the taxpayer’s buildings, decreased by PLN 10 million.
The basic principles regarding minimum tax on buildings are as follows:
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local income taxes in Poland.
## Global Minimum Tax - Pillar 2
The GMT based on EU Directive/ OECD Model Rules applies to international and domestic capital groups with a total annual revenue of at least EUR 750 million in at least two of the four tax years immediately preceding the tax year in question.
This reform seeks to align Poland’s tax system with global standards, imposing additional tax on under-taxed profits and ensuring a consistent minimum tax rate across jurisdictions.
The transitional provisions provide for the optional possibility of applying the Act retroactively, starting on 1 January 2024, based on the irrevocable choice made. This option is applicable to IIR and QDMTT, while UTPR is not applicable retroactively.
| **Tax** | **Essence of tax** | **Which companies will be affected?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
In practice, if the ETR on business activity in Poland is less than 15% and the substance based income exclusion is not sufficient, an obligation to pay QDMTT will arise in Poland.
The Polish Act does not provide information on the necessity of additional registration for the Pillar 2 purposes in Poland.
The Polish Act provides for the obligation to submit a GloBE Information Return (“GIR”). At the moment, GIR can only be filed locally. However, we expect a change in EU regulations, which will allow only UPE or another designated CE to file GIR on behalf of the entire MNE group.
In general GIR will be submitted by the end of the 15th month following the end of that tax year. There are also transitional provisions for the first tax year for which  relevant a group will be obliged to apply the Polish Act, stating GIR will should be submitted by the end of the 18th month following the end of that tax year. However, this provision seems to be applied only if the election to apply new laws as of 1 January 2024 has been made or only in 2025 in the case if the group starting business activities in counties (jurisdictions) which have implemented Pillar 2 rules in 2024. An exemption from the obligation to submit GIR by Polish companies may be utilised if
IIR, QDMTT and UTPR taxpayers will be obliged to submit Polish tax returns of a given tax year to the competent tax office by the end of the 18th month following the end of this tax year and pay the tax resulting from this return within this deadline. Similarly to GIR, transitional provisions provide for deadline extension - until the end of the 21th month following the end of this tax year - under the same conditions.
As part of the Pillar 2 rules, Polish Act introduced the so-called Transitional Safe Harbour Rule (“TSHR”) in order to lower the administrative burden of complying with said new rules during the first three financial years (i.e. FY24-26).
