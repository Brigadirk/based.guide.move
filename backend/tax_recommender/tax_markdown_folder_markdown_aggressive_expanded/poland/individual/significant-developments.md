## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 22 July 2024
## Personal income tax (PIT)
As of January 2022, a tax reform programme for the coming years, called the 'Polish Deal', was introduced into the Polish legal order. As of 1 July 2022, the amendments to the Polish Deal entered into force.
The Polish Deal set out the following significant changes for taxation of individuals.
### Change to the tax brackets, the tax-free amount, and the tax scale
Changes to the Polish Deal were introduced in two stages:
From January 2023, new rules apply to the application of the tax-free amount, as well as submitting declarations and applications by taxpayers, including for exemption of the tax remitters from the obligation to collect advance payments.
Taxpayers can take advantage of wider possibilities to dispose of the tax-free amount:
### Unification of the deadline of filing the tax returns for taxpayers paying lump-sum tax
The deadline of filing the tax returns (so called PIT-28 forms) for taxpayers paying lump-sum tax was extended until the end of April of the year following the year for which the PIT-28 form will be filed. In consequence, the taxpayers filing their PIT-28 forms for 2022 and following tax years will have more time for filing PIT-28 form (previously they only had time until the end of February of the year following the year for which the PIT-28 form should be filed). This change aligns the deadline for reconciliation of income subject to lump-sum tax with income subject to other tax regimes (such as flat tax or tax scale).
### No tax deductibility of the health insurance contribution for taxpayers reconciling their income with the tax scale
The health insurance contribution (9%) is no longer deductible from income tax. Until 31 December 2021, 7.75% of the health insurance contribution base was tax deductible.
This change affects taxpayers who are required to pay the health insurance contributions.
### New rules for the payment of health contributions by entrepreneurs
From 2022, the method of calculating the health insurance contributions for entrepreneurs has changed. Currently, the rules for paying the health insurance contributions depend on the method of taxation of business activity and are as follows:
Additionally, as a result of the changes introduced on 1 July 2022, entrepreneurs can deduct health insurance contributions under modified rules.
According to the changes, such possibility will be provided for entrepreneurs who tax their income (revenues) differently than according to the tax scale, viz:
However, the amount of the deduction is to be limited, depending on the chosen form of taxation:
### Health insurance contributions for board members and proxies
The provisions of the Polish Deal introduce an obligation to pay health insurance contributions from the remuneration of persons appointed to perform functions under the act of appointment.
Until the end of 2021, such remuneration was not subject to the obligation to pay health insurance contributions.
Consequently, the board members and proxies are required to pay health insurance contributions at the rate of 9% with no tax deductibility. Accordingly, board members and proxies are entitled to healthcare benefits on the same basis as employees.
### Cash PIT, i.e. the possibility of paying by the entrepreneur only after the invoice has been paid by the contractor
The Ministry of Finance offers entrepreneurs the option to pay personal income tax after receiving the payment resulting from an invoice issued to the contractor for goods or services. The new regulations apply from 1 January 2025.
Choosing the new tax settlement method will require meeting certain conditions. This solution is intended for entrepreneurs who do not keep full accounting books, settle taxes using the tax scale and flat tax (including those using IP BOX), as well as lump-sum tax on recorded revenues, who are just starting a sole proprietorship or whose revenues from the conducted economic activity did not exceed PLN 1,000,000 in the year preceding the tax year.
However, receiving part of a given amount due, e.g. in the form of an advance payment, already generates the obligation to pay PIT. The deduction of costs of obtaining revenues would take place at the time of payment of the given invoice, i.e. at the time of their actual incurring.
The described solution is completely voluntary for the entrepreneur and will not affect the current rules governing the need to pay tax after issuing an invoice (accrual method), regardless of whether the amount due from the invoice has already been paid or not.
If an entrepreneur meets the conditions specified by the regulations, to take advantage of the cash PIT, he/she will be required to submit a written statement to the tax office about choosing the cash method by:
The choice of the cash PIT will be valid until a written revocation of the declaration is submitted  (which must be submitted by February 20 of the tax year in which the entrepreneur would like to resign from cash PIT) or until the end of the year in which the entrepreneur met the required conditions.
What else should be remembered
An entrepreneur using the cash PIT will be able to use this method only for transactions with other entrepreneurs who are not related entities, based on issued invoices for goods or services. Revenues from the sale of fixed assets and intangible assets for consideration are not subject to cash method settlement. In addition, the entrepreneur's additional obligations will include: maintaining special records showing invoices subject to cash settlement, monitoring income and cost payments and checking contractors in terms of the status of conducting economic activity. It should also be remembered that if the entrepreneur does not receive payment for goods or services in connection with the issued invoice, in this situation the deadline for recognizing revenue and paying tax will expire after two years from the date of issue of the given invoice.
### Change in tax reliefs:
#### Return to the preferential annual tax reconciliation of a single parent with a child
On 1 July 2022, the Polish Deal liquidated the tax relief for single parents introduced as of 1 January 2022 (i.e. deduction of PLN 1,500 per year from the PIT due). In place of the liquidated tax relief for single parents, the Polish Deal returned to the preferential annual tax reconciliation of a single parent (according to the rules in effect as of 31 December).
Moreover, the annual limit of income earned by an adult child in education was increased. The limit is 12 times the social pension value for December of a given year. For December 2024 it amounts to PLN 21,371.52.
As of 1 July 2023, the possibility of using the tax relief for disabled child is not limited by the income limit of the taxpayer or the taxpayer and one’s spouse. This change applies to income (revenue) earned as of 1 January 2023. Currently, the condition for using the deduction for disabled child is that the taxpayer's income does not exceed PLN 56,000 in the tax year or that the income of the taxpayer and one’s spouse does not exceed PLN 112,000 in the tax year.
#### Relief for the return to Poland, relief for families 4+, and relief for working seniors
The tax allowances apply to the following sources of income:
The total amount of income exempt from tax under the above-mentioned reliefs cannot exceed PLN 85,528 per year. This means that if a taxpayer is entitled to more than one tax relief, the maximum amount of revenue exempt from tax will be PLN 85,528.
##### The relief for the return to Poland
The relief for the return is aimed at taxpayers who live abroad and is intended to encourage them to come back to Poland.
##### Relief for families 4+
There is also a new relief for large families, i.e. for parents with at least four children. The relief is available to each parent separately if both meet the conditions for its application. This means that in case of a joint tax return, the amount of tax exemption may reach PLN 171,056 of revenue.
##### Relief for working seniors
The relief for working seniors applies to taxpayers (women over 60 and men over 65) who, despite gaining entitlement to a pension, will withdraw from receiving it and will still be active on the labour market. In order to be eligible for the tax relief, a senior must be covered by social insurance on account of their income.
The above reliefs may be claimed in the tax return or during the tax year.
#### Tax reliefs for innovative and developing companies and individual entrepreneurs
#### Relief for renovation of monuments
In 2024, the owners or co-owners of properties listed in the Register of Cultural Property were allowed to deduct from their income a portion of the expenses incurred for the renovation and purchase of the historic property.
Starting from 2023, the formula of relief for renovation of monuments changed (as a result of the Polish Deal amendment of July 2022) and currently it will be possible only to deduct expenses incurred for renovation works (under certain conditions) without the possibility of expenses deduction for the purchase of the historic property. Moreover, these expenses will be deductible after the renovation is approved by the provincial conservator of monuments. The taxpayer may deduct 50% of the renovation costs incurred for the historic property (with no limit).
### Changes in the joint reconciliation of spouses
The new regulations introduced under the Polish Deal will allow for the choice of joint tax reconciliation already in the year in which the marriage was concluded. This is a positive change in relation to the currently applicable regulations, which required the spouses to remain married throughout the entire year. Consequently, taxpayers will not have to be married for a whole year to reconcile their annual income together (also meeting the other required criteria).
### Changes in the lump-sum taxation rules
Lump-sum tax on registered revenues is a simplified form of income taxation. The tax base is the revenue, so the costs are not deductible.
Starting from 2022, the rates of lump-sum tax on registered income have been reduced.
For those in certain medical, architectural, engineering, or specialised design professions, the tax rate amounts to 14% (previously 17% or 15%). In turn, the tax rate for certain income related to the provision of designated services in the IT area is 12% (previously 15%).
### Change in taxation of private rental income
The provisions of the Polish Deal eliminate the possibility of reconciliation of the rental income under general rules, i.e. according to the tax scale (except when such income is obtained as a part of non-agricultural economic activity). Private rental income will be taxed only as a lump-sum tax on recorded revenues (8.5% rate for revenues below PLN 100,000 per year and 12.5% on the surplus over PLN 100,000). This means that the total rental income will be taxed without the right to deduct costs of earning this income.
The change came into effect as of 2023. Therefore, taxpayers who obtained income from rental activity were able to use the general rules for reconciliation of this income for the last time in 2022.
As of 1 July 2023, the limit for applying the 12.5% lump sum rate provided for spouses has been increased to PLN 200,000 (earlier the limit was PLN 100,000). The new limit will applies to income earned from 1 January 2023.
### Lump-sum tax on foreign income for taxpayers with above-average level of assets
The Polish Deal introduced a new form of lump-sum taxation on foreign income for individuals who decide to transfer their tax residence to Poland. As a result of choosing this form of taxation, foreign income will be taxed with a fixed amount of tax (i.e. PLN 200,000 for each tax year) regardless of the level of foreign income and without the need to declare in their tax return the sources of such income, the exact amount of the income, and the country in which it was derived.
