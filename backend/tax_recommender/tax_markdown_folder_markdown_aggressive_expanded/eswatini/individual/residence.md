## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Residence is not specifically defined, but effectively anyone in employment or business in Eswatini will be regarded as resident for tax purposes. Work permits are required for non-citizens to take up employment in Eswatini, and, as such, expatriates who work under a permit held by their employers or who are self-employed are deemed to be resident for tax purposes.
