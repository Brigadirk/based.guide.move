Standard valuations apply for various benefits-in-kind and are included in the taxpayer's gross income for tax purposes. These include the following:
| Benefit | Amount included in annual taxable income |
| --- | --- |
| Free housing (paid to a third party by employer) | 100% of payments |
| Personal car used on company business | Formula based on business usage |
| Utilities (telephone, electricity, water, coal, and gas) | 100% of payments |
| Domestic servants (e.g. cooks, maids, gardeners) | 100% of payments |
| Tuition payments | 100% of payments |
All lump sum payments (e.g. gratuity payments, redundancy payments, provident and pension fund payouts) require the obtaining of a directive from the Commissioner of Taxes before they can be paid out to an employee.
## Capital gains
There is no capital gains tax in Eswatini.
## Dividend income
A withholding tax (WHT) is payable at a rate of 10% for dividends received.
