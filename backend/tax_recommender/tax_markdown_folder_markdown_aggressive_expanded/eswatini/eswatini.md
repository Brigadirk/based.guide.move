# Eswatini
## Overview
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
Eswatini, a landlocked country located in Southern Africa between Mozambique and South Africa, is divided into four districts, with the royal and legislative capital in Lobamba and the administrative capital located in Mbabane. Granted independence from British rule in 1968, Eswatini is the world's last absolute monarchy. The official languages of Eswatini are English and SiSwati. The currency of Eswatini is the lilangeni (SZL), which is pegged to the South African rand.
The economy of Eswatini is dominated by the service industry, manufacturing, and agriculture, with approximately 70% of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture. Sugar, wood pulp, coal, and quarry stone are the main exports. Eswatini is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives more than 90% of its imports and to which it sends 60% of its exports. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) account for two-thirds of Eswatini's government revenues, and worker remittances from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income.
