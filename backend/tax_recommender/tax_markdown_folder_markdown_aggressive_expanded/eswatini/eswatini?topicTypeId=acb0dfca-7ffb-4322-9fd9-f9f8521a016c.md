# Eswatini
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 15 August 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation is not specific but is effectively at the lower of cost (i.e. first in first out [FIFO] or average cost) and net realisable value.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to income tax, provided it can be demonstrated that the gains are of a capital and not an income nature (i.e. not recurring transactions).
## Dividend income
### Inter-company dividends
Inter-company dividends are not subject to income tax.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are paid out of taxed profits. Such dividends are not subject to income tax when received by a local company, but they are subject to taxation in the hands of local individual taxpayers at the rate of 10%.
## Interest income
Interest income sourced in Eswatini is taxable.
## Foreign income
Foreign income is not subject to income tax unless it is deemed to be from an Eswatini source.
