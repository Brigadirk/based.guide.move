## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## General rules
Interest payments are subject to WHT at a 15 % rate, unless they relate to the following:
WHT on dividends and profit shares is applied at the rate of 10 %. If the company uses a tax allowance for reinvested profit, other than that earned in the banking or the financial non-banking sector, WHT on such dividends and profit shares is not applied.
## EU Directives
The CIT Act provisions and certain EU Directives provide special treatment for dividends, interest, and royalties paid to related companies in Switzerland or states of the European Economic Area (EEA; Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Regarding interest and royalty payments, full exemption only applies to payments between related companies if:
Regarding dividend and profit shares payments, full exemption applies when dividends and shares of profits are distributed to a parent company of Switzerland or an EEA state, provided that:
The recipient of a dividend or profit share is any company:
EU Directives benefits can apply even before the prescribed holding period expires if the taxpayer provides a bank guarantee on the amount of potential WHT liability. If the holding period eventually will not be met, the guarantee will be used to settle the tax liability.
## Treaty rates
If a country has a DTT signed with Croatia, WHT rates are lowered if the treaty rate is lower than the non-treaty rate. There are specific applications that need to be fulfilled in order to benefit from a DTT between countries.
The following countries have a DTT with Croatia:

Other than the above-mentioned countries, Russia is also listed on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions (effective as of 14 February 2023) for tax purposes. However, considering that Russia has a DTT signed with Croatia, all services and fees listed under ‘General rules’ (*see above*) paid to Russian entities are taxable by rates described in ‘Treaty rates’ (*see above*).
