## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The Croatian PIT system does not allow for joint annual tax return filing.
The annual tax return filing deadline is the end of February of the current year for the previous year.
Obligation to file an annual tax return exists if:
The tax return shows the difference between the annual tax liability and the amount of tax prepayments made during the tax year. Depending on this difference, the taxpayer will be either entitled to a tax refund or will be required to make tax due payment.
The tax burden on income types that are included in the annual tax return can be higher compared to the tax burden indicated at each income category (e.g. other income that falls into the category of annual income).
A special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability arising in connection with employment income and other income that falls into the category of annual income is applicable. The taxpayers are generally not obligated to file their annual tax return. Instead, the tax administration will carry out a special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability.
Taxpayers can realise certain rights that are prescribed by the PIT Act (e.g. the right to increase basic personal allowance based on dependent family members, the right to avoid double taxation) by filing a request for a specific right to be recognised as part of the special procedure for annual assessment of PIT liability. The request filing deadline is the end of February of the current year for the previous year.
Income that falls into the category of final income is not included in the annual tax return nor does it fall under the process of annual tax liability assessment. Consequently, tax paid on the final income is deemed finally paid tax (i.e. it cannot be subject to additional taxation regardless of the amount of other types of income taxable at the annual level).
## Payment of tax
Depending on the income type and taxpayer’s circumstances, income tax prepayments can be paid:
Such tax prepayments may constitute final tax (i.e. in case of final income) or a taxpayer may be obligated to file an annual tax return in order for the final annual tax liability to be determined (i.e. in case of annual income) or income enters the process of annual assessment of tax liability (i.e. in case of employment income and other income that falls into the category of annual income). In some cases, a taxpayer can voluntarily initiate the process of annual tax liability assessment in order to realise certain rights.
Based on the filed annual tax return, the tax administration issues a tax assessment. If per such assessment tax due is assessed, the taxpayer has 15 days from the day of tax assessment receipt to cover the tax due. Otherwise, late payment penalty interest is calculated.
Some of the exceptions to the above process are the following:
## Tax audit process
The tax audit process is usually performed as follows:
## Statute of limitations
The tax administration's right to assess tax liabilities and interest; the tax administration's right to collect taxes, interest, and execution costs; and the taxpayer’s right to a refund of tax, interest, and execution costs is subject to a statute of limitations that becomes effective in six years, counted from the day statute of limitation commences. However, the tax administration may initiate the tax audit within three years counted from the day statute of limitation commences, with certain exceptions.
