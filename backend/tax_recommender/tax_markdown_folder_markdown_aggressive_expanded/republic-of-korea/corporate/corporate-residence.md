## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
A corporation having its head office or principal office in Korea is a resident corporation. A corporation with a place of effective management in Korea is also treated as a resident corporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The term 'permanent establishment' is defined as any fixed place of business in Korea where the business of a foreign entity is wholly or partly carried on.
The following places will trigger a PE of a foreign entity, among others:
Also, in the absence of a fixed place in Korea, if a foreign entity has a dependent agent in Korea (i) who has the authority to conclude contracts on its behalf and who has repeatedly exercised that authority or (ii) who, even if having no such authority, repeatedly performs a principal role in the course of concluding contracts, it will be deemed to have a PE in Korea.
Exceptions to a PE in Korea for a non-resident corporation are limited to specific places of business used only for preparatory or auxiliary nature, and such fixed places include purchasing or storage of goods not for sale, advertising, publicity, collecting or furnishing of information, etc. Even though the specific place where activities of preparatory or auxiliary nature are performed, it could be regarded as a PE in one of the following cases:
Liaison offices of foreign corporations that undertake non-sales functions (e.g. market survey, collection of market information) in Korea are subject to new reporting requirements. With effect from 1 January 2022, these liaison offices must prepare the required information, such as its status, head office, as of 31 December of each year and submit it to the Korean tax authorities by 10 February of the following year. With effect from 1 July 2022, they are required to submit the information on input value-added tax (VAT) invoices received from supplier.
