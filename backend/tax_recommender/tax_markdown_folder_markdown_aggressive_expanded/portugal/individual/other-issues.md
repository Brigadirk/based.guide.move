## Treatment of trusts
Regarding the taxation of income from trusts, the Portuguese legislation provides rules to tax the following realities:
The amounts received as a result of liquidation, revocation, or extinction of ‘fiduciary structures’ are:
Regarding the distributions paid by fiduciary structures, the amounts either paid or made available to a taxpayer from ‘fiduciary structures’, other than those arising from a liquidation, revocation, or extinction, are taxable as investment income (Category E) and subject to taxation at a flat rate of 28% or of 35% (if the trust is considered to be domiciled on a 'blacklisted' jurisdiction), regardless of whether the recipients are settlors or not.
The transfer for consideration of rights on trusts, including the transfer for consideration of the beneficiary position, qualifies as a capital gain subject to taxation.
The rate is 35% in case of trusts domiciled in countries, territories, or regions subject to more favourable tax regimes.
## Tax treatment of crypto assets income
Based on the legislation in force (since 2023), the definition of crypto assets includes all digital representations of values or rights that can be transferred or stored electronically using distributed ledger technology or similar. Unique and non-fungible crypto assets are excluded from this definition (e.g. NFTs).
In general terms, as a rule, the new regime establishes that:
Both the termination of the (self-employment) activity and the cease of Portuguese residency are equivalent to transfers for consideration (exit tax).
