The Ministry of Finance (MoF) issued the new Budget Law no. 324, dated 15 February 2024, published in the Official Gazette No. 7, which introduced several amendments to the taxes and exemptions applicable in Lebanon.
As per Decree no.11224 published in the Official Gazette on 26 April 2023, the employees’ transportation allowance LL 250,000 for each working day effective 26 April August 2023.
Later on, the MoF issued Decree no. 12966 dated published in the Official Gazette on 15 February 2024 , whereby the employees’ transportation allowance increased to LL 450,000 instead of the LL 250,000 for each working day starting the date the Decree was published (i.e. 15 February 2024).
Moreover, the Council of Minister, based on a proposal from the Minister of Labor, enacted Decree no. 12962 which increases in the monthly ceiling amounts for sickness and maternity social security contributions to be 5 times the minimum monthly wage.
Furthermore, Decision no. 1311/1 issued 31 December 2024 exempts termination/severance payments from payroll tax for payments made to employees between February 15, 2024, and December 31, 2025.
The major tax amendments and exemptions are incorporated in the appropriate summary sections.
