## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Income Tax Act rewrite
In 2020, Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) Treasury released for public consultation the much-anticipated rewrite of the Income Tax Act (the Act). The consultation draft proposed a commencement date of 1 January 2021. However, despite consultation during 2021 and 2022, the Bill was not presented to Parliament for the budget session in 2021 and was again not presented in November 2022. As of the end of 2022, there has been no formal commitments from Treasury in relation to further consultation or the expected date of entry into force once passed, although the Treasurer did note that, in accordance with feedback from various stakeholders, the Bill's transitional provisions and certain subsidiary legislation would be fully developed before the Bill is presented to Parliament.
This statement from the Treasurer is a reaction to the fact that despite the rewrite being advertised as an attempt to simplify tax law to enable greater participation, and ultimately greater compliance, in the tax system, a number of design features have permeated the initial and most recent drafts, including:
A number of the proposed policy shifts that may impact companies include:
## 2024 legislative developments
The National Budget for 2024 introduced legislation to make a temporary increase in the tax-free threshold for salary and wages tax imposed on individuals (SWT) into a permanent change. The annual tax-free threshold is now 20,000 PNG kina (PGK).
There was also a repeal of the dependent tax rebate that was available for individuals to be applicable from 1 January 2024. However, during early 2024, in response to public unrest, the dependent rebate is set to be reinstated. The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) will administer the dependent rebate as remaining in existence from 1 January 2024.
