# Papua New Guinea
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Employment expenses
Salary or wage earners receive a 25% rebate for allowable deductions to the extent of any salary or wages tax paid during an income year.
## Business deductions
In PNG taxation law, there are general deductions and specific deductions.
Under the general deduction provision, all losses and expenditures, to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing that income, are allowable deductions. This is except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private, or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income.
Specific deductions include:
## Personal deductions
Expenditures of a private nature, such as dental or medical costs, are neither deductible nor subject to rebate or credit.
## Personal allowances
In Papua New Guinea, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (s*ee Dependant rebates in the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*).
## Losses
Tax losses incurred in an income year may be carried forward for utilisation in future income years for a maximum of seven years. Losses derived in earning foreign income are quarantined and are therefore not allowable as deductions against PNG-sourced income.
Capital losses are not deductible.
