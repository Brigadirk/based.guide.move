## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Bermuda residency may be granted to non-Bermudians in the form of a work permit. Note that it is illegal to work in Bermuda without a work permit.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in levels of persons working remotely, the government of Bermuda introduced the Work from Bermuda Certificate, allowing certain persons and students to work and study remotely from Bermuda with a temporary 'permit', which must be reapplied for annually.
