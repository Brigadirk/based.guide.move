## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
Since Bermuda did not previously impose income taxes on corporations, income determination has not historically been relevant in the context of Bermuda taxation.
However, the Bermuda CITA 2023, provides specific guidelines for income determination applicable to the Bermuda CIT which is effective in 2025 for Bermuda businesses within its scope. Corporate taxable income is generally based on book income, with adjustments for certain transactions and credits.
