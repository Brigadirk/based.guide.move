## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
Branch income is taxed at the same rate as that of local corporations and on a similar basis. The transfer of profits to its overseas head office is subject to a withholding tax (WHT) of 33⅓% or at a lower treaty rate, where applicable.
A branch operation, irrespective of the nature of its business activities, is subject to Jamaican income tax on income derived by the branch from the island and elsewhere. In computing the income for tax purposes, expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the branch's trade are deductible, including a reasonable proportion of head office expenses.
Taxable profits derived by the branch from transactions between the branch and affiliates should be computed at arm's-length values.
