# Jamaica
## Overview
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
The official language of Jamaica is English, and the currency is the Jamaican dollar (JMD).
Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes. Its capital is Kingston, located on the south coast of the island. Other major cities and towns include Montego Bay, Spanish Town, Port Antonio, Ocho Rios, Mandeville, and Negril. Although small in size, Jamaica boasts a rich and unique culture, and many Jamaicans (e.g. Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Marcus Garvey, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and Usain Bolt) have made an indelible impact in the fields of music, politics, religion, and sports worldwide.
The principal drivers of the Jamaican economy are tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness, energy, business process outsourcing, and bauxite/alumina. The country also relies heavily on remittances from citizens living and employed overseas.
The last two decades have seen significant improvements in the country's infrastructure, including several tolled highways and by-passes, which have enhanced road access within the island. Its major airports are Norman Manley International in Kingston and Sangster International in Montego Bay (both of which have seen significant modernisation and improvements) as well as a smaller third international airport, Ian Fleming Airport located in Boscobel, Saint Mary, which is near Ocho Rios.
The principal seaports are Kingston and Montego Bay. There are also extensive cruise shipping facilities in Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, Falmouth, and Port Antonio. The Port of Kingston is located on the world's seventh largest natural harbour, at the centre of the north-south and east-west axes through the Caribbean, approximately 32 miles from the trade routes passing through the Panama Canal.
Jamaica's telecommunication system has also grown significantly in the last decade and is now one of the most sophisticated in the Caribbean. Jamaica's advanced telecoms infrastructure utilises a hybrid of fixed-line and wireless technologies, including 3G and 4G broadband networks.
