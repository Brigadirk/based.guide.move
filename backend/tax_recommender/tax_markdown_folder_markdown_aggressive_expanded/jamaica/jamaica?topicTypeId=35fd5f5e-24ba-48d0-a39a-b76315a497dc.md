## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
In general, Jamaican residents and domiciled individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-resident individuals are taxed on Jamaican-sourced income. A non-Jamaican domiciled individual is generally not taxable on foreign-sourced income unless one remits this to Jamaica. Notwithstanding this, a non-domiciled individual working in Jamaica is taxed on the compensation attributable to services rendered in and in relation to Jamaica (subject to certain exceptions) as well as Jamaican-sourced income.
## Personal income tax rates
Individuals are generally liable to income tax at the rate of 25% on their chargeable income (not exceeding JMD 6 million *per annum*) less an annual tax-free threshold (where applicable). Chargeable income derived in excess of JMD 6 million *per annum* is subject to income tax at a rate of 30%.
An annual tax-free threshold of JMD 1,500,096 is available to Jamaican tax-resident individual taxpayers (JMD 1,700,088 *per annum* with effect from 1 April 2024).
## Local income taxes
Tax is imposed on individuals at the national level. Income tax is not separately imposed at the local level.
