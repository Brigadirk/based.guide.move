## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
A company is treated as a resident of Indonesia for tax purposes by virtue of having its establishment or its place of management in Indonesia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under the Income Tax Law, a non-resident company may be treated as having a taxable presence if it runs a business or conducts activities in Indonesia, which can be in the form of:
Domestic regulation on PE also acknowledges the concept adopted under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations (UN) Commentaries that under the operation of a tax treaty a business form that is used by a foreign subject to carry on only ‘preparatory or auxiliary’ activity in Indonesia will not create a PE.
Where the non-resident company is resident in a country that has a tax treaty with Indonesia, the rules on a PE creation may be changed; usually there is a longer ‘time test’ for certain activities performed in Indonesia.
