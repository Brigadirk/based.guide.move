Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 6 April to the following 5 April.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are issued shortly after the end of the tax year and must be filed before the following 6 October, disclosing total income and any claims for reliefs and allowances for the relevant tax year. Fixed penalties are applied if a return is filed late.
A married couple or civil partnership can elect to file a joint income tax return and are jointly and severally liable for any tax liability.
## Payment of tax
An employee’s tax and national insurance contributions are deducted by the employer under the 'Income Tax Instalment Payments' (ITIP) system, with the employer paying the amounts deducted to the Assessor of Taxes each month.
A self-employed individual is required to make a payment on account of their tax and national insurance liability on 6 January in the year of assessment.
An assessment showing the final tax and national insurance liability is issued after the end of the year, and any balance owing is due on 6 January following the end of the year of assessment. Interest is payable on tax paid late.
