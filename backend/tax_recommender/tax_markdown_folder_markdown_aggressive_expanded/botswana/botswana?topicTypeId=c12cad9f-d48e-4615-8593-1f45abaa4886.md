## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
Botswana has a source-based taxation system.
CIT is charged at a single flat rate of 22%. Manufacturing companies having the approval from the Minister of Finance for a special tax rate will be charged at the rate of 15%.
## International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) profits
IFSC companies are currently taxed at the rate of 15% on income arising from approved financial transactions with non-residents, IFSC companies, and Specified Collective Investment Undertakings. All other income is taxable at the rate of 22%. Companies must apply for a certificate to be classified as IFSC companies, which deal only in specified services with qualified persons.
## Mining profits
Mining profits, other than profits from diamond mining, are taxed according to the following formula:
Annual tax rate = 70 minus (1,500/x), where x is taxable income as a percentage of gross income.
The tax rate shall not be less than the flat CIT rate of 22%.
### Diamond mining
Diamond mining is usually taxed in terms of an agreement with the government of Botswana.
## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial government taxes on income in Botswana.
