## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
## Taxable period
Botswana has a fiscal year ending on 30 June.
## Tax returns
All individuals are separately taxed (i.e. separate filing of returns by a husband and wife is required). All individuals need to submit a tax return unless the annual income is less than the tax threshold of BWP 48,000 for resident individuals. The tax return is due for submission on or before 30 September.
## Payment of tax
A PAYE system, under which income tax is withheld from remuneration payable (including non-cash benefits) to employees, is in operation.
