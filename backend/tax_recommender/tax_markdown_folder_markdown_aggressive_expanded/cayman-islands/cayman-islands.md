# Cayman Islands
## Overview
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
With no direct taxation, the islands are a thriving offshore financial centre. More than 99,000 active companies were registered in the Cayman Islands as of 2016, including almost 300 banks, 750 insurers, and 10,500 mutual funds. A stock exchange was opened in 1997. The tourism and financial services industries create a significant majority of gross domestic product (GDP).
