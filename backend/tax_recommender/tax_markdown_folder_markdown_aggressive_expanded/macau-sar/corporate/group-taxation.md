# Macau SAR
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
There is no provision for group taxation in Macau SAR.
## Transfer pricing
A taxpayer that is considered the ultimate parent entity of an MNE would be classified as a Group A taxpayer and would be required to maintain proper books and records for tax filing purposes. An ultimate parent entity would be required to fulfil the Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) filing obligation if the total revenue in its consolidated financial statements for the past financial year exceeds a certain threshold (currently set at MOP 7 billion). The CbCR will be exchanged with other tax jurisdictions through automatic tax information exchange under the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.
## Thin capitalisation
There is no thin capitalisation provision in the Macau tax regime.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in the Macau tax regime.
