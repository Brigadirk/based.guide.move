# Macau SAR
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Residence and/or domicile are irrelevant for Macau Professional Tax purposes.
A taxpayer who is a resident of a country with which Macau SAR has a bilateral tax agreement or tax arrangement will have to refer to the relevant article of such agreement/arrangement to determine one’s liability to professional tax. *See the [Foreign tax relief and tax treaties](foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties.html) section for a list of countries with which Macau SAR has a bilateral tax agreement or tax arrangement*.
