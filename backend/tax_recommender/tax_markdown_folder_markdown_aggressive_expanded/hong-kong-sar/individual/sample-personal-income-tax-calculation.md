## Individual - Sample personal income tax calculation
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Below is a sample salaries tax computation for year of assessment 2024/25 for illustrative purposes.
Assumptions:
| Salaries tax computation | HKD | HKD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Salaries | 650,000 |  |
| Bonus | 50,000 |  |
| Total assessable income |  | 700,000 |
| **Less: Concessionary deductions** |  |  |
| Charitable donations | (3,000) |  |
| Retirement scheme contributions | (18,000) | (21,000) |
| Net income |  | 679,000 |
| **Less: Allowances** |  |  |
| Married person’s allowance | (264,000) |  |
| Child allowances (HKD 130,000 x 2) | (260,000) | (524,000) |
| Net chargeable income |  | 155,000 |
| **Tax at progressive rates:** |  |  |
| First HKD 50,000 @ 2% | 1,000 |  |
| Next HKD 50,000 @ 6% | 3,000 |  |
| Next HKD 50,000 @ 10% | 5,000 |  |
| Remainder HKD 5,000 @ 14% | 700 |  |
| **Tax payable (1)** |  | **9,700** |
Note
1. The tax amount calculated based on the standard rate (i.e. HKD 679,000 @15% = HKD 101,850) is higher than that computed at progressive rates so the standard rate would not apply. Tax reduction for the year of assessment 2024/25 (if any) has not yet been announced.
