# Hong Kong SAR
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Foreign tax credits
For foreign taxes payable/paid by a Hong Kong tax resident on specified foreign-sourced income deemed taxable under the refined FSIE regime, foreign tax credits are available irrespective of whether or not the foreign taxes are paid in a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR. Taxpayers are also required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR.
## Foreign investment incentives
Hong Kong SAR does not have any specific incentives for foreign investment, except that offshore funds may be exempt from profits tax under certain circumstances.
