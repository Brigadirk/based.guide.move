# Armenia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
There are no group taxation provisions available in Armenia.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing regulations entered into force on 1 January 2020. It defines the concept of transfer pricing, methods, comparability factors, documentation procedures, and sources of information about uncontrolled and controlled transactions.
### Overview of the transfer pricing regulations
Transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between related parties that are controlled and if the amount of all controlled transactions carried out by the taxpayer during the tax year exceeds AMD 200 million (net of VAT, excise tax, and environmental tax).
The tax authorities check the compliance of controlled transactions with the principle of market relations, as well as the completeness of the calculation and payment of CIT and payment for the use of mineral resources (royalty).
If the amount of all controlled transactions during the tax year exceeds the threshold of AMD 200 million, the taxpayer must submit a notification of controlled transactions to the tax authorities no later than 20 April of the year following the tax period.
Taxpayers must submit documentation on control transactions to the tax authority within 30 working days from the date of receipt of the written notification.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
CbC reporting requirements entered into force on 1 January 2024, and the regulation is applicable to tax years beginning 1 January 2025. CbC reporting is mandated by the parent organisation of a multinational corporation if its gross income exceeds 750 million euros (EUR) based on the previous tax year's results. Generally, CbC reporting in Armenia includes the following:
Taxpayers must submit CbC reporting to the tax authority immediately after the end of each tax year, within a 12-month period.
## Thin capitalisation
Armenia does not have thin capitalisation rules. However, there are certain limitations on deductibility of interest expenses (*see Interest expenses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Armenia.
