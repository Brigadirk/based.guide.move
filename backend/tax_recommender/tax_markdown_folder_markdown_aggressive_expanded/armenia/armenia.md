Armenia declared independence on 21 September 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Armenia is made up of 11 provinces, with Yerevan as the capital, and has a presidential republic form of government. The official language is Armenian, although Russian is also widely used. The currency of Armenia is the dram (AMD).
