## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
The Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) taxes residents on their worldwide income.
Individuals resident in Côte d’Ivoire are subject to specific direct income tax, depending on the kind of revenue earned.
## Personal income tax rates
### Tax on salaries and wages
Taxes on salaries and wages, pensions, and life annuities payable by employees have been reformed through Ordinance No. 2023-718 of 13 September 2023. The broad outlines of these reforms are as follows:
### Progressive tax scale by salary bracket
The tax on salaries and wages is now calculated on the gross amount of the salary and according to a monthly progressive scale per bracket to which a determined rate is applied. This scale allows the gross tax to be calculated as follows:
| Monthly income brackets (XOF\*) | | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | Not over |
| 0 | 75,000 | 0 |
| 75,000 | 240,000 | 16 |
| 240,000 | 800,000 | 21 |
| 800,000 | 2,400,000 | 24 |
| 2,400,000 | 8,000,000 | 28 |
| 8,000,000 |  | 32 |
The formula to apply to directly obtain the amount of the monthly gross tax is as follows:
R = Taxable income
| Taxable monthly salary bracket (XOF) | Gross tax amount |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 75,000 | 0 |
| 75,001 to 240,000 | R x 16% - 12,000 |
| 240,001 to 800,000 | R x 21% - 24,000 |
| 800,001 to 2,400,000 | R x 24% - 48,000 |
| 2,400,001 to 8,000,000 | R x 28% - 144,000 |
| Above 8,000,000 | R x 32% - 464,000 |
