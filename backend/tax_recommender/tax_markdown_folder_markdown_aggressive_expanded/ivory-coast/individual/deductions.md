# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Employment expenses
Deduction for employment expenses has been abolish by the reform of tax on salaries and wages and is replaced by the tax reduction measure for family expenses (*see below*).
## Personal deductions
Although the deduction of specific non-business expenses is permitted under tax law, the practice rarely is used since the results usually are less favourable than the result from taking the the tax reduction measure for family expenses (*see below*).
## Standard deductions
The standard deduction was removed under the reform of tax on salaries and wages.
## Personal allowances
### Tax reduction scale for dependants (RICF)
The reform of tax on salaries and wages provides for a tax reduction to take into account family responsibilities (RICF) to replace the family quotient system provided for by the previous device.
The tax reduction scale for dependants is as follows:
| Number of shares | Tax reduction scale for dependants (XOF monthly amount) |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 0 |
| 1.5 | 5,500 |
| 2.0 | 11,000 |
| 2.5 | 16,500 |
| 3.0 | 22,000 |
| 3.5 | 27,500 |
| 4.0 | 33,000 |
| 4.5 | 38,500 |
| 5.0 | 44,000 |
Retired people aged over 70 benefit from reduction of 75% of the calculated tax after application of the tax reduction for family responsibilities.
The number of shares to be taken into account for the determination of the tax reduction for family responsibilities is fixed as follows:
| Marital status | Number of shares |
| --- | --- |
| Single, divorced, or widower without dependent children | 1.0 |
| Married without dependent children | 2.0 |
| Single or divorced, having a dependent child | 2.0 |
| Married or widowed with a dependent child | 2.5 |
| Single or divorced, having two dependent children | 2.5 |
| Married or widowed with two dependent children | 3.0 |
| Single or divorced, having three dependent children | 3.0 |
| Married or widowed with three dependent children | 3.5 |
| Single or divorced, having four dependent children | 3.5 |
The number of shares is increased by one half point per dependent child. This increase is increased to one point per dependent minor or adult infirm.
However, the number of shares to take into consideration for the reduction of the tax may in no case exceed five.
