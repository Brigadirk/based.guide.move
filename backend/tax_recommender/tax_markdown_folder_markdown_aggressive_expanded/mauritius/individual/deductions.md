The relief shall apply in respect of a loan secured by mortgage or fixed charge on immovable property taken on or after 1 July 2006.
In the case of a couple where neither spouse is a dependent spouse, the relief shall, at the spouses’ option, be divided equally for each spouse.

Unauthorised deductions include all expenditure of a capital, domestic, or private nature; expenditure relating to exempt income; all taxes; any reserve or provision (e.g. reserve for doubtful debts); gifts and donations; and entertainment expenses.
