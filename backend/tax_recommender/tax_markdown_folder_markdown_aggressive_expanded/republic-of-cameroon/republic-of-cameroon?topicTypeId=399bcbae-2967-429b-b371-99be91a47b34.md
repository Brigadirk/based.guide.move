The rate of the Common External Tariff (CET) has been re-established on some products, such as rice and cement. As such, the import of rice, which previously benefitted from the suspension of duties and taxes, is henceforth subject to the CET at the rate of 5%, and the CET rate has been revised upwards for some types of cement.
There is an African Integration Contribution (AIC) at the rate of 0.2% applicable to the taxable value of goods imported from third party countries into the African Union.
The ceiling of the computer fee, which rate is 0.45%, shall be fixed at XAF 15,000 per export declaration.
