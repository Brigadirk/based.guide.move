## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
Personal gross income is made up of the following categories of income:
The assessment of taxable income in each of these categories is governed by its own special rules.
## Employment income
For employment income, the basis of assessment is the gross amount of all wages, pensions, salaries, and annuities, as well as benefits in kind or in cash granted to the person concerned.
However, a wide range of allowances are exempted from taxation. They are, *inter alia*, special allowances to cover inherent duty and services expenses, family allowances and benefits, benefits paid by any state authority by virtue of the law, scholarships, temporary allowances, and benefits and life annuities paid to victims of industrial accidents and other rightful claimants.
Benefits in kind are assessed as follows on the basis of the taxable income:
Benefits in kind not listed are estimated at their actual cost.
Any cash allowance representing benefits in kind shall be included in the basis of assessment for its actual amount, unless they are specifically exempted by a contrary provision.
Vacation fare for expatriate workers and their family is not taxable.
## Income from stocks and shares
Income from stocks and shares includes:
Income from stocks and shares are taxed at an overall rate of 16.5%.
As of January 2014, interest on loans contracted abroad and of a maturity period of at least seven years shall be exempted from personal income tax. The exemption is applicable only to agreements signed from 1 January 2014 onwards.
Where transfer is realised abroad, the Cameroonian law enterprise and the transferor shall be jointly and severally liable to payment of the sums due under such transfer.

## Profits from agriculture
Income earned by farmers, share-croppers, smallholders, or by the actual owners of agricultural undertakings is deemed to be profits of agriculture for the assessment of PIT.
The rules governing the assessment of the taxable basis are the same as those applicable to handicraft, industrial, and commercial profits.
## Non-commercial profits
Non-commercial profits include all earnings from liberal professions, from public offices and trusts held by persons without commercial status, from non-salaried income of sportsmen and artists, and from all operations, gainful activities, and other sources of income unconnected with the above categories of income.
The members of liberal professions are subject to the system of actual earnings regardless of the amount of their turnover.
