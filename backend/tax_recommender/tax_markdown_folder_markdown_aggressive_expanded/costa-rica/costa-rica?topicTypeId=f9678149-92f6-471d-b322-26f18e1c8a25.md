### **Value-added tax (VAT)**
The VAT Law, law number 6826 establishes some exemptions to the VAT, for example:
Assets sell overseas and related operations, as well as the provision of services abroad.
### **Selective consumption tax**
The selective consumption tax may be applied at a rate of up to 100% and is levied on goods that are considered non-essential.
## Property tax
## Real estate transfer tax
Real estate transfer tax is calculated as 1.5% of the selling price of the real estate or its property tax value, whichever is greater. The tax is triggered by the direct sale of the real estate or through the indirect transfer of real estate when there is a modification in the control of the entity holding the real estate.
