# Costa Rica
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 15 January 2025
## Taxable period
Income Tax Law, Law number 7092 established, the fiscal period will match the calendar year, but there will be special cases in which the taxpayers may request the approval of a fiscal period different than the calendar year.
## Tax returns
## Payment of tax
Employees who receive salaries and other similar or complementary remunerations or benefits must pay a monthly income tax that is withheld by the employer from the monthly payroll. Individuals do not need to file an annual tax return for this type of income.
Self-employed individuals are required to make instalments of estimated taxes, which are computed on the average of the last three fiscal years, and a final payment two and a half months after the end of the fiscal year.
The amounts paid can be treated as paid in account at the moment when the taxpayers file the income tax return to the tax authorities at the end of the fiscal period.
