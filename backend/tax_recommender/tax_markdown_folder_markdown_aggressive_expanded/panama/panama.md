# Panama
## Overview
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Panama, a country in Central America, is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the south, and the Caribbean Sea to the north. Panama became independent in 1903 and is a constitutional democracy. The country is divided into ten administrative provinces, with Panama City as the capital. The official language of Panama is Spanish (although English is also widely spoken). The official currency in Panama is the balboa (PAB). Since the balboa exists in the form of coins only, Panama uses United States dollars (USD) for all its paper currency. The US dollar and the balboa have the same value in Panama and can be used interchangeably, with no exchange restrictions.
Panama's economy is mainly based on a well-developed service sector heavily weighted towards banking, commerce, tourism, trading, and private industries because of its key geographic location.
The expansion of the Panama Canal, combined with other huge infrastructure, is expected to boost and extend economic expansion in Panama for some time.
Regarding GDP, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Panama (INEC), the Panamanian economy reached a GDP (in nominal terms) of PAB 76,522.5 million during the year 2022, with a growth rate of 13.5% compared to the previous year, which corresponds to an increase of PAB 9,115.8 million.
The INEC also mentions that the internal activities that presented a positive performance in this period were: construction, commercial activities, manufacturing industries, electricity, real estate and business, artistic, entertainment and recreational activities, and other personal services; while education registered a decrease. Among the added values generated by activities related to the rest of the world, the following presented increases: The Panama Canal, port services, air transport, and the Colon Free Zone. Furthermore, the income generated by the activities of mines and quarries related to the export of copper and its concentrates decreased; also, some agricultural exports decreased.
