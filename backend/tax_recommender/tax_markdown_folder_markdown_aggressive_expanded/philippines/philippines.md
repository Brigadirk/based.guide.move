## Overview
Last reviewed - 01 August 2024
The Philippines is strategically located off the southeastern coast of mainland Asia, with a flying time of four hours or less to most major Asian countries. Its strategic location allowed it to bridge Eastern and Western cultures, producing a rich history of Asian, European, and American influences. The Philippines has been counted as the third-largest English-speaking country in the world. The capital of the Philippines is Manila, and the currency is the Philippine peso (PHP).
The Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) posted a growth rate of 5.6% in 2023. The main contributors to the growth, with their corresponding increases, were: wholesale and retail trade, as well as repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, at 5.5%; financial and insurance activities at 8.9%; and construction at 8.8%. Major economic sectors, namely: agriculture, forestry, and fishing (AFF); industry; and services, all posted positive growths of 1.2%, 3.6%, and 7.2%, respectively.
