## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Unless impracticable, a husband and wife must file one consolidated income tax return, but the tax is computed separately. Income that cannot be definitely attributed or identified as exclusive income of either spouse is divided equally between them. Generally, this results in lower combined tax liability than when the tax is jointly computed.
Substituted filing is available for qualified employees. In such case, the Certificate of Compensation Payment/Tax Withheld (BIR Form 2316) filed by the employer and duly stamped 'received' by the BIR shall be tantamount to substituted filing of the Annual Income Tax Return of the employees.
Substituted filing shall apply only to employees who meet all of the following conditions:
Substituted filing, however, will not apply to non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines.
All individual taxpayers who do not qualify for substituted filing are required to file their returns on a calendar-year basis. The return must be filed on or before 15 April of the succeeding year.
## Payment of tax
Generally, the income tax withheld from the salaries or compensation of aliens, resident or not, should equal their final tax liability on such compensation. If not, the balance must be paid at the time the annual return is filed. However, if the tax due exceeds PHP 2,000, income tax liability may be paid in two equal instalments. The first instalment is due on 15 April while the second and final instalment is due on 15 October.
Any payment of the remaining tax liability beyond the due date shall be subject to certain penalties.
