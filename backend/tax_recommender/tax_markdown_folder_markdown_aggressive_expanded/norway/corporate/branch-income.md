## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
Branch income is taxed at the corporate rate of 22% (25% for certain entities within the financial sector), i.e. the same as Norwegian companies. The basis for taxation is gross income less deductible costs. Both direct and indirect costs related to the activities carried out in Norway may be deductible.
There is no branch profit tax or other repatriation taxes. However, if assets and/or liabilities are transferred from a PE in Norway to the head office or another foreign PE of the same company, this may trigger exit taxation. The transfer of assets to another corporate entity is subject to regular taxation.
