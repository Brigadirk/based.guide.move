## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
WHT is to be withheld and remitted to the state budget by entities paying income to non-residents if these entities qualify under a tax agent definition (i.e. by [i] Uzbek legal entities and [ii] non-residents operating in Uzbekistan via PE).
Income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends, interest, and royalties) is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate as provided by the tax treaty (with certain exemptions), provided that there is a duly formalised tax certificate issued by a competent authority confirming that non-residents are registered for tax purposes in the state with which Uzbekistan has the effective tax treaty.
The domestic WHT rates are as follows:
| Payment | WHT (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends and interest to residents | 5 |
| Dividends and interest to non-residents | 10 |
| Insurance and reinsurance payments | 10 |
| Freight | 6 |
| Royalties, services (including management, consulting services), rents, other income | 20 |
## Double taxation treaty (DTT) relief
Foreign legal entities that do not carry on activities in Uzbekistan through a PE are subject to WHT on income from sources in Uzbekistan, subject to the terms of a relevant DTT. Uzbekistan has enforced DTTs with 55 countries.
DTTs in force establish WHT rates as follows:
| Recipient | WHT (%) | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividends | Interest | Royalties |
| Austria | 5 (2b)/15 | 0 (7c, 7e, 7f)/10 | 5 |
