## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
Both residents and non-residents are subject to tax in Uzbekistan. Residents are taxed on their worldwide income; non-residents are taxed on income from sources in Uzbekistan.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
The PIT rates are as follows:
| Taxable income | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Employment income, rent income, capital gains, etc. | 12 |
| Dividends and interest for residents | 5 |
Personal income of non-resident individuals from sources in Uzbekistan is taxed at the following withholding rates:
| Taxable income | Tax rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends and interest | 10 |
| Transportation (freight) services | 6 |
| Other income (including royalty, employment income, etc.) | 12 |
The PIT rate charged on Uzbek-sourced income of non-residents (except for dividends, interest, and income from freight) was reduced from 20% to 12% by virtue of Presidential Resolution.
For the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2028, income of individuals (both residents and non-residents of the Republic of Uzbekistan) in the form of dividends from shares in joint stock companies is exempt from PIT.
## Local income taxes
There are no local personal income taxes in Uzbekistan.
