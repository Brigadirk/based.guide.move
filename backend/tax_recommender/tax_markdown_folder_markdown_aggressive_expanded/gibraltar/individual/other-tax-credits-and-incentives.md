## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Tax credits and allowances for ordinarily residents
Persons will be able to claim a tax credit on the following items:
A separate application for the gym/personal trainer and private school tuition tax credit will need to be made to the Income Tax Office along with proof of payment. The tax credit is not an allowance and will not be reflected in a person's tax code. It will only be reflected in a person's assessment.
Regarding the tax credit for LSRA fees, details of the application process are yet to be published.
## Category 2 tax incentives
A Category 2 individual shall only be liable to income tax on the first GBP 118,000 of income *per annum* under the Allowances Based System (on income of GBP 105,000, this equates to a total tax charge of GBP 42,380). The minimum amount of tax payable in any tax year is GBP 37,000.
In order to be issued with a Category 2 certificate, an individual must:
## High executive possessing specialist skills (HEPSS) tax incentives
A HEPSS individual shall only be liable to income tax on the first GBP 160,000 of income *per annum* under the Gross Income Based System (on income of GBP 160,000, this equates to a total tax charge of GBP 39,940).
In order to be issued with a HEPSS certificate, an individual must:
## Green incentives
A one-off tax deduction is introduced against assessable income (with the percentage to be verified and subject to the discretion of the Commissioner of Income Tax) on the investment made by an individual, company, or business that makes a significant improvement to the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of the premises.
## Property investment incentive
A tax-free property investment incentive is available for owners of property constructed in Gibraltar in the next 30 months from 1 July 2016 and rented for residential purposes. These owners will receive a tax credit equal to the tax payable on the profits earned on the first 24 months of rent occurring in the first five years after the completion of construction of that property. This tax credit is non-refundable and can be offset against the tax payable to extinguish any liability to tax.
