## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Belgian accounting law provides for the following four methods of inventory valuation: the method based on the individualisation of the price of each item, the method based on the weighted average prices, the last in first out (LIFO) method, and the first in first out (FIFO) method. All of these methods are accepted for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to the normal CIT rate. For tax purposes, a capital gain is defined as the positive difference between the sale price less the costs related to the disposal of the asset and the original cost of the acquisition or investment less the depreciations and write-offs that have been deducted for tax purposes.
Capital gains realised on tangible fixed assets and intangible assets could be subject to a deferred and spread taxation regime, provided that certain conditions are met.
### Capital gains on shares
Net capital gains on shares are fully exempt provided that the subject-to-tax condition, the one-year holding period, and the participation condition are fulfilled. The conditions to benefit from the capital gains exemption are, as such, entirely aligned with the conditions to benefit from the DRD. Indeed, the participation condition implies a minimum participation threshold of at least 10% or an acquisition value of at least EUR 2.5 million in the share capital of the company concerned.
The tax rate amounts to 25% if either the subject-to-tax condition, the one-year holding period, or the participation condition is not met.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Belgian company are first included in its taxable basis on a gross basis when the dividends are received from a Belgian company or on a net basis (i.e. after deduction of the foreign WHT) when they are received from a foreign company.
Provided certain conditions are met, 100% of the dividend income can be offset by a DRD.
### Dividends-received deduction (DRD)
A DRD of 100% of dividend income can be applied under certain conditions (*see below*). Any unused portion of the DRD from dividends received from a European Economic Area (EEA) subsidiary or a subsidiary from a country with which Belgium has concluded a DTT with a non‑discrimination clause on dividends can be carried forward to future tax years (taking into account the possible limitations introduced by the basket). The same also applies for dividends from Belgian subsidiaries.
The DRD is subject to a (i) minimum participation condition and (ii) taxation condition.
In addition, based on a rule against hybrid instruments, dividends received by the parent company will no longer be tax exempt whenever the distributed profit is tax deductible in the jurisdiction of the subsidiary (e.g. hybrid loans). Further, as a result of a general anti-abuse rule (GAAR), the DRD will be denied whenever the dividends originate from legal acts or a whole of legal acts that are artificial (i.e. no valid business reasons that reflect economic reality) and merely in place to obtain the DRD exemption.
### Minimum participation condition
According to the minimum participation condition, the recipient company must have, at the moment of attribution, a participation of at least 10% or an acquisition value of at least EUR 2.5 million in the capital of the distributing company. The beneficiary of the dividend must have been holding the full legal ownership of the underlying shares for at least one year prior to the dividend distribution or commit to hold it for a minimum of one year.
### Taxation condition
The taxation condition, in summary, means that the dividend income received must have been subject to tax at the level of the distributing company and its subsidiaries if the former redistributes dividends received.
The taxation condition is based on seven ‘exclusion’ rules and certain exceptions to these rules. Basically, the exclusion rules apply to the following:
While this is a summary of the exclusion rules, numerous exceptions to these exclusion rules exist and need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis.
### Bonus shares (stock dividends)
Distribution of bonus shares to shareholders in compensation for an increase of the share capital by incorporation of existing reserves is, in principle, tax free. The situation may be different if the shareholder has the choice between a cash or stock dividend.
## Interest, rents, and royalties
Interest that accrued, became receivable by, or was received by a company, and rents and royalties received by a company, are characterised as business profits and taxed at the general CIT rate of 25%. The income can be offset against available tax assets.
## Foreign income
A foreign tax credit may be available for foreign royalty income and foreign interest income. *See the [Tax credits and incentives](belgium/corporate/tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section for more information*.
Undistributed income of subsidiaries, whether or not they are foreign, is subject to Belgian income tax in the hands of the Belgian corporate shareholder if certain conditions are met (*see Controlled foreign companies [CFCs] in the [Group taxation](belgium/corporate/group-taxation.html) section*).
