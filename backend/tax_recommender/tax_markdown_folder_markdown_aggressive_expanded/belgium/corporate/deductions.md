## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
As a general rule, expenses are tax deductible in Belgium if they are incurred in order to maintain or to increase taxable income, they are incurred or have accrued during the taxable period concerned, and evidence of the reality and the amount of such expenses is provided by the taxpayer.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of an asset is tax deductible to the extent that it results from a devaluation of the asset, and the devaluation effectively occurred during the taxable period concerned. The depreciation methods that are accepted by Belgian tax law are the straight-line method (linear method) and, in the past, the double-declining balance method. In the latter case, the annual depreciation may not exceed 40% of the acquisition value.
Depreciation rates are based on the expected lifetime of the assets concerned, which are normally agreed upon by the taxpayer with the tax authorities. However, for certain assets, rates are set by administrative instructions as follows:
| Assets | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Commercial buildings | 3 |
| Industrial buildings | 5 |
| Machinery and equipment (depending on the type) | 20 or 33 |
| Rolling stock | 20 |
Intangible fixed assets must be amortised over a period of at least five years for tax purposes (except R&D expenses, for which the minimum amortisation period is three years).
For the year of acquisition of an asset, only the proportionate share of an annual depreciation calculation can be accepted as depreciation for income tax purposes (in principle to be computed on a daily basis). The same rule applies for acquisition-related costs, such as registration duties and notary fees due upon a purchase of real estate, but SMEs can opt to fully deduct these costs in the year of the acquisition.
## Goodwill
Belgian accounting and tax laws allow amortisation of goodwill arising at the occasion of an asset deal. For Belgian tax purposes, the amortisation period, which depends on the elements included in the goodwill, is a minimum of five years, and the straight-line method must be applied. According to the Minister of Finance, '*clientele*' (client lists) should be amortised over a period of 10 to 12 years. The aforesaid accounting and tax amortisation for goodwill is not available if tax-free mergers or de-mergers occur (i.e. they, among other things, follow the continuity principle from an accounting perspective).
## Start-up expenses
Incorporation costs, at the election of the taxpayer, may be deducted fully in the year of incorporation or can be depreciated over a maximum period of five years.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are, in principle, tax deductible insofar as thin capitalisation/30% EBITDA limits are respected (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*) and the interest is at an arm’s-length rate.
## Provisions and bad debt reserves
Provisions and bad debt reserves are tax deductible provided that:
Provisions for risks and charges are only deductible for tax purposes if:
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions may not be less than EUR 40 and may not exceed 5% of the total net income of the taxable period, with a maximum of EUR 500,000 to be tax deductible. The law includes an exhaustive list of gifts that are deductible, including gifts in cash to certain social, cultural, or scientific organisations.
## Car costs
### Current rules
As of 2020, the deductibility of car costs and fuel costs is calculated based on the following formula: 120 – (0.5 x coefficient x number of grams CO2/km), whereby the coefficient equals:
The maximum deductibility percentage is limited to 100% and the minimum amounts to 50% (or 40% if the grams CO2/km are at least 200 gm/km).
Special rules apply to plug-in hybrid cars, with a distinction as to whether they were bought or leased after 31 December 2017.
### Future rules
As of 2026 onwards, only zero-emission company cars will be able to benefit from a tax deduction. Zero-emission company cars purchased before 1 January 2027 will remain 100% tax deductible. For zero-emission cars purchased after this date, this percentage will be gradually reduced to 67.5% by 2031. For polluting cars (i.e. any car with a CO2-emission higher than 0g/100km) purchased before 1 July 2023, the current tax regime will remain unchanged. For polluting cars purchased after 1 July 2023, a cool-down period is foreseen whereby the deduction will be gradually reduced to zero by 2028.
As for the deduction of fuel costs, a maximum deduction of 50% for the costs related to fossil fuel will be introduced if the car is purchased or leased as from 2023. Electricity for powering the vehicle will continue to be tax deductible at 100%.
Investments in public charging stations made by companies during certain periods are incentivised by allowing an increased tax deduction:
## Taxes, fines, and penalties
The following taxes and penalties are not tax deductible in Belgium (non-exhaustive list):
Immovable WHT (i.e. real estate tax) and foreign taxes, however, are considered as tax deductible.
## Disallowed expenses
The following expenses are not tax deductible in Belgium (this list is not exhaustive):
## Net operating losses
### Principle: Carried forward without limitation in time
### Change of control
If a change of control of a Belgian company takes place (e.g. if the shares of the company are transferred and along with them the majority of the voting rights), the amount of tax losses, investment deduction, NID carried forward, IID carried forward, and DRD carried forward available in that company (before the change of control) can no longer be offset against future profits unless the change can be justified by legitimate needs of a financial or economic nature in the hands of the loss realising company (i.e. evidence must be brought that the change is not purely tax driven).
A ruling can be requested from the Belgian tax authorities to obtain upfront certainty on the Belgian tax treatment of the contemplated operation and to ensure the losses are not forfeited as a result of a change of control.
### Tax-free merger or (partial) de-merger
If a tax-free merger or (partial) de-merger takes place, Belgian tax law provides for a partial transfer/maintenance of the rollover tax losses of the absorbed/absorbing company. The carried forward tax losses of the companies involved are then reduced based on the proportionate net fiscal value of the company (before the restructuring) compared to the sum of the net fiscal values of both the merging entities (before the restructuring). The current limited deduction of prior-year losses in the framework of a tax-neutral reorganisation also applies to the carried forward dividends-received deduction.
### Carryback
There is no tax loss carryback provision under Belgian tax law (except for the agriculture sector).
## Foreign PE losses
Foreign PE losses can only be deducted from the profits of the Belgian head office profits if certain conditions are fulfilled. As of 2020, the deduction has been limited to definite PE losses. In addition, the recapture rule only comes into play if the losses were set off in any taxable period against Belgian profits or against treaty-exempt profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Belgian company can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts are at arm's length. However, when such payments are made, either directly or indirectly, to a foreign affiliated person, entity, or PE that is not subject to tax or is subject to a tax regime that is notably more advantageous than the Belgian tax regime on such income, there is a reversal of the burden of proof. Such charges will be disallowed unless the Belgian company can prove that the transaction:
Fees, commissions, etc. paid to beneficiaries located in foreign countries and not properly reported, will, in principle, be subject to the secret commissions tax.
### Payments to tax havens
Companies subject to Belgian CIT or Belgian non-resident CIT that make direct or indirect payments to recipients established in tax havens at the time the payment is made are obligated to declare them if they are equal to or exceed EUR 100,000 during the tax year. The reporting must be made on a special form to be attached to the (non-resident) CIT return.
In the event of non-reporting, the payments will be disallowed expenses for CIT purposes. Where the payments have been reported duly and timely, their tax deductibility will be subject to the ability of the taxpayer to prove that (i) said payments were made as part of genuine, proper transactions and (ii) they were not made to an entity under an artificial construction.
A tax haven is defined as a jurisdiction:
The reporting concerns direct or indirect to payments made to:
