## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Federal government negotiations: expected tax reform
In the context of the federal government negotiations, a tax reform is anticipated following the elections held on 9 June 2024. Although proposals for adjustments to certain tax measures are being negotiated, in December 2024 no agreement has been reached yet.
## Changes to the Belgian transfer pricing documentation forms (Royal Decree of 16 June 2024, Official Gazette of 15 July 2024)
The Belgian administration has published adjusted transfer pricing documentation forms and guidance (Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country Reporting). The adjusted forms (275 LF, 275 MF and 275 CBC NOT) and explanatory notices were included in the Royal Decree dated 16 June 2024 and were published on 15 July 2024 in the Belgian Official Gazette. The adjusted forms will come into effect from financial years starting per 1 January 2025.
The most significant adjustments are on the form 275LF where transactions in Part B must be completed per country instead of aggregating the countries and the form 275CBC NOT where a notification can be the first notification, a change in the previous notification or a termination of the notification if the Belgian entity is no longer part of the Multinational group.
## Public CbC Reporting law of 8 January 2024 (Official Gazette of 26 January 2024) and Royal decree of 18 April 2024 (Official Gazette of 6 June 2024)
The Public CbC Reporting Directive has been implemented by the law of 8 January 2024 and the Royal decree of 18 April 2024.
Companies that fall in scope of the Belgian Public CbC Reporting law are: (i) Belgian (parent) companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 750 million and subject to income taxation in multiple jurisdictions as well as (ii) non-European parent companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 750 million that are economically active in Belgium through a subsidiary or branch and subject to the Belgian tax system.
Although the Belgian Public CbC Reporting law was generally drawn up to be consistent with the Directive, specific deviations include, among others:
It is important to bear in mind that CbC Report data will soon be publicly available as the first Belgian Public CbC Report must be published for financial years starting on or after 22 June 2024. Hence, the first Belgian Public CbC Report filing date is set at 21 June 2026 (31 December 2026 for companies with financial statements following the calendar year).
## Law of 12 May 2024 on various tax provisions (Official Gazette of 29 May 2024)
On 29 May 2024, the law of 12 May 2024 containing various tax provisions was published in the Belgian Official Gazette. This law implements several changes to the regime of the investment deduction and the innovation income deduction (IID).
The new regime is organised around three 'tracks':
The law provides for fixed investment deduction rates. Hence, going forward, these rates will no longer be subject to the yearly indexation mechanism.
A taxpayer can only choose one of the above-mentioned types of investment deduction per fixed asset.
The general conditions to benefit from the investment deduction remain the same.
The new regime, as well as the correction related to the (partial) professional withholding tax (WHT) exemption regime to determine the investment deduction basis, will be applicable for investments made as of 1 January 2025.
In addition, the law of 12 May 2024 provides for the following modifications to the IID and tax credit for innovation income:
