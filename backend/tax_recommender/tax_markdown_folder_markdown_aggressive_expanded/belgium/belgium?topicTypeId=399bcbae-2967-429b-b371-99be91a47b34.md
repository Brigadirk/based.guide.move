## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### Scope of VAT
The following transactions are subject to VAT in Belgium if they are considered to take place in Belgium:
### Intra-Community supply and intra-Community acquisition
An intra-Community supply of goods is a supply of goods whereby the goods are moving from one EU member state to another EU member state. In the member state of departure of the goods, the goods can be, under certain conditions, VAT exempt. As a result, the intra-Community acquisition of the goods (i.e. the arrival of the goods in the other member state) will be taxable.
### Standard and other VAT rates
The standard VAT rate is 21%. This rate applies to all goods and services not qualifying for one of the reduced VAT rates.
The following supplies of goods and services have a 12% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services have a 6% VAT rate:
The following supplies of goods and services are VAT exempt with credit (‘zero-rated’):
The following supplies of goods and services are, under certain conditions, VAT exempt without credit:
It should be noted that specific conditions may apply to the above two categories.
### VAT grouping
Under a VAT group, independent legal persons are treated as one single taxable person for VAT purposes if they are closely linked financially, economically, and organisationally. Hence, for VAT purposes, all supplies of goods and services to or by the group members are deemed to be made to or by the group itself.
The application of a VAT group has, amongst others, the following consequences:
## Import duties
Goods coming from outside the European Union and imported into Belgium are subject to import duties. Import duties are calculated based on three main elements:
### Classification
All products are classified based on the rules laid down in the Combined Nomenclature (CN). All products traded in the world can be classified in accordance with the tariff nomenclature and the six General Rules of Interpretation (GIR). An import duty rate is linked to every commodity code and is based on TARIC level.
### Origin
Based on international trade agreements (i.e. bilateral), a preferential import duty rate (i.e. a lower import duty rate) may apply to products imported in the European Union in case the goods meet the applicable criteria in the country benefiting from the agreement. In addition, it should be determined if your goods are produced in the beneficiary countries eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the EU's Scheme of General System of Preferences (GSP) for developing countries.
Furthermore, non-preferential rules of origin are used to determine the country of origin of goods for the application of the most-favoured nation treatment but also for the implementation of a number of commercial policy measures, such as trade embargoes, safeguard measures, anti-dumping and countervailing duties, or tariff quotas.
### Valuation
The customs value is determined based on one of the six rules laid down in the Union Customs Code (UCC). The most commonly used rule to determine the customs value upon importation in the European Union is the ‘transaction value’ (i.e. Article 70 of the UCC).
These valuation rules are harmonised on a global level through Article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) valuation agreement.
Various economic customs regimes (i.e. bonded warehouse, inward processing procedure, outward processing procedure) are available, allowing optimisation schemes throughout the supply chain.
## Excise duties
Excise goods are divided into the following two groups:
The European Union determined the threshold (with minimum and maximum rates) in which the EU member states have to define the applicable excise duty rate per product on a national basis. With respect to the national excise goods, every member state has the liberty to freely decide upon the national excise duty rates applicable.
## Property taxes
Immovable property is subject to an immovable WHT (also called ‘real estate tax’) due on a yearly basis to the region in which the property is located. This tax is calculated as a percentage of the so-called ‘cadastral income’ of the property (a kind of ‘deemed’ rental income). This deemed rental income should constitute the average normal net income of one year (based on rental incomes of similar properties in 1976). Since the cadastre has not been updated since 1976 and since this merely concerns a fictitious income, this 'deemed' rental income can only be considered as a presumed income, which generally will not match the actual income the immovable property could generate.
The tax rate depends on where the property is located (as it is a combination of regional, provincial, and communal tax).
Machinery and equipment can also be considered as immovable property if certain conditions are met (e.g. sustainable connection to the property although intrinsically being movable property).
## Registration duties
If the purchase or transfer of land is subject to VAT, no registration duties will be charged on the purchase or transfer.
In principle, only a fixed fee of EUR 50 is due upon a capital contribution.
Note that registration duties are also due when concluding (long-term) lease agreements on land/buildings located in Belgium. The applicable tax rate in this respect is 5% as of 1 January 2024.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due on transactions relating to public funds, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin, that are concluded or executed in Belgium (including when the order is given directly or indirectly to a foreign intermediary by a Belgian resident or a legal entity for the account of a seat or establishment thereof in Belgium), to the extent that a professional intermediary intervenes in these transactions. Exemptions for non-residents and others are available.
## Payroll taxes
In Belgium, there are no payroll taxes applicable other than those for social security contributions (*see below*) and income tax withholding.
## Social security contributions
### Contributions for employees and employers
The employers’ social security contributions in Belgium amount to 25%, to be calculated on uncapped income. This percentage consists of the base rate of the employers’ contribution (i.e. 19.88%) and the wage moderation (i.e. 5.12%).
For low wages, a reduction on the employer social security contributions applies, next to specific target group reductions. Moreover, for certain types of employers, a structural reduction, combined with a low wage component, may apply, next to specific target group reductions.
The employees’ social security contributions are fixed at 13.07% and are also to be calculated on uncapped income. Employees with a monthly gross salary of +/- EUR 3,200 or less are entitled to an automatic reduction of the personal contributions (i.e. 'employment bonus'). This reduction is applied as a flat rate that decreases gradually based on the employee's gross monthly salary. The calculation of the employment bonus differentiates between low and very low wage categories.
When calculating the social security contributions for blue collar workers (both employees’ as well as employers’ contributions), the calculation should always be done on the basis of 108% of the normal gross salary.
Social security contributions are deductible in determining taxable income both for the employer (CIT) and for the employee (PIT).
### Contributions for self-employed workers
The social security contributions due by individuals working as sole traders or on a self-employed basis are calculated (and collected) in an entirely different manner.
The contributions amount to (amounts for 2024):
No contributions are due on the income above EUR 107,300.30.
