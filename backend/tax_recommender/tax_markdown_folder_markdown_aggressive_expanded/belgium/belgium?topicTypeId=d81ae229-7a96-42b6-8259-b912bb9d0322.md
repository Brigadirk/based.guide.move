## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Domestic corporations and PEs of foreign corporations paying dividends, interest, royalties, service fees, and/or certain rentals are required to withhold tax.
Capital reductions decided by the general meeting as of 1 January 2018 will be deemed to derive proportionally from paid-up capital, taxed reserves (incorporated and non-incorporated into capital), and exempted reserves incorporated into the capital. The reduction of capital will be allocated to paid-up capital in the proportion of the paid-up capital in the total capital increased by certain reserves. The portion allocated to the reserves is deemed to be a dividend and will become subject to WHT (if applicable). Share premium distribution is submitted to the same system.
A uniform WHT rate of 30% is applicable on dividends, interest, and royalties. There are some exceptions.
Some WHT reductions/exemptions are foreseen under Belgian domestic tax law.
With respect to payments made to non-resident corporations or individuals, WHT exemptions and/or reductions can also be found in the DTTs concluded by Belgium.

Notes
1. The treaty concluded with ex-Yugoslavia is still applicable to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia.
2. Not applicable to Hong Kong.
3. The treaty concluded with the former USSR is still applicable to Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
4. It concerns an EU country or the treaty contains a qualifying exchange of information clause. Hence, the rate of 0% is applicable subject to the same conditions as invoked by the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (*see above*). Where multiple rates apply, the difference is generally based on the percentage of participation the recipient holds (directly) in the capital of the company paying the dividends.
5. Under the Bilateral II agreement concluded between Belgium and Switzerland, a rate of 0% is applicable under certain conditions.
6. With respect to EU countries, a WHT exemption is applicable, provided that the conditions laid down in the Interest & Royalty Directive are met (*see above*). Furthermore, note that some treaties contain an exemption for commercial debt claims or loans concluded with a bank or a governmental body.
7. This table does not take into account most favoured nation clauses.
The treaties that are currently in force are listed above. Based on the websites of the Belgian government, the following tax treaties/protocols are signed, modified, or under renegotiation (including some for the exchange of information clause): Botswana, Canada, Congo, France, India, Isle of Man, Macao, Malaysia, Moldova, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Tajikistan, Uganda, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.
