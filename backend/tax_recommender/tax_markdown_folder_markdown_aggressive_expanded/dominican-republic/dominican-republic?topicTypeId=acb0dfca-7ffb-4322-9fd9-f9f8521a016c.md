The last in first out (LIFO) method of inventory valuation is established for tax purposes. Other methods may be authorised upon request.

Dividend distributions in cash are subject to a 10% WHT as a sole and definite payment.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are not subject to taxation.
## Interest income
Interest income is considered as part of taxable income; in the case of non-resident, non-domiciled taxpayers, the tax should be paid through WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is considered as part of taxable income; in the case of non-resident, non-domiciled taxpayers, the tax should be paid through WHT.
## Foreign income

Tax determined on income from foreign source is subject to a credit mechanism. Taxes paid in the country where the income is originated can be credited up to the amount of the tax payable in the Dominican Republic on the same income.
