## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Tax on the Transfer of Industrialised Goods and Services (ITBIS) is a VAT applied to industrialised goods (movable) and services at a rate of 18%, with exemptions established by law to certain goods and services.
Exempt goods include a wide variety of goods, among which are basic products (eggs, milk, grains, live animals, frozen meats), seeds for planting, fruits and vegetables, medicine, insecticide and pesticides, books/magazines, educational material, wheelchairs, and prosthesis.
Exempt services include educational, health, financial (including insurance), pensions, ground transportation of people and cargo, electricity, water and waste pick-up, housing rental and personal care, and exported services.
A 0% rate applies to exports, including sales to FTZs.
## Tax on gross sales made by FTZs to local market
A 3.5% tax was created on the gross sales of goods and services made by companies in Dominican FTZs to individuals and legal entities in the local market.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are assessed at various rates depending on the nature of the goods and their country of origin. Free trade agreements exist (e.g. the Central America-Dominican Republic-US Free Trade Agreement [DR-CAFTA]) that decrease the customs duty rates for goods imported from the member countries.
## Selective consumption taxes (*Impuesto Selectivo al Consumo* or ISCs)
ISC is applied to the acquisition or import of certain goods and services.
There are ISCs that vary based on the product, which range from:
## Real Property Transfer Tax
The Real Property Transfer Tax is assessed at a basic rate of 3% on any transfer of ownership of real estate.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in the Dominican Republic.
## Payroll taxes
In addition to the social security contributions (*see below*), a 1% contribution from the payroll amount shall be made to the Governmental Training Institution (INFOTEP) on a monthly basis. This is paid solely by the employer (not subject to withholding). In addition, a 0.5% contribution shall be paid to INFOTEP, and the employer shall withhold said 0.5% contribution from employees’ bonus (not salary).
Employers must share 10% of their net profits with their employees. The Dominican Labor Code, however, allows employers to cap the amount distributed as follows: an employee with less than three years on the job will receive a maximum of 45 days’ salary; an employee with three years or more will receive a maximum of 60 days’ salary.
## Social security contributions
### Pensions
Employers contribute 7.10% of salaries and withhold 2.87% from employees’ salaries for pensions. The quotable salaries for contribution are 20 minimum wages.
### Family healthcare
Employers contribute 7.09% of salaries and withhold 3.04% from employees’ salaries for family healthcare. The quotable salaries for contribution are ten minimum wages.
### Labour risks insurance
Employers contribute 1.2% of salaries for labour risks insurance. The quotable salaries for contribution are four minimum wages.
