## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
We would like to highlight that, from 1 January 2024, the double tax treaty (DTT) concluded between the United States (US) and Hungary has been terminated. In this regard, US-sourced incomes of Hungarian tax resident individuals and the Hungarian-sourced incomes of US tax nationals might be subject to double taxation depending on the circumstances and nature of incomes.
