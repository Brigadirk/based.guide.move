## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
Please note that from 1 January 2025, certain personal tax allowances - the family allowance, the discount for first-time married couples, and the discount for people under 25 will only be available to Hungarian, EEA state, Ukrainian and Serbian citizens in the future. For example, Turkish or Chinese citizens living in Hungary will not be eligible for these discounts / allowances.
## Personal allowances
### PIT allowance for families
In 2025, the amounts of family tax allowance are as follows:
The allowance is deductible from the taxpayer's tax base. 15% of the unused amount of the child tax base allowance is to be deducted from the social security contributions (18.5%). As of 1 January 2020, all mothers who are currently raising at least four children, or who have raised four or more children during their lifetime, will be completely exempt from paying the PIT in case of certain types of income specified by law (especially in case of the wage income).
Persons entitled to the child benefit are entitled to apply this allowance regardless of whether they actually receive child benefit payments from the state budget.
The family allowance for families raising chronically ill or severely disabled children is higher. In addition to the existing family tax allowance, an extra allowance of HUF 66,670 per month can be applied for dependants who qualify as chronically ill or severely disabled person. This practically means an additional HUF 10,000 net allowance per dependant per month.
Please note that this allowance is currently expected to increase by 150% from 1 July 2025 and by 200% from 1 January 2026.
### PIT allowance for first-time married couples
Couples marrying after 31 December 2014 are able to decrease their tax bases by a total monthly amount of HUF 33,335, under certain circumstances. One requirement for this tax base allowance is that at least one member of the couple must marry for the first time. The allowance is available for a maximum period of 24 months. There is no age limit on eligibility for this allowance.
### PIT allowance for individuals under age 25
Individuals under age 25 can apply this allowance with respect to certain incomes, but only up to maximum the gross national average income published by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office for the July of the preceding year (HUF 636,700 for July 2024). It practically means that individuals under age 25 can apply the PIT-free allowance but only up to this maximum limit, which is net of HUF 95,505 / month in 2025.
### PIT allowance for mothers under age 30
Mothers under age 30, as of 1 January 2023, young women giving birth, older than age 25 but not older than age 30 when reaching the 91st day of pregnancy, giving birth, or adopting a child, may reduce their consolidated tax base with this allowance. The maximum amount of the tax relief is HUF 95,505 / month in 2025. However, it is important to know that the allowance is only eligible if the woman’s entitlement to the family tax allowance opened after 31 December 2022 in connection with her fetus, biological, or adopted child.
