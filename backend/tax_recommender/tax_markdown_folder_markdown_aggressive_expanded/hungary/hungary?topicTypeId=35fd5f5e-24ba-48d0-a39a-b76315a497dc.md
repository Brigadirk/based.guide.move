All other forms of income elements are taxable separately. Such income elements include income from dividend, interest, controlled capital market transactions, capital gains, sale of movable and immovable property etc.
The income realised from long-term savings accounts is subject to taxation when the account is terminated. The personal income tax rate is 15% if the savings account is terminated in the first three years after the conclusion of the contract and 10% in the next two years. No personal income tax needs to be paid on the realised profit after five years.
