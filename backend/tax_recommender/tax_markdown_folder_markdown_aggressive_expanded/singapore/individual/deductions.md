## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
## Employment expenses
Employment expenses can be deducted from employment income if they are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the income in Singapore. These expenses must have been incurred by the employee in carrying out one's official duties and cannot have been reimbursed by the employer or of a capital/private nature.
## Personal deductions
### Charitable contributions
Generally, a 250% deduction may be claimed for qualifying donations to Community Chest or any approved institution of a public character (status accorded to certain charities).
### Mortgage deduction
Interest expense may be deductible, provided it is incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of taxable income. Mortgage interest is, therefore, deductible only where the property concerned yields income.
### Subscription fees
An individual can deduct annual subscriptions paid to professional institutes or societies in which membership is generally required as a condition of employment. Subscriptions paid to professional bodies or societies for professional updates, knowledge, and networking are generally allowed as a deduction as well if relevant to the individual’s employment duties.
### Medical expenses
No deductions are allowed for medical expenses or for any other personal or household expenditure.
### Spouses
Spouses cannot transfer qualifying deductions (including excess capital allowances, trade losses, donations, and rental deficits) to each other.
Any unabsorbed trade losses or capital allowances can be carried forward to future years to be offset against the future income of the taxpayer until the amount is fully utilised, subject to existing rules. Any unutilised donations can also be carried forward to future years to be offset against the future income of the taxpayer, up to a maximum of five years.
## Personal reliefs
For year of assessment 2024 (income year 2023), the following amounts are deductible from the assessable income of a resident individual to arrive at the income subject to tax:
Additional reliefs are granted for dependant great-grandparents and handicapped siblings.
PIT reliefs are subject to a cap of SGD 80,000 per year of assessment.
## Business deductions
Where an individual carries on a trade, business, profession, or vocation, deductions are allowed for all outgoings and expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of the income being assessed (except expenses specifically prohibited under the Income Tax Act), including capital allowances (fiscal depreciation) on most fixed assets except for land and non-industrial buildings. Qualifying self-employed persons may claim a deemed amount of business expenses based on a prescribed percentage of the gross income earned (known as the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio) instead of the actual expenses incurred.
## Losses
Business losses and unutilised capital allowances may be offset against other sources of income such as employment, interest, dividend, and rental income in the same year. Any remaining unabsorbed losses and capital allowances can be carried forward, subject to certain conditions.
Current year unutilised business losses and capital allowances of up to SGD 100,000 can also be carried back to the year of assessment immediately preceding the year of assessment in which the loss and capital allowance arose.
