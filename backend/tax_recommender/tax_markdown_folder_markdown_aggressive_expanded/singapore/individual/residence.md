## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 06 May 2024
Individuals are resident in Singapore if they reside there, except for such temporary absences as may be reasonable and not inconsistent with a claim to be resident in Singapore. Individuals who are physically present or who exercise an employment (other than as a board director of a company) in Singapore for 183 days or more during the calendar year preceding the year of assessment are treated as tax residents for that year of assessment. As a concession, a foreigner who stays or works in Singapore for a consecutive period spanning three calendar years (not necessarily three complete calendar years) is considered a tax resident.
As a further concession, a foreigner who works in Singapore for a continuous period straddling two calendar years and stays in Singapore for at least 183 days will be considered a tax resident for those two years. This does not apply to directors of a company, public entertainers, and professionals.
Foreigners will also be treated as tax resident if they are issued with a work pass that is valid for at least a year, but their tax residency status will be reviewed based on the tax residency rule above at the point of tax clearance.
