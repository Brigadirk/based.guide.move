## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Tax on corporate income is imposed at a flat rate of 17%.
A partial tax exemption and a three-year start-up tax exemption for qualifying start-up companies are available.
Partial tax exemption (income taxable at normal rate):
| Chargeable income (SGD) | Exempt from tax | Exempt income (SGD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First 10,000 | 75% | 7,500 |
| Next 190,000 | 50% | 95,000 |
| Total |  | 102,500 |
Start-up tax exemption (income taxable at normal rate):
| Chargeable income (SGD) | Exempt from tax | Exempt income (SGD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First 100,000 | 75% | 75,000 |
| Next 100,000 | 50% | 50,000 |
| Total |  | 125,000 |
The start-up exemption is not available to property development and investment holding companies.
For income year 2023 (year of assessment 2024), eligible companies will receive a non-taxable CIT rebate cash grant of SGD 2,000. In addition, all companies will be granted a 50% CIT rebate, capped at SGD 40,000 if the company does not qualify for the CIT rebate cash grant or SGD 38,000 if it does.
Singapore adopts a one-tier taxation system, under which all dividends paid by Singapore-resident companies are tax-exempt in the shareholder’s hands.
