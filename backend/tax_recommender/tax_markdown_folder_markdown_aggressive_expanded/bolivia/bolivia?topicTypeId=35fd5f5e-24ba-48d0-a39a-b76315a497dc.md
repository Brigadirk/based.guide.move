## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Personal income tax rates
The personal income tax (*Regimen Complementario del Impuesto al Valor Agregado* or RC-IVA) rate is 13%.
Employers have the obligation to withhold and pay to the tax authorities the RC-IVA on gross income after deduction of social contributions and other concepts established by tax law.
In case of non-domiciled individuals who receive Bolivian-source labour income paid by non-resident entities (i.e. foreign employer), these non-domiciled individuals are considered direct taxpayers of RC-IVA and must declare and pay the tax on a monthly basis or upon leaving the country, whichever event occurs first.
## Local taxes on income
There are no local taxes on personal income in Bolivia.
