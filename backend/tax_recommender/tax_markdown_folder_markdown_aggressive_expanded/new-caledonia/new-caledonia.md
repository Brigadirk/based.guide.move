# New Caledonia
## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 April 2024
New Caledonia is a group of French islands and archipelagos located in the South Pacific Ocean. The capital city of New Caledonia is Nouméa, and the official language is French.
The local currency used in New Caledonia is the Pacific franc, also known as the CFP (*Communauté Française du Pacifique*) franc (XPF).
New Caledonia is governed by a specific constitutional regime (Articles 76 and 77 of the French Constitution) and benefits from a broad autonomy from France. However, independence from France has been rejected notably by a referendum held in December 2021.
The institutions of New Caledonia are Congress, the Government, the Customary Senate, the Economic, Social and Environmental Council, and the Customary Councils.
The State is represented by the High Commissioner of the Republic.
New Caledonia is divided into three provinces: the North Province, the South Province, and the Loyalty Islands Province. The provinces and the communes are territorial authorities. Each province has a deliberative assembly and has representatives in Congress. The law also recognises customary areas.
New Caledonia benefits from a tax autonomy from France, and the Congress is adopting its own tax laws that are gathered in a local tax code (i.e. the New Caledonia Tax Code, NCTC). The local tax administration is entitled to proceed with tax audits and has developed its own tax doctrine.
It is important to note that New Caledonia has entered into only one tax treaty, with France.
