## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
## Employment income
### Equity compensation
There are no special rules at present for equity compensation.
## Business income
Taxable business profits are determined on the basis of net profits for financial accounting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), subject to certain modifications in the TDA. In general, income is assessable when 'receivable', while expenses are deductible when 'payable'. A taxpayer with turnover of less than USD 100,000 may, however, elect to pay tax on a cash basis.
Gross income is defined widely to mean ’any realised increase in economic capacity in whatever name or form which can be used for consumption or to increase the wealth of the taxpayer other than wages that are subject to WIT’.
The gross income for a tax year is the total amount earned by the taxpayer, including, but not limited to, business income, property income, lottery prizes or awards, and refunds of tax payments previously deducted as an expense.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as business income.
## Dividend income
Dividend income is tax exempt (*see Exempt income below*).
## Interest income
