# Timor-Leste
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
The income of companies is generally subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at a flat rate of 10%.
## Industry-specific CIT rates
The rate of CIT for oil and gas contractors is 30%, while sub-contractors are subject to CIT at the flat rate of (generally) 6%.
Supplemental Petroleum Tax (SPT) also applies for oil and gas contractors and is imposed on 'accumulated net receipts' using a specific formula. SPT is deductible for CIT calculation purposes.
Separate tax arrangements apply for petroleum activities in the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) (*see the [Other issues](timor-leste/corporate/other-issues.html) section*).
## Local income taxes
There are no municipal or local taxes on income in Timor-Leste.
