## Sales tax
Sales tax is imposed on the sales tax value of:
Taxpayers liable for sales tax include the following:
The rates of sales tax are 2.5% for taxable goods imported into Timor-Leste and 0% for the sale of taxable goods and provision of taxable services in Timor-Leste.
## Services tax
Services tax is imposed at 5% on any gross consideration of more than 500 United States dollars (USD) received by a taxpayer for the provision of hotel, restaurant and bar, or telecommunication services.
## Import duties
Import duty applies to imported goods (except for specifically exempted goods) at 5% of the 'customs value' of the goods. Customs value is the fair market value, including cost, insurance, and freight (CIF), as stated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules.
The following goods are exempted from import duty:
## Excise tax
Excise tax is imposed on excisable goods where removed from a warehouse by a registered manufacturer for consumption in Timor-Leste or imported into Timor-Leste.
Below is the list of excisable goods (not exhaustive) and the respective rates of excise tax:
| Goods | Excise tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| Sugar and confectionery | USD 1.00/kg |
| Beer (with alcohol content less than 4.5%) | USD 2.70/litre |
| Beer (with alcohol content of 4.5% or more) | USD 4.50/litre |
| Wine, vermouth, fermented beverages (such as cider, perry) | USD 4.50/litre |
| Ethyl alcohol (other than denatured) and other alcoholic beverages | USD 8.90/litre |
| Gasoline, diesel fuel products, and other petroleum products | USD 0.06/litre |
| Tobacco and tobacco products | USD 100.00/kg |
| Cigarette lighters | 12% of the excise value |
| Smoking pipes | 12% of the excise value |
| Arms and ammunition | 200% of the excise value |
| Motor cars and small passenger vehicles (with an excise value exceeding USD 50,000) | 30% of the excise value |
| Private boats and aircraft | 20% of the excise value |
Note that the excise value of excisable goods imported into Timor-Leste is the total of the customs value and any import duty imposed. The excise value of excisable goods manufactured in Timor-Leste is their fair market value at the time of removal from the manufacturer's warehouse.
Goods on the above list are excisable goods, other than:
## Property taxes
There are no taxes on property in Timor-Leste.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Timor-Leste.
## Stamp duties
There is no stamp duty in Timor-Leste.
## Payroll taxes
An employer paying taxable wages shall withhold Wage Income Tax (WIT) at a rate of 10% from those wages and remit the WIT on a monthly basis.
An annual WIT return is due by the last day of the March following the end of the relevant tax year. Information on WIT withheld must also be provided to each employee on an annual basis or on termination of employment.
## Social security contributions
A Social Security scheme was introduced in November 2016, with both employers and employees required to make contributions. The scheme provides cover for loss of income/benefits due to work-related accidents, maternity, old age, and death. It would appear that Social Security contributions should be deductible to employers. Implementing regulations for this scheme should be closely monitored.
