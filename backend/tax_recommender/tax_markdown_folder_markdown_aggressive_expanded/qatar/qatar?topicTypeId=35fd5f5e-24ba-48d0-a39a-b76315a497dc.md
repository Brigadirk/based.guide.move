## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
Qatar operates a territorial taxation system, which means an individual is taxable in Qatar if one has generated qualifying Qatar-source income, regardless of one's tax residence.
Income tax is not imposed on employed individuals' salaries, wages, and allowances.
A self-employed individual may be subject to income tax if one derives qualifying income from sources in Qatar.
