## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
An entity that is wholly or partially foreign owned and that derives income from sources in Qatar is taxable in Qatar. In the case of a joint venture, the tax liability of the joint venture is dependent upon the foreign partners’ share of the joint venture's profit. Currently, no corporate income tax (CIT) is levied on a corporate entity that is wholly owned by Qatari nationals and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nationals that are resident in Qatar.
Unless specifically exempt from tax, an entity will be taxable in Qatar if it has generated Qatar-source income, regardless of the place of its incorporation.
Taxable income generally is subject to a flat (CIT) rate of 10%, with certain exceptions available.
The following tax rates apply in the specific circumstances noted:
## Local income taxes
There are no local, state, or provincial government taxes on income in Qatar.
