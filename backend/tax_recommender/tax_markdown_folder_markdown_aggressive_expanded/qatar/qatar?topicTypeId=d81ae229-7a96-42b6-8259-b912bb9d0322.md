## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
A unified 5% WHT applies to all services that are used, utilised, or benefited in the State of Qatar even if they are carried out in whole or part outside the State.
WHT also applies to, among others, interest, royalties, technical fees, commissions, brokerage fees, and other payments for services. The Regulations have excluded certain payments from the scope of WHT. Dividends are not subject to WHT.
New provisions have also been introduced whereby certain unpaid amounts are 'deemed' as having been paid for WHT purposes if they remain unpaid for a certain specified period.
WHT only applies if the payment is made to non-resident individuals or companies with respect to activities not connected to a PE in Qatar. Since residents and non-residents with a PE in Qatar should have a tax card, in practice, the WHT only applies if payments are made to service providers who do not hold a valid tax card.
The company or a branch that makes the payment to its foreign supplier is required to withhold the tax and remit to the GTA the funds that were withheld by the 16th day of the following month. In the event that the company does not make a payment to the GTA, the company will be liable for penalties.
All monthly WHT statements will have to be filed online in Dhareeba.
## Retention system
A retention system is in place whereby certain final contract amounts are required to be retained from payments made to a temporary branch in Qatar. Companies resident in Qatar and permanent branches are effectively not subject to the retention rules because they can secure a release of the final payment by presenting a tax card.
The retention is equivalent to the higher of 3% of the contract value (less the value of supply and work carried out abroad) or the final contractual payment until the temporary branch produces a no objection letter from the GTA.
In October 2022, the GTA issued a publication providing much needed guidelines on the procedure and requirements in order to obtain a no objection certificate (NOC) for the release of these retentions. As per the publication, taxpayers are required to provide certain information and documents as a part of their NOC request (including several accounting details, details of the relevant contract, and a contract completion certificate).
## Tax treaties
In case a relief from WHT is available under a double tax treaty (DTT), Qatar has a pay and reclaim mechanism (i.e. the payer is required to withhold and pay to the GTA). The payee will have to file a refund application to the GTA in order to avail the relief provided under the DTT.
The WHT rates under these treaties in respect of dividends, interest, and royalties are as follows:
| **Recipient** | **WHT (%)** | | | Effective **date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dividends \*** | **Interest** | **Royalties** |
