## Overview
Last reviewed - 03 April 2024
Qatar, located on the east coast of the Arabian Peninsula, is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and by the Persian Gulf to the north, east, and west. It is divided into seven municipalities, with Doha as the capital. The official language of Qatar is Arabic, and the currency is the Qatari riyal (QAR).
Ruled by the Al-Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar transformed itself from a British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues. Oil and natural gas revenues have placed Qatar as one of the highest *per capita* income countries, as well as one of the fastest growing economies. Qatar has the third largest natural gas reserves in the world, and these are expected to last well into the 22nd century. Its proven oil reserves should also enable continued output at current levels for many years. Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar's non-associated natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still account for approximately 50% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country.
In Qatar, there are four tax regimes in which foreign investors can operate, as follows:
