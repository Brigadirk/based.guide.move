## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
## Depreciation
Depreciation is taken on a straight-line basis at specified rates. However, within 90 days prior to submission of the tax declaration, the taxpayer may request that the tax department calculate the depreciation using a different method than the straight-line method. The tax department shall accept this request if it is based on a reasonable basis in accordance with the tax accounting principles and rules.
The principal depreciation rates are specified in the law, as follows:
| Type of fixed asset | Depreciation rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Buildings | 4 |
| Pre-fabricated buildings, furniture, and office equipment | 15 |
| Electronics and electrical equipment | 15 |
| Transportation and freight vehicles (trucks) | 15 |
| Tools and equipment | 20 |
| Cars and buses | 20 |
| Drilling equipment | 25 |
| Software | 25 |
| Computer equipment and accessories | 33.3 |
## Goodwill
In accordance with Executive Rule No. 30, amortisation of incorporated body goodwill is not allowed as a tax deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred prior to signing of the contract are not allowed as tax deductible costs.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible if they are related to operations in Kuwait and are paid to a local bank.
## Bad debt
Bad debt is deductible if it is related to operations in Kuwait and a final decision by the court is available.
## Charitable contributions
Grants, donations, and subsidies paid to licensed Kuwaiti public or private agencies are deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes and fees, except income tax, are deductible in Kuwait.
## Subcontract costs
A subcontractor is any third party, provider, or beneficiary that in any way executes a portion of the contract or any phase thereof.
As per Executive Rule No. 28, subcontract costs are deductible if the following conditions are met:
During inspection, the tax department shall disallow the amounts paid to subcontractors if the incorporated body does not notify the tax department of the subcontractors or does not withhold 5% of the contract value signed with the subcontractor as income tax retention.
## Net operating losses
As per the amended tax law, losses may be carried forward for a maximum of three years, provided that the following situations do not arise in the fiscal period following the period in which the loss was recorded:
Please note that losses cannot be carried back under the Kuwait tax law.
## Head office expenses/payments to foreign affiliates
The deduction of head office expenses (the overhead or the indirect expenses) is limited to 1.5% of the company's Kuwait revenue after deducting the subcontractors’ shares (if any).
The direct costs allocated by the head office (e.g. supply of goods, design and consultancy costs) are regulated as follows.
For costs of supply from outside Kuwait:
| Supply from | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue |
| --- | --- |
| Head office | 85% |
| Affiliated companies | 90% |
| Third parties | 95% |
For design costs incurred outside Kuwait:
| Work conducted by | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue |
| --- | --- |
| Head office | 75% |
| Affiliated companies | 80% |
| Third parties | 85% |
For consultancy costs incurred outside Kuwait:
| Work conducted by | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue |
| --- | --- |
| Head office | 70% |
| Affiliated companies | 75% |
| Third parties | 80% |
In case there is no separate revenue for consultancy, design, or supply work, although the nature of the contract requires the existence of such work, the following formula shall be applied:
Consultancy, design, or supply revenue = (consultancy, design, or supply costs / total direct costs) x contract revenue
