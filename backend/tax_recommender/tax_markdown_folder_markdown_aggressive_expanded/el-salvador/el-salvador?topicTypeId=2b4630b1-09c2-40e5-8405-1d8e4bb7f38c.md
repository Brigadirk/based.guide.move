## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## Social security contributions
In El Salvador, the social security system consists of the following benefits:
Social security contributions (ISSS) are mandatory for both employee and employer and are destined to public health services. The employee’s contributions are withheld from the employee’s monthly salary and are transferred by the employer to the Salvadorian Institute of Social Security through monthly payrolls. The contribution amounts are summarised in the table below:
| Monthly employee’s salary (USD) | Employee’s rate (%) | Employer’s rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 1,000 | 3 | 7.50 |
Note: For individuals who have salaries above USD 1,000, the social security contribution applicable is USD 30.00 for the employee and USD 75.00 for the employer.
Contributions to the AFP are mandatory for both employee and employer. The employee’s contributions are withheld from the employee’s monthly salary and are transferred by the employer. The employer’s contributions are paid to the AFP. Both contributions are reported to the Pension Fund Administrator through a monthly payroll. The percentages are summarised below:
| Monthly employee’s salary (USD) | Employee's rate (%) | Employer’s rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On the total monthly salary | 7.25 | 8.75 |
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT (i.e. *Impuesto al Valor Agregado* or IVA) is levied at a rate of 13% over the taxable amount. As a general rule, the taxable amount is the price or remuneration agreed upon by the parties. For imports, the taxable amount is the customs value.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in El Salvador.
## Local taxes
There is an annual tax of USD 3.43 in concept of transit (*Vialidad*) imposed by the municipality.
In addition, local municipalities may collect taxes from individuals if they are determined to perform any activity and/or service included in the corresponding municipal regulation.
