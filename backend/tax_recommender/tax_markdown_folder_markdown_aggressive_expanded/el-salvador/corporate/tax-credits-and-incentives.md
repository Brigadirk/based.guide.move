## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
El Salvador offers a wide range of incentives to attract foreign investment and drive new commercial and industrial developments. There are also no restrictions on foreign ownership or on mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures.
There are five specific laws in El Salvador that seek to encourage foreign investment by improving the country’s competitiveness in all areas involving the granting of tax incentives. These laws are the Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law, the Law of International Services, the Renewable Energy Incentives Law, the Tourism Law, and the Law for the promotion of Manufacturing and Technological Innovation.
### The Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law
The Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law No. 405, dated 3 September 1998, grants companies the following incentives:
Any foreign company may establish and function in a free zone or bonded warehouse and benefit from these incentives if they are engaged in production, assembly, manufacturing, processing, transformation, or commercialisation of goods and services and/or rendering of services linked to international or regional trade, such as gathering, packaging and repackaging, cargo consolidation, distribution of merchandise, and other activities connected or complementary to them.
### The Law of International Services
The Law of International Services No. 431, dated 11 October 2007, grants the same benefits as the Free Zone Law, but the beneficiaries are companies operating in Service Centres specially created according to this law and dedicated to international services as defined therein.
### The Renewable Energy Incentives Law
The Renewable Energy Incentives Law provides customs duties exemption on imports of machinery, equipment, and materials for up to ten years, income tax exemption for a period of five to ten years, and total tax exemption on revenues from the sale of Certified Emission Reductions, when certain requirements are met.
### The Law for the Promotion of Technological and Manufacturing Innovation
The Law for the Promotion of Technological and Manufacturing Innovation was recently approved and entered into force on 5 June 2023. This Law grants benefits of exemption from income tax and municipal taxes to income obtained from certain activities, which include:
The beneficiaries of this Law may opt for the following tax incentives for a period of 15 years:
