## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
Corporations not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico are subject to a 29% WHT at source on certain gross income items (considered fixed or determinable, annual or periodical [FDAP]) from Puerto Rico sources.
FDAP income may include interest received from a related person, rents, royalties, salaries, annuities, compensation, remuneration, and net capital gains. However, if the payment received is from dividends, a 10% WHT should apply.
The payer, as a withholding agent, is responsible for the withholding and remittance of the 29% (10% in the case of dividends) to the PRTD. Such tax is due on or before the 15th day of the month following the receipt of the income by the non-resident corporation. An annual informative return is also required to be filed no later than 15 April of the following year.
## Tax treaties
There are no tax treaties between foreign countries and Puerto Rico.
