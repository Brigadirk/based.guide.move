Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Foreign corporations and partnerships are classified as residents of Egypt if they meet one of the following conditions:
The executive regulations of the law indicate that Egypt is considered as the effective place of management if the entity meets any two of the following conditions:
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The PE concept is defined in the Income Tax Law as follows:
The new amendments as per Law No. 30 have expanded the ‘permanent establishment’ definition through the introduction of a threshold for the PE period and the concept of Service PE and Insurance PE, as well as certain Agency PE updates in alignment with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 7.
A foreign company that is deemed to have a PE risk, according to the Egyptian Companies Law, should incorporate a legal vehicle in Egypt.
There are several legal forms existing under the Egyptian Companies Law from which a foreign company can choose to incorporate, and these are a joint-stock company, limited liability company, branch, or representative office.
