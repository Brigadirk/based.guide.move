## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Resident companies are taxed on worldwide income. Non-resident corporations and partnerships pay tax on income derived from their permanent establishments (PEs) in Egypt.
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate in Egypt is 22.5% on the net taxable profits of a company.
The above rate applies to all types of business activities except for oil exploration companies, whose profits are taxed at 40.55%. In addition, the profits of the Suez Canal Authority, the Egyptian Petroleum Authority, and the Central Bank of Egypt are taxable at a rate of 40%.
## Local income taxes
There are no governorate or local taxes on corporate income in Egypt.
