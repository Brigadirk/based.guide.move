# Paraguay
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign tax credits are not applied to local tax payments in Paraguay.
## Investment incentives
The framework of economic investment was established in the Law No. 60/90, which offers some special tax exemption benefits to foreign and local investors.
The benefits of the Law No. 60/90 may be available for the following investments:
The investment incentives included in Law No. 60/90 that remain enacted after tax law modification (Law No. 2421/04) are the exemptions from certain fiscal, municipal, and customs duties taxes.
When the amount of financing for an investment is equal to or greater than USD 5 million, it will be exempt from WHTs on interest, commissions, and capital that have to be paid to financial or banking entities abroad. This benefit is for five years.
If the investment is at least USD 5 million and the project is approved by the tax authorities, the dividends and profits derived from the project are tax exempt. The mentioned exemption is granted for five years and may be extended to ten years.
## *Maquila* tax exemptions (Law No. 1064/97)
Innovative regulations allow for virtual commerce between *maquila* factories, which improve the utilisation of goods imported under the temporary regime (called ‘virtual *maquila*’).
Paraguayan legislation does not impose restrictions in terms of the types of products and services that the *maquila* industry may comprise. The *maquila* activity’s national policy is regulated and supervised by the National Council of the *Maquila* Industry for Export (CNIME). Both individuals and legal entities domiciled in Paraguay, whether national or foreign, may take advantage of these regulatory benefits.
## Free trade zones (called '*zona franca*' Law No. 523/95)
Free trade zones, where all types of commercial, industrial, and service activities may be carried out, constitute a relevant incentive for business.
The legal framework governing such zones offer several advantages in terms of tax exemptions, as well as a special tax regime with an income tax rate of 0.5%.
The main purpose of free trade zones is the development of activities in connection with foreign markets; however, operations within the country are also allowed.
Law No. 523/95, ‘which authorises and establishes the Free Trade Zone Regime’, and its regulatory Decree No. 15,554/96, ‘which regulates the Free Trade Zone Law’, among others, establish the guidelines related to activities within free trade zones.
The aforementioned regulation establishes two main entities, the ‘concessionaire’, responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure for freight operational management, and the user, responsible for carrying out the commercial, industrial, or service activity. The regulation therefore establishes the administrative measures that enable operations in free trade zones and its supervision, control, and development.
There are currently two free trade zones located in the Alto Paraná region (northeastern region, in close proximity to the border with Brazil and Argentina), in which national and international companies actively operate.
