## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
In general, branches and resident companies are taxed alike (i.e. taxation of corporate profits is postponed until profit distribution). As with companies, a PE's taxable base is a sum of taxable items consisting of profit distributions and deemed distributions. However, the PE's taxable base consists not only of taxable items incurred directly through the PE but also of any taxable items the non-resident allocates to the PE. Since technically branches and PEs cannot pay dividends, this fact makes it more difficult to determine what forms the taxable base for a PE or branch.
The PE's taxable base includes items in cash or otherwise that are extracted from the PE, including profit distributions and deemed distributions. These items include the following:
The following expenses would be excluded from the PE's taxable base:
Accordingly, the PE's taxable profit is significantly affected by keeping separate books and holding documentary evidence for the type of expenditure concerned (cost of goods sold, expenses related to the PE's business activity, or non-business expenses).
