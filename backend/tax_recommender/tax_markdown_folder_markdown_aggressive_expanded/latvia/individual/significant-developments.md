## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
From January 1, 2025, a package of changes to the application of personal income tax (PIT) has been implemented in Latvia. The main changes include revised PIT rates, a single fixed personal allowance replacing the income-differentiated personal allowance, and an additional 3% PIT rate on the portion of total annual income exceeding EUR 200,000, among other relevant adjustments.
The special royalties regime has been extended until the end of 2027. Under this regime, individuals who are not registered as self-employed and receive payments classified as royalties will continue having 25% withheld from their gross royalties by the payer.
- A 25.5% PIT on income of up to EUR 105,300 per year.
- A 33% PIT on income above EUR 105,300 per year.
