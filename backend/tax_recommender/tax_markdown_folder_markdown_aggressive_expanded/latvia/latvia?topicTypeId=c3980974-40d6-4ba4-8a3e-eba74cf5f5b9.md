## Taxable period
## Tax returns
Items subject to CIT should be reported either monthly or annually, depending on the nature of the items. In general, items subject to CIT should be included in the tax return for the tax period in which costs were incurred. If a tax base arises, a tax return should be filed each month on or before the 20th day of the following tax period. If a tax return is not filed with the SRS, this will mean that no tax liability arose in that month. The tax base can be adjusted for non-business expenses only in the month they were incurred. Accordingly, if an adjustment is still needed, a late fee will be charged.
It is mandatory for taxpayers to file a tax return for the last month of the financial year.
The transition rules govern cases where a taxpayer’s financial year is different from a calendar year. In that case, the taxpayer should prepare interim financial statements and the CIT return.
## Payment of tax
If a tax base arises, the tax charge should be paid each month on or before the 23rd day of the following tax period.
## Tax audit process

It can be extended to 60 days if information is requested from a foreign tax authority. If a simultaneous tax audit with a foreign tax authority is initiated, then such extension is not limited.
The SRS should inform the taxpayer of a tax audit no later than ten working days before the start of the audit with notification about documents the SRS would like to see.
During a tax audit, the auditors will notify the taxpayer about any irregularities in the calculation of tax payments and any fines that could be levied. Before issuing the tax audit decision, the auditors will invite the taxpayer to final negotiations to discuss the tax audit results.
Following the tax audit and notification of its findings, the company may take the following steps:
## Statute of limitations
The SRS may collect any unpaid taxes within three years after tax payment was due. Transfer prices may be examined for five years. If taxable income adjustments arise from transfer pricing risks and hybrid mismatches, the tax audit and the tax control may cover five years after the statutory due date for payment.
The SRS tends to scrutinise:
