## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) and cooperation
Greece and the United States have reached an agreement in substance and Greece has consented to disclose this status on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) arrangements with effect from 30 November 2014. The IGA was ratified by L. 4493/2017, which was published in the Government Gazette in October 2017.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime
By virtue of L. 4378/2017 and L. 4474/2017, Greece proceeded on 30 September 2017 to the exchange of information on accounts held by financial institutions. The exchange of information will take place in September of each respective year, and the deadline for the submission of the information to the tax authorities by the financial institutions is set in June of each year.
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Greece adheres, in general, to the BEPS guidelines.
On 7 June 2017, Greece signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('Multilateral Instrument' or 'MLI'). On 26 January 2021, the Greek Government Officially published Law 4768/2021 to ratify the MLI. On 30 March 2021 Greece deposited its instrument of ratification for the MLI with the OECD.
In 2019, Greece transposed the Directive laying down rules against tax avoidance practices (ATAD) and more precisely the CFC rules, the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR), and the interest deduction limitation rules, which are in the spirit of BEPS guidelines.
Furthermore, on 31 July 2020, Greece completed the transposition of the exit taxation and the hybrid mismatch rules laid down in the Directive (EU) 2016/1164, as amended by Directive (EU) 2017/952. Said provisions apply as of 1 January 2020.
## EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6)
On 31 July 2020, the law implementing the Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 into the local legislation was published in the Government Gazette. The law overall follows the scope of the Directive, and no major deviations are identified.
The rules of DAC6 introduce mandatory disclosure requirements for certain cross-border tax arrangements, provided the main benefit of such arrangements is the expectation of a lower tax burden and/or of other specific characteristics (hallmarks) defined in the Directive. The reporting obligation lies primarily with the intermediary business consultants of taxpayers and, in certain instances, with the taxpayers themselves.
The DAC6 provisions have a retroactive effect, and the reporting obligation captures transactions implemented from 25 June 2018 onwards.
The first reporting of information on reportable cross-border arrangements, which was implemented between 25 June 2018 and 31 January 2021, took place on 28 February 2021. The first automatic exchange of information between the tax authorities of the member states took place on 30 April 2021.
For transactions that have been designed or implemented as of 1 February 2021, there is a period of 30 days for filing relevant information by intermediaries and relevant taxpayers in accordance with the provisions of DAC6 legislation.
No or late filing triggers penalties for the intermediaries or the taxpayers.
## Choice of business entity
The main differences between a subsidiary (i.e. *Société Anonyme* [SA] or limited liability company [LLC]) and a branch of a company, from a corporate establishment perspective, are the following:
The main legal differences between an SA and an LLC in Greece from a company law/establishment perspective are the following:
