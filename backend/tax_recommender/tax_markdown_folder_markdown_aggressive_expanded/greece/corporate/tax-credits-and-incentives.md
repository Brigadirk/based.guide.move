## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Tax paid abroad for income taxable in Greece is credited but is limited to the amount of Greek tax due.
## Deferred taxation
The concept of deferred taxation applies on the basis of the IFRS to entities supervised by the Bank of Greece (namely banks and leasing companies, as well as factoring companies). In this respect, said entities may convert tax assets into tax credits in return for shares issued to the Greek state. Specific rules and conditions apply.
## Incentives for job enhancement
Under certain conditions, an increase of tax deductibility by 50% and up to 14 times the minimum wage of an unmarried employee over 25 years old per employment of the employers’ contributions is provided.
The criteria for the characterisation of the above expenses are determined by a joint decision of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Development and Investments, which is issued after a suggestion of the Governor of the IAPR. In the event that losses occur after deduction of the above percentage, they shall be carried forward for up to five years, in accordance with Article 27 of the Greek ITC.
## Patent incentives
Moreover, the amount of the above-mentioned exemption is calculated as follows:
Eligible R&D expenses / Total R&D expenses x Profits from the exploitation of the patent = Exemption amount
The numerator may be increased up to 30%, on condition that it does not exceed the total amount of R&D expenses.
Additionally, the amount of the exemption, which is calculated as above, is depicted in a special reserve account and is subject to taxation in accordance with the general provisions of the Greek ITC when distributed or capitalised (i.e. upon use).
This exemption is granted provided that there is R&D expense that was carried out by the patent development company.
According to the new law 5162/2024, which will take effect from fiscal year 2025, the following modifications have been made:
1. **Extended Exemption Period**: Businesses that have developed and hold internationally recognized patents are entitled to an income tax      exemption for profits from these patents for up to three consecutive tax years. Additionally, for the following seven years, there is a 10%        exemption from the income tax payable on the company's profits from the exploitation of the patent.
2. **Calculation of Exemption:** The method for calculating the exemption remains the same, but the new law emphasizes the connection            between the patent and the R&D expenses incurred by the company for its development.
These changes aim to further incentivize innovation and the development of patents by providing extended tax benefits.
## Other tax incentives
### Strategic Investment Law
Investment plans are classified based on investment size, FTEs, and industry sectors in four categories: Strategic Investments 1, Strategic Investments 2, Emblematic Investments, and Fast-track licensed Strategic Investments. Types of aid vary depending on the kind of investment but typically include (i) spatial planning, (ii) income tax rate stabilisation, (iii) fast track licensing, (iv) tax exemption, (v) cash grants for capex/opex (only for emblematic investments, and (vi) cash grants for R&D or recruiting disabled. It should be noted that tax exemption can be used for a period of 15 years.
Important notes:
### Development Law - Greece Strong Development
On 4 February 2022, Law 4887/2022, 'Development Law - Greece Strong Development’, has been voted by the Greek Parliament. The new Development Law provides a general framework, specified for each aid scheme foreseen through ministerial decisions issued. In essence, the provisions of the new Law start to apply following the issuance of the relevant ministerial decisions. Up to date, the Ministry of Development and Investments has solely proceeded with the issuance of ministerial decision for the following aid schemes: 'Manufacturing - Supply chain', 'Enhancement of Tourism Investments', 'Agri food - primary production and processing of agricultural products - fisheries and aquaculture', and ‘Entrepreneurship 360°’.
Under the Law, an explicit reference to the provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) of the European Commission (651/17.07.2014, Law 187/1/26.06.2014) is made.
A threshold is being provided for the types of aid available to individuals’ investment projects, as well as to companies and groups of companies, in order to achieve dispersion of the beneficiaries of state aid.
Special categories of aid are being determined, either (i) on the basis of the performance of the companies (extroversion, mergers, employment increase, sectors, high added value), or (ii) on territorial basis (highland, border areas and areas with increased migration burden, industrial areas, innovations zones). Companies that fall under special categories may be reinforced through capital aids, in case the latter are not provided, or by additional capital aids, in case the latter are provided.
### General Section
The General Section of the new Law regulates the beneficiaries of aids provided, the terms and prerequisites for participation, the covered investment projects, the eligible expenses, the types of aids, the procedure regarding the filing of applications and evaluation of investments projects, as well as the issues regarding the implementation and completion of investments projects.
Beneficiaries of the aid schemes are commercial companies, cooperatives, social cooperative companies of Law 4019/2011, groups of producers, organisations of producers, agricultural partnerships of Law 4384/2016, urban cooperatives, companies under formation or under merger (on the condition that they have been incorporated or merged before the commencement of the project), public and municipal enterprises and their subsidiaries (under specific conditions), joint ventures provided that they have been registered with General Commercial Registry (GEMI), and individual companies with a maximum eligible investment project cost of EUR 200,000 and solely for the aid scheme 'agri food - primary production and processing of agricultural products - fisheries and aquaculture'.
The minimum investment amount ranges from EUR 50,000 (for social cooperative companies, agricultural partnerships, groups of producers, organisations of producers, urban cooperatives, and agricultural partnerships) to EUR 1 million (for large companies). Moreover, for medium-sized companies, the investment amount is set at EUR 500,000, for small companies at EUR 250,000, and for very small companies at EUR 100,000.
The investment projects that fall under the aid schemes should have the character of initial investment (buildings, machinery, intangible) and meet certain conditions (indicatively, creation of new plants, extension of existing plants’ capacity, etc.).
The investment projects that are covered by the Law relate, in principle, to all economic sectors, subject to certain exceptions (sector of steel, coal, synthetic fibres, shipbuilding, etc.). Under certain conditions, the covered investment projects could also relate to:
In respect of the eligible expenses, these are divided into: (i) eligible expenses of regional state aid nature based on the Regional State Aid Map (capital expenditure in tangible and intangible assets, employment cost of new employees) and (ii) eligible expenses of non-regional state aid, which aim to broaden and enrich the investment options towards new qualitative directions. The maximum amounts and percentages of regional state aids and non-regional state aids are also being determined. Based on the general framework, the maximum amounts and percentages of each individual aid scheme are being specified, in accordance with the provisions of the Special Section of the new Law.
Further, with regard to the types of aid, the following types are provided:
All types of aids can be provided either separately or in combination thereof and are all taken into account for the determination of the total aid amount of each investment project. The types of aid are granted (and, respectively, the benefit starts to apply), following a relevant certification, either in lump sum (following the issuance of the decision certifying the completion and the commencement of the productive operation of the project) or gradually (according to the specific requirements per each type of aid granted).
The evaluation process includes the stage of completion and legality control and the evaluation stage and is carried out either through the method of comparative evaluation or through the method of direct evaluation. Investment projects that fall under the aid schemes are audited at any time and at any stage of implementation of the investment project or at any stage of fulfilling their long-term liabilities.
