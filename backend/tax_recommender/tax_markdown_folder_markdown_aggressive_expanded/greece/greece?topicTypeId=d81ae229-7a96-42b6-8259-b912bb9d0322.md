## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 05 September 2024
WHT rates are as follows:
| Type of income | WHT rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends | 5 |
| Interest | 15 |
| Royalties and other payments | 20 |
| Fees for technical projects, management fees, and consultancy and other related services | 20 |
| By exception, fees received by contractors of every kind of technical projects and lessors of public, municipal, association, or port proceeds | 3% on the value of the project under construction or lease payment |
Legal entities tax resident in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalties, fees received for the provision of consultancy and other related services, and management fees, unless provided to general government bodies.
Legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to Greek WHT in relation to technical services, consultancy services, or other related services and management fees.
By virtue of the provisions of the Ministerial Circular 1007/2017, it is clarified that the fees for technical services, management fees, fees for consulting services, and the remuneration for similar services received by an EU legal entity through its PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.
The above exemption does not include the fees received by EU legal entities from the services provided to the general government bodies, as well as the fees for technical services received by the EU legal entities.
Conversely, non-EU foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are subject to Greek WHT in relation to the provision of the aforementioned services.
Legal entities that are tax resident in Greece or foreign legal entities that maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT in relation to royalty payments.
The exemption from the obligation of WHT for payments of dividends, interest, and royalties by a Greek subsidiary to its parent company includes payments of dividends, interest, and royalties to Greek parent companies.
For the exemption from dividend WHT, the following conditions apply:
A general anti-abuse rule is applicable by virtue of which the tax exemption in case of collection and payment of dividends is lifted in case it is considered that a ‘non-genuine arrangement’ exists. A ‘non-genuine arrangement’ is an arrangement that has not been put into place for valid commercial reasons reflecting the economic reality.
For the exemption from WHT for interest and royalty payments, the following conditions apply:
Payments of interest of bank loans (excluding bond loans), including default interest, as well as interest of intra-bank deposits, are exempt from WHT.
Interest received from Greek government bonds and treasury bills, as well as from listed corporate bonds, by legal entities that are not tax resident in Greece and that do not maintain a PE in Greece are not subject to WHT.
The following table provides a summary of the WHTs applicable under the respective DTTs entered into by Greece:
