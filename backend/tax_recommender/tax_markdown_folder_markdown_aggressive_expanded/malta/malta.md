# Malta
## Overview
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Malta, an archipelago located in the Mediterranean, became a British Crown Colony in the early 19th century and remained so until 21 September 1964, when it became an independent sovereign state. In 1974, Malta was declared a Republic. Malta is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. Soon after independence, Malta was admitted to the Council of Europe.
The mid-1980s saw the transformation of Malta into a flourishing economic hub. Malta began to be seen by the international community as an attractive freight trans-shipment point, financial centre, and tourist destination. The manufacturing industry also continued to expand. It was around this time when Malta began demonstrating interest in becoming a member of the European Community. Malta eventually joined the European Union (EU) in May 2004, and its adoption of the euro (EUR) took place a few years later, on 1 January 2008. The capital city of Malta is Valletta, and the official languages are Maltese and English.
The Maltese financial services industry is one of the faster growing sectors, taking advantage of a number of key attributes that Malta offers, including a highly-skilled workforce, excellent service, competence, technical infrastructure, and robust legislative and regulatory frameworks, including tax efficiency.
