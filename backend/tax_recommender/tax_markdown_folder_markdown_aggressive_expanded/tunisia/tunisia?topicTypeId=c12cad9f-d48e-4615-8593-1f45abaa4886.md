## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Tunisian-resident companies are subject to CIT in Tunisia on the basis of profits generated from permanent establishments (PEs) located in Tunisia and those attributable to Tunisia by virtue of a double tax treaty (DTT). Non-Tunisian-resident companies are subject to CIT on the basis of their Tunisian-sourced income.
PEs of non-Tunisian-resident companies are subject to CIT in the same way and under the same conditions as Tunisian-resident companies. However, certain particularities, related mainly to deductions, exist (*see the [Branch income](tunisia/corporate/branch-income.html) section*).
CIT is also due by non-resident, non-PE companies on Tunisian-sourced income through withholding taxes (WHTs).
CIT is broadly levied on the total net income resulting from the statutory financial statements of the company, duly adjusted according to the specific tax rules.
Positive/negative items of income are taxed/deducted based on the accrual basis. Income items accruing in a tax period where the above principle is not met are not allowed for tax deduction nor taxed in that tax period. Tax deduction/taxation is correspondingly deferred to the future tax periods where the principle will be met.
Income items have to be certain in their occurrence and objectively determined or determinable in their amount.
## CIT rates
CIT rates applicable are as follows (subject to exemptions and tax incentives):
Indeed, CIT is due at the rate of:
## Minimum corporate tax
A minimum corporate tax is due at the rate of 0.2% of the local turnover, including value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of TND 500, in case:
However, the minimum corporate tax is reduced to 0.1% of the gross turnover for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 10% and companies selling products with regulated prices having a gross margin not exceeding 6%, with a ceiling of TND 300.
The minimum corporate tax is not due by companies benefiting from the whole exemption of profits deriving from operations (e.g. companies established in the regional development zones, companies operating in the agricultural sector) during the period of tax holidays. These latter are fixed by decree.
