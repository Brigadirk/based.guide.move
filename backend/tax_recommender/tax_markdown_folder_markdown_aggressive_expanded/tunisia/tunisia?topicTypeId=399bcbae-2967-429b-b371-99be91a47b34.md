## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### VAT scope and rates
VAT is levied under the Tunisian VAT Code and is due on all transactions taking place in Tunisia.
The sale of goods is considered as taking place in Tunisia, and subject to VAT, if the goods sold are delivered in Tunisia. The sale of services is considered as taking place in Tunisia, and subject to VAT, if the services sold are exploited or used in Tunisia.
The standard rate of VAT is 19%. Lower rates of 13% and 7% apply to specifically designated operations. Note that these rates are effective as of 1 January 2018 (previously 18%, 12%, and 6%, respectively).
Note that the Finance Law for 2023 increased the VAT rate applicable to fees charged by lawyers, bookkeepers, chartered accounts, tax advisors, consultants and experts, architects, consulting engineers, etc. from 13% to 19% as of 1 January 2023.
Some operations, products, or services are out of the scope of VAT in Tunisia, and some others are expressly exempt from VAT.
Some goods and services may be acquired VAT free, based on a certificate delivered for the purpose by the relevant tax authorities. This exemption is granted mainly to wholly exporting companies (other than international trade companies and service companies, which no longer benefit from the VAT free acquisition of goods as per the Finance Law for 2022), oil and gas companies, their contractors, and their subcontractors.
Registration for VAT purposes may be either obligatory or optional.
Voluntary registration is allowed where persons:
### Output VAT
Output VAT is calculated on the basis of the amount of the taxable transaction excluding VAT.
### Input VAT
Individuals and companies that are subject to VAT may deduct the input VAT incurred on the purchase of goods and services necessary to carry out activities subject to VAT.
### VAT declaration
VAT is declared and paid on a monthly basis.
### Refunds
If the input VAT exceeds the output VAT, the VAT credit resulting from the difference between the input VAT and the output VAT may be reimbursed on the basis of a written request made to the tax authorities.
The VAT credit is refundable if it arises from:
To benefit from the refund of VAT credits, the taxpayer must already have submitted all tax returns and paid all taxes due at the time of submission of the request for the refund.
The VAT credit (other than the one derived from exports, VAT-free sales, and WHT of VAT and from some investments as provided for by article 15 of the VAT Code) subject to six successive monthly tax returns showing a credit, is reimbursable through an advance payment of 15% on request without preceding tax audit. This rate is increased to 50% for companies which financial statements are subject to statutory audit, subject to the certification with no modification affecting the tax basis of the last financial statements due at the date of the refund request. The remaining balance will be reimbursed subject to a tax audit.
For companies that rely from the Big Companies Direction (*Direction des Grandes Entreprises*), the said advance will be increased to 100%, subject to a special report issued by the statutory auditor and relating to the CIT credit to be requested for refund.
The VAT credit derived from exports, VAT-free sales, WHT of VAT, and from investments as provided for by article 3 of the investment law is reimbursable through an advance payment of 100% on request without preceding tax audit.
The refund would be considered as final subject to a tax audit.
### Time limits
The taxpayer may claim the VAT credit within three years starting from the date from which the VAT credit becomes refundable.
## Customs duties/Import tariffs
### Import VAT
Importation of goods and services are subject to import VAT unless:
### Customs duties
Customs duties are due on importations other than those made from the European Union (EU).
Some equipment expressly designated by the Tunisian domestic law is exempt from customs duties, whether imported from EU countries or not.
Customs duties are not due in cases where the importer is expressly exempt, even if the goods are imported from outside the European Union.
For temporary importation of equipment, the customs duties due are to be calculated in proportion to the period spent in Tunisia. 1/60 of the total customs duties are due per month spent in Tunisia.
As per article 39 of the Finance Law for 2018, subject to fixed customs rates, common customs duties for products and equipment with NGP codes included in chapters 25 to 97 are increased as of 1 January 2018 from 20% to 30% and from 0% to 15% for listed products (listed in appendix 2 to the Finance Law for 2018).
In addition, the Finance Law for 2018, as modified by the Finance Law for 2020, provided for an increase in the customs duties rates applicable to a list of products originated from Turkey for a period of four years as of 1 January 2018. These provisions will be eliminated progressively over a period of three years using equal average annual rates, after the expiry of a period of four years.
The Finance Law for 2024 provided for an increase in the customs duties rates applicable to a list of products originated from Turkey for a period of three years as of 1 January 2024. These provisions will be eliminated progressively over a period of two years using equal average annual rates, after the expiry of a period of three years.
Also, the Finance Law for 2022 has increased customs from 0%, 15%, or 30% to 43% for some products and from 0%, 15%, 30%, or 36% to 50% for others, as follows:
In addition, the Finance Law for 2022 has decreased customs duties on solar panels from 20% to 10% and provided a decrease of customs duties on some vehicles with a hybrid thermal and electric engine.
The Finance Law for 2024 has increased the customs duties applicable to the import of solar panels from 10% to 30%.
## Excise taxes
There are no provisions for excise taxes in Tunisia.
## Property taxes
A real estate tax (RET) is calculated by the relevant municipalities and is notified annually to the taxpayers at the beginning of the civil year.
For companies subject to the payment of the local authority tax (LAT) (*see below*) and in case the LAT paid over the year is less than the RET notified by the municipalities, then the differential is due and is payable as complementary LAT. In other words, the RET constitutes a minimum of due LAT per year.
## Transfer taxes
The registration of some operations is compulsory. In these cases, the registration fees are expressly determined by the Registration and Stamp Fees Code.
Registration remains optional for certain operations. In case of optional registration, the registration fees due to be paid are equal to TND 30 (as per the Finance Law for 2022) per page and per copy.
In case of compulsory registration, the fees due depend on the nature of the transaction and the goods involved.
Some transactions are subject to proportional registration fees, for example:
Transactions that are not subject to proportional registration fees, as well as transactions for which registration is optional, are subject to insignificant fixed registration fees (TND 30 per page).
Contracts and agreements (including concessions agreements, marketing, franchise, etc.) should be registered at the rate of 0.5% (based on the gross amount including taxes). In case of agreements with an indefinite duration or for a duration exceeding three years, registration fee is due based on the gross amount related to the first three years.
The Finance Law for 2022 provides that acquisitions of immovable properties made by the government/state are exempt from registration fees. This provision applies to contracts submitted for registration from 1 January 2022, notwithstanding their dates.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due, in general, on certain contracts expressly designated, as well as invoices, unless the customer is expressly exempt.
In general, stamp duties are TND 1 for invoices (the Finance Law for 2023 provides an increase of stamp duties on invoices from TND 0.6 TND to TND 1 per invoice as of 1 January 2023), subject to exemptions provided for by the law, including invoices related to export operations.
Certain documents are expressly exempt from stamp duties, mainly judgments, checks, etc.
Note that the Finance Law for 2022 provides that a stamp duty of 100 millimes per receipt issued to customers is due by:
## Social solidarity contribution (SSC)
SSC is due by legal entities at the rate of 1% of the CITable income.
For companies subject to CIT at the rate of 15%, 20%, or 10%, the SSC to be paid over the years FY22 to FY24 (to be declared over FY23 to FY25) will be due at the rate of 3% of the CITable income, with a minimum of TND 400 for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 15% or 20% and of TND 200 for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 10%.
