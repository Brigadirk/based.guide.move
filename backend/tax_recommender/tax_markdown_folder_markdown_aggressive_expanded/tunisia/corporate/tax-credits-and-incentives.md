## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Two laws have been promulgated in order to promote investment in Tunisia, the Investment Law and the Tax Incentives Law.
## Investment Law n° 2016-71 of 30 September 2016
### Objectives of the Investment Law
The purpose of the Investment Law is to promote investment and to encourage the creation of enterprises, notably through:
### Main features of the Investment Law
The Investment Law defines the legal regime for investment promoted by persons, resident or non-resident, in all sectors of economic activities, fixed by decree.
Under the Investment Law, investors benefit from the following incentives:
Conditions and modalities to benefit from subsidies are defined by decree.
Also, as per the Investment Law, foreign investors have the same rights and obligations provided for by the Investment Law as Tunisian investors in comparable situations.
The Investment Law provided for the need to comply with response deadlines for each authorisation requested by the investor and the obligation to justify each refusal in writing. Failure to reply within the time limit constitutes acceptance under article 4 of the Law (except for activities excepted to be defined by decree).
Investors’ properties and intellectual property (IP) rights are protected in accordance with the legislation in force. Investor's property may not be expropriated except for public interest reasons, without discrimination between Tunisian and foreign investors, subject to fair and equitable compensation.
## Tax Incentives Law n° 2017-8 of 14 February 2017
The major tax incentives provided for by the Tax Incentives Law are mainly relating to:
## Wholly exporting activities
The following are considered as wholly exporting companies:
Note that wholly exporting companies may commercialise locally, during a given year, up to 30% of the turnover of the previous year without losing the status of a wholly exporting company. It is noteworthy that the turnover derived from the sales of waste to companies authorised by the Ministry of the Environment for the exercise of recovery, recycling, and treatment activities, as well as the services or sales realised within international public tenders, are not included in the rate of 30%.
### Tax incentives at the exploitation phase
Wholly exporting companies benefit from:
Also, foreign employees recruited by totally exporting companies may benefit from the payment of PIT at the reduced rate of 20% of gross revenues.
## Regional development zones activities
The Tax Incentives Law provides that investments in certain activities (except for some sectors listed by decree) carried out by entities established in regional development zones (fixed by decree) benefit from a number of tax incentives, detailed as follows:
### Tax incentives at the exploitation phase
#### CIT
Profits derived from direct investments in regional development zones are totally deductible from the taxable income until the expiry of the period of five years (Group 1 zones listed by decree) or ten years (Group 2 zones listed by decree).
After the expiry of the exemption period, benefits derived from direct investment in development zones will be subject to CIT at the rate of 10% (PIT on revenues after deduction of 2/3).
It should be noted that, as per the Finance Law for 2019, for newly created entities in regional development zones incorporated in 2018, 2019, and 2020 that could benefit from a total exemption from CIT during four years starting from the activity start date, the total deduction period of five years or ten years provided for companies operating in regional developments zones is counted as from the expiry of the four-year exemption period.
#### Taxation of exceptional or auxiliary revenues/profits
Enterprises that invested in development zones may also benefit from the deduction and taxation at the reduced rate (after the expiry of total deduction period) for other profits in connection, with the same limits and conditions. The profits in question are detailed as follows:
### Tax incentives at the creation and capital increase phases
Profits/revenues invested in the subscription to initial capital or to capital increases of companies located in development areas are deductible from taxable profits/revenues at up to 100% of the taxable result. However, the deduction is subject to the conditions listed below:
### Other incentives
Enterprises that invested in development zones may also benefit from the exemption from social lodging tax and vocational training tax.
## Agricultural activities
The Tax Incentives Law provides that investments in the agricultural sector benefit from a number of tax incentives, detailed as follows:
### Tax incentives at the exploitation phase
#### CIT
Profits derived from direct investments in the agricultural sector are totally deductible from the taxable income during a period of ten years.
After the expiry of the ten-year exemption period, benefits derived from direct investment in the agricultural sector will be subject to CIT at the rate of 10% (PIT on revenues after deduction of 2/3).
#### Taxation of exceptional or auxiliary revenues/profits
Enterprises that invest in the agricultural industry may also benefit from the deduction and taxation at the reduced rate (after the expiry of total deduction period) for other profits in connection, with the same limits and conditions. The profits in question are detailed as follows:
Conditions for the benefit of the tax incentives:
### Tax incentives at the creation and capital increase phases
Profits/revenues invested in the subscription to initial capital or to capital increases of agricultural companies are deductible from taxable profits/revenues at up to 100% of the taxable result. However, the deduction is subject to the conditions for the benefit of the tax incentives listed *above*.
### Other incentives
The direct investments in Agricultural activities give entitlement to the following tax incentives (conditions and equipment listed by decree):
Also, registration duties paid on the transfer of agricultural land used for direct investment in the agricultural industry could be refunded on request (to be submitted within a three-year period).
The depollution activities are defined as being the collection, transformation, recovery, recycling, or treatment of waste and residues.
### Tax incentives at the exploitation phase
#### CIT
Conditions for the benefit of the tax incentives:
The Finance Law for 2023 increased the CIT rate from 10% to 15% for:
### Other incentives
## Newly created companies
### Tax incentives at the exploitation phase
Companies/enterprises newly created (except for those incorporated in the on-site consumption, trade, financial, energy other than renewable energy, and mining industries, telecommunication operators, and real estate developers) may benefit from the deduction of a portion of their taxable profits/revenues up the fourth year of activity as follows (subject to the below conditions):
Conditions for the benefit of the tax incentives:
Newly created companies incorporated in 2018, 2019, and 2020 benefit from a total exemption from CIT during four years starting from the activity start date (that should not exceed two years) subject to the submission of an investment declaration as provided by the investment law and to the maintenance of accounts in accordance with Tunisian GAAP. This measure does not involve companies operating in the financial sector, energy sector (except renewable energy), real estate development, on-site consumption, trade sectors, and telecommunication operators.
This measure does not cover:
Conditions for the benefit of this advantage:
The following conditions apply:
The Finance Law for 2023 increased the cap of TND 200,000 per year to TND 400,000 per year for R&D expenses incurred in the context of the green, blue, circular, and sustainable development economy.
Also, the Finance Law for 2023 provides that companies benefit from an additional deduction of 50% of innovation expenses, capped at TND 400,000 per year. The deductibility conditions of such a deduction will be fixed by decree.
Considering that the additional deduction represents a fictitious charge, which does not correspond to any current expense, it should be recorded in an extra-accounting manner through a deduction from the accounting result.
## Foreign tax credit
In the absence of DTTs, CIT (or any WHT in connection with) paid outside Tunisia is not deductible from the tax due in Tunisia.
However, in the presence of DTTs, in cases where profits derived from outside Tunisia were subject to CIT in Tunisia, the foreign tax, if any, is deductible, but only up to the corresponding Tunisian tax on these profits.
