## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
Resident companies are taxable in Kenya on income accrued or derived from Kenya. Resident companies with business activities outside Kenya are also taxed on income derived from business activities outside of Kenya.
Non-resident companies are subject to Kenya corporate income tax (CIT) only on the trading profits attributable to a Kenyan PE.
The CIT rate for resident companies, including subsidiaries of foreign parent companies is 30%.
The CIT rate for non residents including branches of foreign companies and PEs is also 30%.
##### The tax is applicable on deemed taxable profit which is 10% of the gross turnover.
