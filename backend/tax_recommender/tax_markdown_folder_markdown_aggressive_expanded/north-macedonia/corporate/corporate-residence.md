## Permanent establishment (PE)
Generally, a PE is a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on, either directly or through a dependent agent.
More specifically, the domestic law provides that a PE may include a place of management, a branch office, an office, a factory, a workshop, mining activities, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.
A building site or construction or installation project, as well as related supervision activities, may constitute a PE if it lasts longer than six months.
Furthermore, the provision of services, including consulting services with regard to one or several related projects, is deemed to give rise to a PE if such activities last longer than 90 continuous days within any 12-month period. If one or several persons establish a PE as per above, any other non-related project on which they are working on becomes part of the PE, irrespective of its duration.
The PE should be registered as a corporate taxpayer at the beginning of its activity in the country for the purposes of obtaining a tax number.
