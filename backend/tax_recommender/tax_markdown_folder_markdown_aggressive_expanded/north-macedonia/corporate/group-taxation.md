# North Macedonia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
There are no tax consolidation provisions in North Macedonia.
## Transfer pricing
### New transfer pricing legislation
The CIT Law and the Transfer Pricing Rulebook have introduced new provisions in respect of transfer prices applied between related parties from 1 January 2019 onwards. The above legislation prescribed detailed rules on transfer pricing, both in terms of substantial and transfer pricing reporting aspects.
### Transfer pricing reporting requirements
The amended tax legislation outlines new transfer pricing reporting requirements for taxpayers, as follows:
The above-mentioned transfer pricing reports should be prepared in Macedonian language and should be submitted to the tax authorities within 15 days of their request.
### Detailed definition of related parties
According to the new transfer pricing legislation, two persons would be considered as related in the following situations:

### Transfer pricing methods, comparables, and market range of comparables’ data
The new legislation prescribes five transfer pricing methods (instead of the previous two) that can be used for determination of the transfer price upon transactions with related parties.
The prescribed methods are:
The taxpayer should choose the most appropriate method in accordance with the arm’s-length principle and should choose a method for each type or category of transactions. If necessary, in specific cases, a combination of several methods may be used.
## Thin capitalisation
A proportional part of the interest related to a loan received from a non-resident shareholder, who directly holds at least 20% of the capital in the company, that exceeds three times its share in the equity in the company will be taxable during a tax period. Thin capitalisation rules also apply to loans from banks if they are granted in relation to a deposit of the shareholder in that particular bank. Note that thin capitalisation rules do not apply for newly established companies within the first three years of operation.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in North Macedonia.
