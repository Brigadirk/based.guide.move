PIT is payable on income irrespective of whether received in money, securities, in kind, or any other type of compensation.
## Income from work
Income from work is subject to taxation and is comprised of all income realised by the taxpayer based on employment, including income from contractual services. This income includes wages and salaries and other allowances realised based on employment; pensions; income of members of management and supervision bodies; salaries of officials, MPs, and advisors; salaries of professional athletes; allowances for jurors, forensic experts, and trustees; allowances of the members of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts; salary earned abroad based on employment in the country; allowances for interns according to the Internship Law; and every individual income realised based on temporary service contracts with legal entities and physical persons.
## Income from self-employment
Income from self-employment consists of income realised by individuals from business activities, registered agricultural business activity, or from rendering professional and other intellectual services, such as doctors, lawyers, public notaries, tax consultants, engineers, architects, accountants, etc. If several physical persons realise income from joint activity, each shall be subject to PIT on the share of the income attributable to a person in accordance to the agreement for joint activity.
## Income from copyrights and related rights
Income from copyrights is the compensation realised by the individual from artwork and related rights regulated under the Law on Copyrights and Related rights (e.g. paintings, artistic work in music, film, etc.). The tax base is decreased by the amount of recognised expenses that range between 20% and 50%.
## Income from sale of own agricultural products
Income from sale of one's own agricultural products consists of sale of own agricultural products to payers that keep accounting records and to natural persons if the sale took place outside organised green markets.
The tax base is 20% of the gross income realised.
The taxpayer whose total income in the year exceeds the amount of 1 million Macedonian denars (MKD) shall be required to register for business activity in accordance with the legislation by 15 January of the following year, at the latest.
If the taxpayer during the calendar year generates income from sale of one's own agricultural products not exceeding MKD 1 million, such taxpayer shall have the right to recover the tax paid thereof, provided the taxpayer has not realised any other income that is taxable under the PIT Law.
## Income from intellectual property (IP) rights
Income from IP rights is the compensation realised by the individual based on rights regulated with the Intellectual Property Rights Law. The tax base is 90% of the gross income.
## Income from lease and sub-lease of movables and immovable property
Income from lease and sub-lease of movables and immovable property is comprised of income earned by physical persons from lease and sub-lease of movables and immovable property, equipment, transportation vehicles, and other property. In case of a non-furnished property lease, the taxpayer is recognised a 10% deduction on the tax base for maintenance and management expenses. As for the lease of equipped residential and business premises, a 15% deduction on the tax base is recognised to the individual.
