## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Branches are taxed on the same basis as corporations. In addition, a 5% (reduced to 0% if paid out of income earned outside of Barbados as of 1 April 2018) withholding tax (WHT) is imposed on the transfer or deemed transfer to the head office of the after-tax profits that are not reinvested in Barbados, unless a DTA overrides this.
