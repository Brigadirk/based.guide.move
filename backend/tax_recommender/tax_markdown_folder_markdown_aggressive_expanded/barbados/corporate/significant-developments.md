## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Pillar two subject to tax rule
Barbados signed the Multilateral Convention to facilitate the implementation of the Pillar Two Subject to Tax Rule (STTR MLI) on 24 September 2024. The STTR is a treaty-based rule that protects the right of developing Inclusive Framework members to tax certain intra-group payments, where these are subject to a nominal corporate income tax that is below the minimum rate.
## Crypto-asset transparency and reporting
On 26 November 2024 , Barbados signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information under Crypto-Asset Reporting Freamework (CARF MCAA) and the Addendum to the CRS MCAA (CRS 2.0) at the 17th Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes Plenary Meeting .
The CARF MCAA establishes clear protocols for the automatic exchange of information on crypto-asset transactions, whereas the updated CRS Addendum strengthens reporting and due diligence requirements.  Barbados aims to implement the CARF MCAA framework in 2027, with the first exchange to occur in 2028.

## Group relief and change to tax loss carry forward period
The provisions for group relief will enable the current trading losses of a surrendering resident company to be set-off, by way of relief from CIT, against the profits of a claimant company, whether in whole or in part. Group relief is available under the following conditions:
