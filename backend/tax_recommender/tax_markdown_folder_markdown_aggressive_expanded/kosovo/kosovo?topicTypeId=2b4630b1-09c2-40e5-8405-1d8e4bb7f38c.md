## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
## Social security contributions
Both employer and employee are subject to compulsory pension contributions in Kosovo. The total compulsory contribution is 10%, where 5% represents the employee’s share (withheld from gross wages) and 5% the employer’s share.
Employers and employees may contribute additional pension contribution up to 30% (15%+15%).
## Consumption taxes
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Kosovo.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Assets received as a result of inheritance (regardless of value) if the person inheriting (i.e. the heir) is a spouse, biological or adopted child, or parent of the deceased are exempt from PIT.
In cases where the heir is a person other than the above-mentioned and the inherited value exceeds EUR 5,000, the amount above shall be taxed according to the PIT rates applicable (i.e. 0% to 10%).
Monetary gifts or gifts given as benefits in kind received by residents are treated as taxable income if the value of such gift exceeds EUR 5,000 in a tax period.
Gifts either monetary or as benefits in kind between spouses, a parent to their biological or legally adopted children, or from children to their parents are exempt from income regardless of the amount or value of the gift.
## Property taxes
## Luxury and excise taxes
