# Estonia
## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Exchange of information
Estonia has transposed the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) as well as Council directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation into domestic law. Estonian financial institutions covered by the CRS must annually report certain income and asset information on certain non-resident account holders to the Estonian tax authorities.
The first exchange of information took place in 2017.
## Company restructurings
In accordance with the EC Directive 2009/133/EC on mergers, divisions, partial divisions, transfers of assets, and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different member states, the mergers, divisions, and re-organisations of companies are generally tax-neutral in Estonia. The principle of going concern is applied in taxation of referred restructuring transactions.
