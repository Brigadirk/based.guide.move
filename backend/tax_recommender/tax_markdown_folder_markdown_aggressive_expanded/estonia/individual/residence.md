## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Individuals are considered residents of Estonia if they have a permanent residence in Estonia, their stay in Estonia during any 12-month period exceeds 183 days, or they are Estonian public servants who are sent abroad on assignment. An individual may be deemed to have become a tax resident from the date of one’s arrival to Estonia. For the purposes of determining the number of days, any part of a day counts as a full day.
The change of tax residence must be notified to the Tax and Customs Board.
