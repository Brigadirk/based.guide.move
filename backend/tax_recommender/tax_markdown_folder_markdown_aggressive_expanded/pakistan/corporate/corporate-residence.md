# Pakistan
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
A company is resident in Pakistan if it is incorporated or formed by or under the law of Pakistan or if the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in Pakistan in that year.
The term ‘company’ includes a trust, a cooperative society, a finance society, or any other society established or constituted by or under any law; a corporate body incorporated outside Pakistan; and any foreign association, incorporated or unincorporated, that the Federal Revenue authorities may declare to be a company.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
As per the local tax law, PE in relation to a person means a place of business through which the business of the person is wholly or partly carried on, and includes the following:
- in the name of the person
- for the transfer of the ownership of or for the granting of the right to use property owned by that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use, or
- for the provision of services by that person, or
For removal of doubt, it is clarified that an agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of business does not include a person acting exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of the person to which it is an associate.
For the removal of doubt, it is clarified that:
The definition of a PE provided in a double tax treaty (DTT) will prevail in cases where a DTT is executed by Pakistan with the related country of origin of the PE.
### Associates
Two persons shall be associates in the following instances:
Two persons shall not be associates solely by reason of the fact that one person is an employee of the other or both persons are employees of a third person.
Without limiting the generality of the descriptions above and below, the following shall be treated as associates:
Two persons shall not be associates under the first two bullet points above where the Commissioner is satisfied that neither person may reasonably be expected to act in accordance with the intentions of the other.
Under this scheme:
1. an ancestor, a descendant of any of the grandparents, or an adopted child of the individual or of a spouse of the individual, or
2. a spouse of the individual or of any person specified in (i).
## Business connection
Business income of a non-resident is, *inter-alia**,* considered to be Pakistan-sourced income to the extent to which it is directly or indirectly attributable to a ‘business connection’ in Pakistan. Through the Finance Act 2024, the concept of ‘business connection’ has been expanded to include ‘significant economic presence in Pakistan’ of a non-resident.
‘Significant economic presence in Pakistan’ has been defined as:
Non-resident persons covered by an applicable DTT shall not be affected by the above amendment as the provisions of the DTT override domestic tax legislation, subject to certain general anti-avoidance provisions.
