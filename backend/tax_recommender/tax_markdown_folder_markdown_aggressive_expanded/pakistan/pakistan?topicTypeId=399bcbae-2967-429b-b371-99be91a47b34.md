## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT (locally termed as ‘sales tax’) is ordinarily levied at 18% on the value of goods, unless specifically exempt or subject to sales tax at a reduced rate, after allowing related input credits.
Sales tax paid on services, federal sales tax on goods, and federal excise duty are adjustable against each other, with a few exceptions.
Supplies made by certain specific persons/sectors are subject to specific sales tax regimes (e.g. retail price/fixed tax regime) or otherwise subject to reduced rates of sales tax.
Commercial import of goods is subject to VAT at 3%, in addition to the sales tax payable at the standard rate at the import stage. Further tax of 4% is applicable in case of supplies to inactive taxpayers, subject to certain conditions.
## Customs and import duties
Customs and certain other duties are collected at the import stage at varying rates classified under the Harmonized System (HS) Code.
## Excise duty
## Property taxes
Property owners are required to pay property tax levied and collected by provincial governments through municipal governments at varying rates.
## Stamp duty
In the case of sale or transfer of immovable property, stamp duty is payable (with varying rates on the basis of location of the property) on the value of the property.
## Payroll taxes
Other than social security contributions (*see below*), employers are not responsible to pay any other tax in respect of their employees or their salaries.
## Social security contributions
