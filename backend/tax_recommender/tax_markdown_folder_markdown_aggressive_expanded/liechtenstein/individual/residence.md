Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Individuals are regarded as resident in Liechtenstein if they are residing within Liechtenstein with the intention of staying there permanently (domicile in Liechtenstein). In addition, individuals with habitual residence within Liechtenstein are deemed to be resident for tax purposes if they are residing in the country for more than six months.
