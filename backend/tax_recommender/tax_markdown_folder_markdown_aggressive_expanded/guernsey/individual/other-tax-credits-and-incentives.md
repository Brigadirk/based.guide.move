## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
The Bailiwick of Guernsey offers a number of tax incentives for individuals. They include tax relief in relation to interest on mortgages for a principal private residence. For the year of charge 2024, tax relief available for individuals is GBP 3,500.
Additionally, Guernsey resident individuals who are liable to pay tax on their worldwide income can elect to pay a 'standard charge' of GBP 40,000 (GBP 30,000 prior to 2021). The 'standard charge' is available to offset against any liability arising on Guernsey-source income.
