# Guernsey, Channel Islands
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 27 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Unilateral relief is available for tax paid in other jurisdictions at up to three-quarters of the lower of the effective rate of Guernsey tax and the overseas rate.
## Tax treaties
Guernsey has signed tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with 61 jurisdictions and full double taxation agreements (DTAs) with Cyprus, Estonia, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Qatar, Seychelles, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Guernsey entered into a DTT with Bahrain on 29 September 2024. However, the agreement has not yet come into effect.
Taxes paid in these jurisdictions, other than those paid on dividends or debenture interest, are allowed as a credit against Guernsey income tax payable. The provisions of Article 27, concerning assistance in the collection of taxes, entered into effect from 1 January 2022.
