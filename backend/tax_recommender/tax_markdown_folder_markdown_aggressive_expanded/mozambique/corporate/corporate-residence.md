# Mozambique
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Corporate residence is determined on the basis of a company’s place of incorporation or effective management. Thus, all companies with headquarters or effective management in Mozambique are considered tax residents and are liable for CIT on their worldwide income.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under the relevant Mozambican tax law, a non-resident entity is deemed to have a PE in Mozambique if it has any fixed place of business in Mozambique through which industrial, trading, agricultural, rendering of services, or similar activities are totally or partially carried out.
A fixed place of business comprises, among others, a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.
A non-resident entity is also deemed to have a PE in Mozambique if one of the following circumstances exists:
Generally, PE is not created as a result of preparatory or ancillary activities, such as:
Mozambique is among the few number of countries that is yet to accede to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Hence, the concept of PE is not aligned with BEPS Action 7 on Permanent Establishment Status.
