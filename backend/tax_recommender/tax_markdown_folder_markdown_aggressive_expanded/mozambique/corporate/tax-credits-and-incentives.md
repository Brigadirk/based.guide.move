## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Resident companies are allowed to deduct a credit correspondent to a tax paid abroad. The tax credit to be deducted should be equal to the lower of the amount of Mozambican CIT imputed to income obtained abroad or the amount of foreign tax effectively paid.
## Credit for domestic economic double taxation
When the taxpayer is not eligible for the participation exemption mechanism, they are required to include the profits distributed by resident entities in their taxable profits. In such cases and in order to mitigate the impact of economic double taxation, those taxpayers benefit from a tax credit to be deducted from the tax assessed, which corresponds to 60% of the CIT of the distributed profits that are included the taxable profits.
## General tax benefits and incentives
In addition to the guarantees of ownership and remittance of funds abroad, the Mozambican government also guarantees the concession of tax and customs incentives. The incentives vary depending on whether a company is starting a new venture or rehabilitating one and also on the nature of the project to be developed. The incentives discussed in this section are the generic benefits applicable to standard projects. Certain specific benefits also may be applicable depending on the activities of the industry for the investment project (e.g. agriculture, mining).
### Income taxes
#### Accelerated depreciation
Accelerated depreciation of new buildings used in the pursuit of the investment project, as well as rehabilitated buildings, machinery, and equipment intended for industrial or agro-industrial activities, by increasing the normal depreciation rates by 50%.
####
#### Tax deductible expenditures
####
#### Deductions to taxable income
Deductions to the taxable income of the amounts invested in (i) professional training of Mozambican employees and (ii) the modernisation and introduction of new technologies, up to a limit of 5% and 10%, respectively, during the first five years.
####
#### Investment tax credit
A carry-forwardable investment tax credit of 5% to 10% of the total investment realised on assets directly associated with the production activity of the operating company (depending on which location the project is implemented in), for a period of five years, to be offset against the gross income tax, up to its total amount.
