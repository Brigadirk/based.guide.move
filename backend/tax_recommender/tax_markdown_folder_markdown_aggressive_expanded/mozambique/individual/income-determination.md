## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Employment income
The tax concept of employment income is very broad, including salary and any fringe benefits (in kind or in cash) paid or granted by the employer to its employees. In general, all economic advantages provided to the employee arising from the employment or equivalent relationship are considered remuneration and taxed as employment income under the PIT Code.
With the exception of housing allowances, use of company paid houses, private use of a company car (if a written agreement is signed) attributed on an uncertain and irregular basis, and the gratifications paid by an entity other than the employer, all employment income is subject to monthly withholding taxes (WHTs) on a definitive and final basis, through application of tax rates from 10% to 32%, depending on the gross monthly amounts received and number of dependants, as follows:
| Monthly gross income (MZN) | Number of dependants | | | | | Coefficient applicable to every additional amount to the lower amount of income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4+ |
| Up to 20,249.99 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| From 20,250.00 to 20,749.99 | - | - | - | - | - | 0.10 |
| From 20,750.00 to 20,999.99 | 50 | 0 | - | - | - | 0.10 |
| From 21,000.00 to 21,249.99 | 75 | 25 | 0 | - | - | 0.10 |
| From 21,250.00 to 21,749.99 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 0 | - | 0.10 |
| From 21,750.00 to 22,249.99 | 150 | 100 | 75 | 50 | 0 | 0.10 |
| From 22,250.00 to 32,749.99 | 200 | 150 | 125 | 100 | 50 | 0.15 |
| From 32,750.00 to 60,749.99 | 1,775 | 1,725 | 1,700 | 1,675 | 1,625 | 0.20 |
| From 60,750.00 to 144,749.99 | 7,375 | 7,325 | 7,300 | 7,275 | 7,225 | 0.25 |
| More than 144,750.00 | 28,375 | 28,325 | 28,300 | 28,275 | 28,225 | 0.32 |
The income tax withheld by the employer shall be delivered to the Mozambican Tax Authority (MTA) up to the 20th day of the following month.
Individuals that only earn employment income that is subject to Mozambique WHT on a definitive basis are not required to file an annual income tax return, meaning that there is no additional payment or reimbursement of PIT in respect to employment income (if paid by a Mozambique resident entity).
For individuals that earn employment income that is not subject to definitive WHT in Mozambique and/or another type of income (rental, freelance income, capital gains, etc.), PIT is assessed on a yearly basis through the completion of the annual tax return (Form 10) in respect to the income obtained in the previous civil year and based on the annual tax rates varying from 10% to 32%, depending of the level of their annual taxable income. The annual tax return must be filed from January to April of the year following the year that income relates to.
