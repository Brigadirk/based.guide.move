# Trinidad and Tobago
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year corresponds to the calendar year in Trinidad and Tobago.
## Tax returns
Tax returns must be filed by 30 April of the year following the calendar or accounting year-end. An automatic six-month grace period is allowed, following which a penalty of TTD 100 accrues for every six months or part thereof that the return remains unfiled. Tax returns are filed for income earned in a calendar year (which coincides with the tax year) except in the case of a sole trader or partnership, where filing is done according to the accounting terminal date.
Resident individuals earning only employment income are not required to file a tax return.
Each individual must file a separate tax return. There is no provision for joint filing by husband and wife.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is deducted at source on all employment income under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. Any shortfall of taxes deducted at source should be settled by the due date (i.e. 30 April following the year of income).
