## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
## Employment expenses
An employed individual is not entitled to any blanket or standard deductions in computing taxable income. Such an individual may claim a deduction only for unreimbursed travel expenses incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the course of employment.
## Personal deductions
A resident individual is entitled to a deduction in respect of the following:
## Personal allowances
A personal allowance of TTD 90,000 is available to resident taxpayers. It is also available to non-residents who are in receipt of pension income accruing or derived from Trinidad and Tobago.
## Business deductions
A self-employed individual carrying on a trade, business, profession, or vocation may deduct those expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of such income.
Promotional expenses incurred by professionals in the construction sector or persons employed in agriculture in the expansion of existing markets or the creation of new markets for the export of services or locally produced goods are deductible as an expense at 150% of the actual outlay.
