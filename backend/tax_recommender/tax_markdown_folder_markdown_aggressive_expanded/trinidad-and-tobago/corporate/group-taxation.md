# Trinidad and Tobago
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
There is no provision for group taxation in Trinidad and Tobago; however, a limited form of group loss relief is available (*see Net operating losses in the [Deductions](deductions.html) section*).
## Transfer pricing
There are no specific transfer pricing rules in Trinidad and Tobago. However, the legislation empowers the tax authority to disregard any transactions that it views as artificial or fictitious. This general power has been utilised by the tax authority in dealing with related parties and large multinational companies to evaluate whether transactions are at arm’s length.
It should also be noted that the Minister of Finance recently announced the proposed enactment of Transfer Pricing (TP) laws which is expected to be introduced in 2025 and aligned to the OECD guidelines.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Trinidad and Tobago.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Trinidad and Tobago.
