### Special rules and rates
Special detailed rules and rates regarding national insurance contributions apply to irregular salary payments, the self-employed, and to other sources of income generated by an Israeli resident (i.e. rent, interest, dividends, pension, etc.). Capital gains are not subject to national insurance contributions.
## Health insurance tax
Health insurance tax is levied at 3.23% on the first ILS 7,522 and at 5.16% on the difference between ILS 7,522 and the maximum monthly compensation amount of ILS 50,695. Non-residents are not subject to health insurance tax.
Special detailed rules and rates regarding health insurance tax apply to irregular salary payments, the self-employed, and to other sources of income generated by an Israeli resident (i.e. rent, interest, dividends, pension, etc.). Capital gains are not subject to health insurance tax.
## Land appreciation tax (LAT)
LAT is imposed on gains from the sale of Israeli real estate. LAT is also imposed on the sale of an interest in a non-traded real estate association (REA), defined as a company or partnership whose principal assets consist of Israeli real estate. However, the tax liability arising from the sale of such an association will be determined based on the capital gains tax provisions of the Israeli ITO. For LAT purposes, a sale includes most types of dispositions, as well as the grant of a lease capable of lasting for 25 years or more.
In measuring the lease period, an option to lease is considered as if exercised. Detailed expenditure deduction rules are prescribed for LAT purposes.
The resulting taxable capital gain is divided into real and inflationary elements.
The real capital gain is taxable as follows (these guidelines do not apply with respect to the sale of residential apartments in Israel - detailed rules apply):
### Assets purchased from 1 January 2012 and thereafter
The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in real estate for individuals is 25%. The tax rate applicable to real capital gains derived from the sale of an interest in an REA is 25%, or 30% in the case of a 10% or more shareholder.
### Assets purchased prior to 1 January 2012
### Surtaxes
As of 2025, the portion of an individual's taxable annual income from capital sources (e.g., capital gains, real estate appreciation, dividends, interest, CPI linkage differentials, rental income, passive royalties, etc.) exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025) is subject to an additional surtax of 2%. This is in addition to 3% surtax on an individual's annual taxable income from all sources exceeding a certain threshold (NIS 721,560 in 2025).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Israel does not have a net wealth/worth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Israel does not have any estate or inheritance taxation.
Israel does not impose a special gift tax on the gifting of assets.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are generally imposed on the occupier of commercial and residential property. Unoccupied property is generally taxed on the property's owner. The tax is imposed at the municipality level.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Israel imposes an additional 3% on personal income at the highest marginal rate (which increases the highest tax marginal rate from 47% to 50%).
A luxury tax is also imposed on the purchase of certain yachts and luxury cars.
Israel imposes excise taxes on a variety of goods (e.g. gasoline and diesel fuel used for transportation, tobacco, alcohol). The excise taxes are levied item-by-item, and the rates vary.
