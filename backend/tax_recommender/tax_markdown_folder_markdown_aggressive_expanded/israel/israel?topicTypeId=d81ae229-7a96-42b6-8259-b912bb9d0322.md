## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Under Israeli domestic tax law, WHT on payments of Israeli-source income is generally deducted at the corporate tax rate from all income remittances abroad, unless a tax certificate is obtained from the ITA authorising withholding-exempt remittances or a reduced rate of tax pursuant to an applicable tax treaty.
Set out below is a listing of WHT rates for dividends, interest, and royalties under domestic tax law and pursuant to tax treaties in force. Detailed rules apply under certain tax treaties for eligibility to the treaty-reduced rates (e.g. beneficial ownership, having no PE in Israel). The applicable tax treaty should be consulted to determine the relevant WHT rate and to examine detailed conditions that may apply for the specific circumstance.
Israel has adopted the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) amendments to tax treaties. The changes to the DTTs provided for in the MLI will generally apply for those Israeli treaties when the country treaty partner has also ratified the MLI in their respective country and for those provisions on which both countries have not submitted reservations to the OECD. Therefore, in examining treaty eligibility for reduced WHT rates, it is important to examine the relevant treaty together with its MLI amendments as applicable (e.g. amended provisions regarding residency).
