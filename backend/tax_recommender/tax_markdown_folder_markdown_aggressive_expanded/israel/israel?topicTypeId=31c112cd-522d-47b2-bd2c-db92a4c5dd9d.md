## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Taxable period
Tax returns are filed on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
Subject to certain exceptions, *as detailed below*, an individual who is a resident of Israel is required to file an annual tax return. Should a tax return be required, 30 April is the prescribed filing due date, subject to extensions.
A resident taxpayer may not be required to file a tax return for 2025 where tax is withheld at source from one’s wages and at the prescribed levels from other specified sources (e.g. rent, dividends, interest, and capital gains) unless one of the following exceptions apply, in which case the individual would be required to file a tax return (detailed rules apply; certain further exceptions may also be applicable):
These amounts are periodically updated.
Married couples are permitted to file separate or joint returns. In the latter case, a separate calculation may still be obtained for tax on income from personal exertion in any business or vocation or from employment, provided the income is from independent sources.
A non-Israeli tax resident employee will generally not be required to file an Israeli income tax return for 2025 if proper withholdings were remitted to the tax authorities, the employee's 2025 annual income did not exceed ILS 721,560, and the employee had no other Israeli-source income.
## Payment of tax
Payroll withholding of income and social tax is statutory, irrespective of the residence of the employer or employee. In general, withholding taxes in respect of salary payments effected from the 14th day of one month to the 13th day of the following month are payable on the 15th day of that following month.
Tax advances are required to be paid by an individual for interest, dividends, capital gains, and rental income in amounts and according to specific deadlines set out in detailed Israeli tax rules.
Self-employed individuals are generally required to make monthly or bimonthly advance tax payments, usually based on a percentage of turnover.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation period for taxation of individuals is generally four years from the end of the tax year in which the relevant tax return is filed.
