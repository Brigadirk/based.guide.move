## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
The following are considered to be resident in Israel:
In the absence of a definition of the term ‘management and control’ either in Israeli legislation or a direct discussion of this term by the Israeli courts, it may be difficult to determine whether a company that is incorporated outside of Israel shall be viewed as managed and controlled from Israel. This is a complex subject that needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. When an entity is both an Israeli tax resident and a resident of a foreign jurisdiction that is party to an income tax treaty with Israel, most treaties provide a tiebreaker test in the determination of an entity’s tax residency.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Foreign resident entities might be exempt from corporate tax to the extent that its activities do not constitute a PE under the tax treaty applicable between Israel and the foreign resident’s country of residency.
Whether a non-resident has a taxable presence under Israeli domestic tax law is far less clear than the definition of PE under a relevant tax treaty. There is no detailed legislation or Israeli court decisions that directly address this issue. In general, where there is no tax treaty protection, a non-resident is subject to tax on income accrued or derived in Israel, which is a taxation threshold lower than the PE criterion.
