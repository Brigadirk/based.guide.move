# Honduras
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Honduran resident companies are taxed on territorial income. Non-resident companies are subject to Corporate Income Tax (CIT) only on income derived from Honduran sources.
The CIT rate for a resident company is 25% of its net taxable income.
Foreign entities providing sea, land, and aerial transport services in Honduras should consider a net taxable income equivalent to 10% of their total Honduran-source gross income in order to apply the correspondent income tax rate.
## Minimum tax
Individuals or entities who have obtained gross income greater 1 billion Honduran lempiras (HNL) in the previous fiscal period must pay 1% of the aforementioned income when the application of the indicated rates in Section 22 of the Honduran Income Tax Law are less than 1% of declared gross income.
The rate will be reduced to 0.50% for the following sectors: production, distribution, or commercialisation of cement, steel, and their derivatives for construction, which does not include scrap metal sales or the activity of the mining industry; public services provided by state companies; drugs and pharmaceutical products for human use, at the level of producer, importer, or marketer; and production, commercialisation, or coffee exportations.
## Solidarity Contribution
The Solidarity Contribution is a non-deductible surcharge levied on all companies on taxable income over HNL 1 million. The Solidarity Contribution tax rate is 5%.
## Income tax anti-evasion measures
A law created in response to tax evasion and fraud establishes payment of an income tax of 1% on gross income equal to or greater than HNL 100 million for all taxpayers who report losses for two years in a row or two out of five. The 1% tax paid will be considered as a credit in the resulting income tax, surtax, or net asset payable in the annual returns. There are some exemptions to the rule.
## Municipal income taxes
### Industry, commerce, and services tax
Companies doing business in Honduras are levied the following municipal tax on annual gross income:
| From (HNL) | To (HNL) | Range (HNL) | Tax per ´000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
