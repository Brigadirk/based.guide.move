## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Companies operating under a special tax regime are exempted from CIT, sales tax, customs duties, and some municipal taxes. These special tax regimes are the following:
Companies must comply with some governmental requirements to operate under one of the above-mentioned special regimes.
Companies under special tax regimes are allowed to sell their partial or total production in the local market; income from local sales will be subject to the regular corporate tax regulations.
The term of tax exoneration is limited to 12 years to those companies under special tax regimes with no specific term for their tax benefits specified in their corresponding resolution issued by the government.
The Law for the Promotion and Protection of Investment (*Ley para la Promoción y Protección de las Inversiones*) was amended, establishing a 15-year term for tax stability agreements, except for Public and Private Alliances projects. At the same time, it repeals the special income tax discounts granted by this law.
Special benefits exist for industries that import semi-manufactured materials for assembly in Honduras and export finished products. Benefits consist of duty-free imports of raw materials for subsequent export as manufactured products. Machinery for these industries may also be imported duty-free.
## Foreign tax credit
There are no provisions for foreign tax credits in Honduras.
