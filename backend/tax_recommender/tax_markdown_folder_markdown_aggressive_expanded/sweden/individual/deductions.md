## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment expenses
In principle, all expenses incurred during the fulfilment of the employment agreement are deductible (e.g. travel expenses, automobile expenses, living allowances on business trips, necessary literature, tools of the trade). The deduction related to cost-of-living allowances is, however, limited.
## Personal deductions
### Interest expenses
Interest costs paid to Swedish or non-Swedish lenders are deductible.
### Management costs
Management costs for the administration of investments are no longer deductible as from 1 January 2016.
### Pension insurance premiums and contributions
Personal pension insurance premiums and contributions to restricted pension savings accounts are deductible within certain limits, but only if the employee is not included in an employer funded company pension plan.
## Personal allowances
From the aggregate taxable income, basic allowance of SEK 16,800 to SEK 44,800 (2024) is granted.
## Losses
Losses from the sale of private real property, securities, etc. are generally only 50% or 70% deductible. A tax credit may be applicable in certain instances (*see the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*).
