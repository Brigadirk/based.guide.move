Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Taxes paid by resident taxpayers on foreign-source salary will be allowed as a credit against Cambodian salary tax on presentation of documentation confirming payment. The credit allowed is the amount of foreign tax paid or the proportion of salary tax on salary from all sources attributable to the foreign-source income, whichever is lower.
