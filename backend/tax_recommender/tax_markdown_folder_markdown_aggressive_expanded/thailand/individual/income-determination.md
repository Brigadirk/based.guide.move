## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 17 January 2025
## Employment income
Both resident and non-resident individuals who receive assessable income by virtue of hire of service performed in Thailand, including salary, bonuses, gratuities, pensions, the monetary value of rent-free housing, the employer’s payment of income tax, or any other money, property, or benefits derived by virtue of hire of service, are subject to tax in Thailand, regardless of whether the income is paid within or outside Thailand. There are no concessions to foreigners or short-term residents.
## Capital gains
Most types of capital gains are taxable as ordinary income. However, the following capital gains are exempt from tax:
Capital gains and investment income earned by a resident from sources outside Thailand are not taxable unless remitted to Thailand in the year of receipt.
Capital losses may not be offset against capital gains.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from a company incorporated in Thailand are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at a flat rate of 10%. A resident of Thailand receiving dividends from companies incorporated in Thailand may elect to exclude this income from the computation of income tax and waive the tax credit *referred to in the [Other tax credits and incentives](other-tax-credits-and-incentives.html) section*.
## Interest income
Interest received from bank deposits, loans to finance companies, debentures, and bills issued by a corporate entity is subject to WHT at a flat rate of 15%. Individuals may choose to exclude interest income from other income, in which case they pay the 15% WHT, or they may choose to include such interest income with other income and pay tax according to the PIT rates, in which case the tax withheld at source is credited against the tax liability.
## Cryptocurrencies and digital tokens
The share of profits or any benefits from holding or possessing digital tokens, or gains from the transfer of cryptocurrencies or digital tokens, are subject to a WHT at a flat rate of 15%.
However, there is an exemption for profit sharing or benefits derived by individuals from holding or possessing investment tokens. The exemption applies to profit sharing or benefits received from 1 January 2024 onwards, provided that the taxpayer does not claim a refund or credit for the tax withheld, which is set at 15%.
## Gifts
PIT is levied on gifts given by persons who are still alive. The tax is collected on the assets or the amount given to parents, ascendants, descendants, spouse, or others based on the value of the gift that exceeds a prescribed threshold, which depends on the type of gift and donor. Assets or amounts given that do not exceed the threshold are exempt from tax.
The following gifts are exempt from PIT:
Gifts in excess of the above thresholds will be subject to PIT at the rate of 5% and will not need to be included together with other income when computing the annual PIT liability.
## Exempt income
Furthermore, provided certain conditions are met, gains or benefits from registered provident funds, retirement mutual funds, long-term equity funds, and national saving funds, including amounts derived from insurance or social security funds, are also tax exempt.
