## Decree Law for Family Economy
The Decree Law for Family Economy, in force since June 2023, incorporates reforms to the personal expenses regulations.
For individuals without dependants, the reduction amount for personal expenses is equivalent to 18% of the lower value between the personal expenses declared in the respective fiscal year and the value of the basic family basket multiplied by seven.
Likewise, for individuals with dependants, the amount of the personal expense reduction is equivalent to 18% of the lower amount between the personal expenses declared in the respective fiscal year and the basic family basket multiplied by the number of baskets corresponding to the number of dependants, according to the following table:
| Number of dependants | Number of basic family baskets |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 9 |
| 2 | 11 |
| 3 | 14 |
| 4 | 17 |
| 5 or more | 20 |
The Economic Efficiency and Employment Generation Law of December 2023 establishes that for individuals economically responsible for individuals with disabilities and catastrophic, rare, and/or orphan diseases the amount of the reduction for personal expenses will be equivalent to 18% of the lower value between the personal expenses reported in the respective fiscal year and the value of the basic family basket multiplied by 100.
