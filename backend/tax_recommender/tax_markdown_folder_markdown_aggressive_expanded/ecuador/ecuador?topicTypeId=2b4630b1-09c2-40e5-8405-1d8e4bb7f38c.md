# Ecuador
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions must be paid to the Ecuadorian Social Security System. There are two different rates, according to the individuals' employment relationship.
Private employees under a labour relationship will contribute at the rate of 9.45% of remuneration arising from employment (except certain statutory social benefits received). Special rates apply to employees working on special sectors of the economy. Voluntary contributors must pay a rate of 17.6% over their income.
The employer contribution amounts to 12.15% of total remuneration.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
No VAT applies on employment services under a labour relationship. Personal services provided under a professional fee contract relationship are subject to VAT at 15%, which, when provided to companies, is subject to 100% withholding by them.
Professionals are required to file VAT returns.
## Municipal taxes
### Municipal asset tax
The municipal asset tax is levied on all individuals and companies required to keep accounting records in accordance with Ecuadorian tax legislation. This tax is levied annually at a rate of 1.5 per thousand (or 0.15%) of total assets less current and contingent liabilities, as shown on the balance sheet.
### Municipal real estate tax
The city governments assess an annual municipal property tax, which ranges between 0.25 per thousand and 5 per thousand (0.025% to 0.5%) of the commercial value of the property, as determined by valuation carried out by the city government, for both urban and rural properties (rural property is taxed at a maximum of 0.3%).
### Municipal tax on capital gain in the transfer of real estate (Plusvalía)
10% real estate transfer tax applies to the transfer of urban real estate property.
