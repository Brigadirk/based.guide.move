## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
Deductible expenses must be non-capital in nature and incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes. Specific provisions, such as for bad debts, are deductible subject to the Commissioner - General's approval.
## Depreciation and amortisation
While accounting depreciation and amortisation are not deductible, a 'capital allowance' is available for qualifying capital assets used in business operations.
Zambia has a system of capital allowances that provides for wear and tear deductions in ascertaining business income. These are calculated at annual rates on qualifying capital expenditure, which currently apply as follows:
| Category of qualifying expenditure | Rate of allowance (calculated on a straight-line basis) |
| --- | --- |
| Industrial buildings | Investment allowance of 10% \* |
| Initial allowance of 10% \* |
| Annual wear and tear allowance of 5% \* |
| Other commercial buildings | Annual wear and tear allowance of 2% |
| Implements, machinery, and plant - farming and agro-processing | Annual wear and tear allowance of 100% |
| Implements, machinery, and plant - for persons operating in priority sector and a developer in a special economic zone | Annual wear and tear allowance of 100% |
| Implements, machinery, and plant - manufacturing, tourism, generation of electricity, and leasing | Annual wear and tear allowance of 50% |
| Implements, machinery and plant - other | Annual wear and tear allowance of 25% |
| Commercial vehicles | Annual wear and tear allowance of 25% |
| Non-commercial vehicles | Annual wear and tear allowance of 20% |
| Patents, designs, trademarks, and copyrights | Premium allowance on straight-line basis over the life of period for which the right is granted |
| Mining expenditure (only available for assets brought into use) | Mining deductions of 20% |
| Farm improvements | Farm improvement allowance of 100% |
\* For industrial buildings, the investment allowance and the initial allowance can both be claimed in the year in which the building is put into use, together with the wear and tear allowance for that year.
