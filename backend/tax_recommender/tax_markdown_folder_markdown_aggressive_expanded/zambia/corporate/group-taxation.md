# Zambia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 May 2024
There are no consolidated CIT returns for groups.
Losses in one group company cannot offset profits in another.
## Transfer pricing
Transactions must be at arm's-length. Non-compliance can lead to income adjustments and avoidance penalties.
Companies must maintain transfer pricing documentation for ten years.
Non-compliance penalties can reach ZMW 24 million.
## International compliance
From 2021, multinationals with revenues over ZMW 4,795 million must submit Country-by-Country (CbC) Reports within 12 months post-financial year.
Zambia joined the OECD Global Forum to combat tax evasion and enhance financial transparency, committing to EOIR and AEOI standards.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest deductibility is limited to 30% of tax EBITDA, excluding turnover tax system businesses and those under the Banking and Financial Services Act.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Zambia does not have a CFC regime.
