## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation of depreciable assets in the accounts of a business is not an allowable deduction in computing taxable profits. It is instead replaced by capital allowances at prescribed statutory rates, as follows:
| Class | Assets | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Assets pooled (allowance calculated on a reducing-balance basis). Mainly computers and data handling equipment together with peripheral devices. | 40% |
| 2 | Assets pooled (allowance calculated on a reducing-balance basis). Mainly automobiles, buses, mini buses, construction and earth-moving equipment, trailers and trailer-mounted containers, plant and machinery used in manufacturing. | 30% |
| 3 | Assets pooled (allowance calculated on a reducing-balance basis). Mainly railroad cars, locomotives and equipment, vessels and similar water transportation equipment, aircraft, public utility plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and any other depreciable asset not elsewhere classified. | 20% |
| 4 | Buildings, structures, and similar works of a permanent nature (allowance calculated using the straight-line method). | 10% |
| 5 | Intangible assets. | Useful life |
|  | Mining and petroleum expenditure (allowance calculated using the straight-line method). | 20% |
|  | Machinery and equipment imported in order to affix the excise tax stamp on excisable goods by an importer or manufacturer of excisable goods (allowance calculated using the straight-line method). | 50% |
Allowances are granted only on the following conditions:
For intangibles, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights, the law allows for capital allowance deduction over the useful life of the asset.
## Start-up expenses and pre-operating costs
Although the tax law does not specifically mention start-up expenses or pre-operating costs, generally a deduction is allowed for start-up and pre-operating costs incurred by a business, provided such expenses are wholly, exclusively, and necessarily incurred in the production of income of the taxpayer.
## Interest expenses
Interest incurred on loans used to generate the income of a business is ordinarily deductible. Restrictions apply on interest payments on related loans. *See Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*
## Financial costs
Deductions for financial costs other than interest are limited to the sum of:
## Bad debts
A deduction is allowed for bad debts incurred in the normal course of business, other than advances made on capital accounts. A bad debt is allowed as a deduction if the Commissioner-General of the GRA is satisfied that the taxpayer has taken all reasonable steps to pursue payment and the person reasonably believes payment will not be made.
Any amounts recovered in respect of a bad debt previously written off should be included in income and subject to tax accordingly.
An existing debt that becomes a bad debt after a 50% or more change in underlying ownership is not allowed as a bad debt deduction after the change in ownership has taken place.
## Charitable contributions
The following contributions/donations are allowable as deductions in ascertaining the taxable income of a person:
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties arising as a result of non-compliance with the provisions of the tax law are generally not allowable deductions.
## Taxes
Any income taxes, profit taxes, or other similar taxes are not deductible in determining taxable income.
## Other significant items
No other special deductions are allowed. Principal non-deductible expenses include the following:
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for all sectors and deducted from assessable income for the five years immediately following the year in which the loss was incurred.
Carryback of losses is permitted for persons deriving income relating to a long-term contract (except where there is a more than 50% change in underlying ownership within a period of three years).
A long-term contract of a business includes a contract for manufacture, installation, or construction that is not completed within the company's accounting year in which it is commenced.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The Transfer Pricing Regulations 2020, (L.I. 2412) require that payments or transactions between persons in a controlled relationship are conducted at arm's length. A transaction is conducted at arm’s length between persons in a controlled relationship if the terms of the transaction do not differ from the terms of a comparable transaction between independent persons. The Commissioner-General of the GRA may disregard or disallow transactions if they are deemed to be fictitious or do not have a substantial economic effect and the form does not reflect its substance.
A person is deemed to be in a controlled relationship with an entity where the person has, directly or indirectly, at least 25% of the voting rights of the entity.
