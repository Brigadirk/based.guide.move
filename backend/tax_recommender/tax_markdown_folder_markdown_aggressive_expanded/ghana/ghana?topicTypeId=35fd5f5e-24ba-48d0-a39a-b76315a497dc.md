## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
Ghana taxes its resident individuals on income from any employment, business, or investment, whether or not the source from which the income is derived has ceased.
Resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, and, as such, foreign-sourced income is taxable.
However, an exemption exists for employment income of a resident individual who exercises one's employment outside Ghana and is employed by a non-resident employer or by a resident employer, where that individual is present outside Ghana for more than 183 days.
The following are examples of income from employment, business, and investment a resident individual is taxed on:
## Personal income tax rates
Residents are subject to tax at rates ranging between 0% and 35% on the following annual graduated scale of income:
| Chargeable income (GHS) | Rate of tax (%) |
| --- | --- |
| First 5,880 | 0 |
| Next 1,320 | 5.0 |
| Next 1,560 | 10.0 |
| Next 38,000 | 17.5 |
| Next 192,000 | 25.0 |
| Next 366,240 | 30.0 |
| Exceeding 600,000 | 35.0 |
Non-residents pay taxes at the flat rate of 25%.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on personal income in Ghana.
