# Ghana
## Overview
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
Well-endowed with natural resources, Ghana has roughly twice the *per capita* output of other countries in the West Africa sub-region. In terms of its political terrain, Ghana has a stable multiparty constitutional democracy founded on elections by open and free universal adult suffrage. The country has witnessed three smooth transitions of change of governments in the current democratic dispensation. The main arms of government are the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary, each of which is independent of the other. At the local level, the District Assemblies are to be the highest political and administrative authority in each district, with deliberative, executive, and legislative powers.
Gold, cocoa, and oil productions, as well as remittances from citizens working abroad, are the major sources of foreign currency.
Ghana’s domestic economy continues to revolve around agriculture, which accounts for more than a third of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs more than half of the workforce, mainly small landholders.
