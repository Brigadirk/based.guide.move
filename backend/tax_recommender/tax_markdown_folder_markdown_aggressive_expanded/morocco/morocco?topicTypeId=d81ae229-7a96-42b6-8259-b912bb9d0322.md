# Morocco
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
## WHT on dividends
The WHT rate applicable to income from shares, units, and similar income is set at 12.5% for FY 2024.
The WHT rate will progressively evolve, from 2023 to 2026, until it reaches 10%.
## WHT on interests
The standard WHT on interest paid to non-resident entities is set at 10% as provided by the Moroccan law (unless reduced by treaty). However, the Moroccan law provides that interest on loans granted in foreign currency with a maturity exceeding ten years is exempt from WHT.
## WHT on services paid to non-resident entities
According to the Moroccan Tax Code, all payments of all kinds of services rendered by non-resident entities are subject to WHT at the rate of 10%.
However, it shall be noted that treaty dispositions limit the scope of application of WHT only to remunerations that constitute royalties. Such dispositions overrule the domestic tax law provided by the Moroccan law.

5. The lower rate of 5% applies for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
