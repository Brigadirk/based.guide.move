## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 26 July 2024
The categories of revenues and capital gains subject to IIT are the following:
## Salary revenues
The net taxable salary corresponds to the gross wage, including benefits and payments in kind or cash, granted to the employee reduced by the amount of social security contributions.
Some exemptions are provided (e.g. allowances granted to cover employment expenses).
### Pension revenues
Finance Laws 2020 and 2023 set a progressive scale for the deductions applied to pension revenues as follows:
Individuals resident in Morocco benefit from a reduction of 80% of IIT relating to pensions of foreign source duly repatriated to Morocco.
## Professional revenues
Under the standard regime, the tax basis of professional revenues is the difference between trading income and expenditure.
## Revenues derived from agricultural farms
### Low-scale individual farmers
Individual farmers that realise annual turnover of less than MAD 5 million qualify for a total exemption of IIT starting from 1 January 2014. If such individuals realise turnover that exceeds MAD 5 million in say year (n), they become liable to IIT in year (n), year (n+1), year (n+2), and year (n+3).
Moreover, such individuals qualify for a reduced rate of 20% during the first five fiscal years following the first year during which they become liable to IIT.
### Medium and large-scale individual farmers
Finance Law 2014 provides for a progressive approach to tax medium and large-scale individual farmers that realise annual turnover exceeding MAD 5 million.
As such, the above individuals realising annual turnover that exceeds MAD 35 million, MAD 20 million, or MAD 10 million should become liable to IIT, respectively, in 2016, 2018, and 2020.
Moreover, such individuals qualify for a reduced rate of 20% during the first five fiscal years following the first year during which they become liable to IIT.

### Real estate capital gains
Capital gains earned from the sale of properties by individuals are subject to a flat rate of 20% of capital gains. The tax amount cannot be lower than 3% of the selling price.
The capital gain derived from the sale of real estate is calculated as follows:
Capital gain = (selling price - selling expenses) - (updated purchasing price + purchasing expenses)
