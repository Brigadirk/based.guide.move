Companies are taxed on the difference between their trading income and expenditure. Business expenses incurred in the operation of the business are generally deductible unless specifically excluded.
The CIT rates applicable for FY 2024 are as follows:
| Taxable income (MAD) | | CIT rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | To |
| 0 | 300,000 | 15.0 |
| 300,001 | 1,000,000 | 20.0 |
| 1,000,001 | Lower than 100,000,000 | 25.5 |
| 100,000,000 | or more | 33.0 |

These measures are applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2023.
The minimum contribution is not due during the first 36 months following the beginning of activities.
