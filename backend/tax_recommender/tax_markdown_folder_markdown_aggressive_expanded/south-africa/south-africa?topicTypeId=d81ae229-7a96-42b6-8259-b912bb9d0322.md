# South Africa
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
## Payments to residents
The only payments to residents that are subject to WHT are in respect of dividends, although dividend distributions to South African resident companies are exempt from dividends tax.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
South Africa ratified the BEPS MLI in September 2022.
The MLI entered into force for South Africa on 1 January 2023 and applies to South Africa’s 'Covered Tax Agreements' that are affected:
There are slightly different effective dates for the modifications in respect of dispute resolution.
## Royalties payable to non-residents
Royalties and know-how payments made to non-residents for the use of or right to use IP rights in South Africa are deemed to be from an SA source. The payer of the royalty or know-how payment is obligated to deduct a WHT of 15% of this payment, which is a final tax payable by the recipient of such income.
## Dividends payable to non-residents
A dividend WHT of 20% applies to any dividend paid by a resident company to a non-resident or by a non-resident company to a non-resident where the shares in respect of which the dividends are paid are listed on a South African exchange. The tax is imposed on the beneficial owner of the dividend and not on the company, with the exception of *in specie* dividends. The payer of the dividend or regulated intermediary is required to deduct the 20% WHT from the payment.
## Interest payable to non-residents
A 15% WHT on interest applies to interest payable from an SA source to non-residents on certain debt instruments. The resident payer of the interest is required to deduct the 15% WHT from the payment.
## Service fees payable to non-residents
No domestic WHT is levied on fees payable to non-residents.
## Treaty rates for dividends, interest, and royalties
The WHT may be reduced by the terms of the relevant tax treaty, as shown below.
Note that the treaty rate is the maximum allowable rate to be charged by the treaty countries; where this rate is higher than the domestic tax rate, the latter will apply.
