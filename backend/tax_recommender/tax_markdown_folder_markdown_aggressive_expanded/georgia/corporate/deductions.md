## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
The concept of deduction is no longer applicable for the companies and PEs operating under the new CIT system, since they follow IFRS.
Under the old CIT system, expenses connected with the receipt of income generally are deductible from income, provided sufficient primary documentation is available.
## Depreciation
A taxpayer is entitled to fully deduct costs of fixed assets (excluding those contributed to capital) in the year when the fixed assets are put into operation (a form of capital allowance). In case the taxpayer employs the right of full deduction in this manner, this method may not be changed for five years.
## Amortisation of intangible assets
Intangible assets (e.g. goodwill) are amortisable in proportion with the period of beneficial use. However, intangible assets of value less than GEL 1,000 are fully deductible from gross income.
If the period of beneficial use of an intangible asset cannot be defined, it is amortisable at the rate of 15%.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred before registration of an entity as a taxpayer (e.g. public registry fee) are not deductible under Georgian tax legislation.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on loans is deductible within the limits established by the Finance Minister, unless it is paid on loans received from domestic licensed banks and microfinance organisations. The annual deductible interest rate limitation established by the Minister of Finance of Georgia for the year 2020 is 24%. No limits are established on loans received from domestic licensed banks and microfinance organisations.
## Bad debt
A taxpayer is entitled to deduct bad debt only if all of the following conditions are met:
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are deductible, up to 10% of taxable profit.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties paid to the state budget are not deductible.
## Taxes
CIT is disallowed for deduction.
## Other significant items
The following other expenses are not deductible:
The deduction of certain expenses is subject to limitations, including:
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for five years but may not be carried back.
A taxpayer may elect to extend the carryforward period to 10 years. However, this also results in the statute of limitations period being extended from 6 to 11 years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There is no special tax regime in Georgia for payments made to foreign affiliates; as such, general rules will apply. Payments may be classified as equity, financing, or service fee. Any such transaction will need to be at arm’s length in accordance with the Georgian transfer pricing rules.
