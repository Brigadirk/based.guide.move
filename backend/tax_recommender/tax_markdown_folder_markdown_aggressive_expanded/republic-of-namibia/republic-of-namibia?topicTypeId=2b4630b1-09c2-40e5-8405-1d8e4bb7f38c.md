## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Social security contributions
Namibia has a limited social security system. The Maternity Leave, Sick Leave, and Death Benefit Fund are compulsory for all employees. It is funded by employer and employee contributions of 0.9% of the basic salary, with a maximum contribution of NAD 81 per month each (i.e. the total monthly contribution of both the employer and the employee will amount to NAD 162).
### Workmen's compensation
Under the Employees Compensation Act, employers are required to contribute to a fund that provides cash benefits for industrial injury, disability, and death. Contribution rates vary according to inherent occupational risk, from less than 1% in most low-risk commercial/administrative occupations to 8% for high-risk sectors (drilling, tunnelling, and rock-blasting). Employees whose annual remuneration exceeds NAD 81,300 are normally excluded from coverage.
