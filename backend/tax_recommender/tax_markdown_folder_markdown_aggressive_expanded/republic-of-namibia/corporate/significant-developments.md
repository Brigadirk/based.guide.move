# Namibia, Republic of
## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Income tax amendments
The following income tax amendments were gazetted on 16 September 2024 and are effective for all companies with financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2024:
The following should be noted:
(A/B) \* C - C
Whereas:
‘A’ represents 50%
‘B’ represents the CIT rate (31%), and
‘C’ represents the costs incurred *per annum* or 50,000 Namibian dollars (NAD), whichever is the lesser.
This means that if the taxpayer has taxable income of less than NAD 1 million, the full prior year tax loss can be carried forward and can be used to set off against the current year’s taxable income.
The balance of assessed loss accumulated before 1 January 2024 can be carried forward for five/ten years.
## Value-added tax (VAT) amendments
Some major changes were introduced by the VAT Amendment Act, 2024, published 16 September 2024. These amendments take effect on the first day of the second month following the publication of the Amendment Act, 2024 (i.e. on 1 November 2024):
