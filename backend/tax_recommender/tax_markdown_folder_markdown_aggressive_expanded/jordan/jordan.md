# Jordan
## Overview
Last reviewed - 11 February 2025
Jordan is a constitutional monarchy in Western Asia, having gained independence in 1946. It is divided into 12 governorates, with Amman as its capital. Despite limited natural resources, Jordan’s economy has shown steady growth since 2003, with a projected GDP growth rate of 2.8% in 2023. The economy is primarily driven by the manufacturing and services sectors, with key exports including chemical products, clothing, and apparel. Tourism and foreign investment also play significant roles in economic growth. The Jordanian dinar is pegged to the USD, with the Central Bank of Jordan committed to maintaining monetary stability.
In line with its Economic Modernisation Vision, Jordan has introduced several reforms to attract foreign investment and promote sustainable development. A key initiative is the Investment Environment Law of 2022, which provides incentives and tax breaks for companies operating in free zones, development zones, and less developed areas. Additionally, the government has established a network of special economic, development, and free zones to position Jordan as a competitive regional hub for trade and exports. Leveraging its strategic location in the Middle East, Jordan offers investors access to key regional and international markets, making it an attractive destination for business expansion.
