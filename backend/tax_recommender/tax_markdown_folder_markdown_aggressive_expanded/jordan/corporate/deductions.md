## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 11 February 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets are determined using the straight-line method, using provisions, procedures, and rates defined by the depreciation regime issued for this purpose.
## Goodwill
Purchased goodwill can be amortised using the straight-line method, using provisions, procedures, and rates defined by the depreciation regime issued for this purpose.
## Start-up expenses
There is no clear provision in the Jordan income tax law to define the treatment of start-up expenses; however, these expenses can be accepted at the establishment year.
## Interest expenses
A 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio would apply in respect of related party debt (e.g. shareholder debt). No restriction should apply on unrelated party financing.
Interest (including capitalised interest) on the related party debt exceeding the 3:1 debt-to-equity ratio would not be deductible for CIT purposes.
For the purposes of the debt-to-equity ratio, equity is the higher of: (i) paid in share capital or (ii) average equity.
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible provided certain conditions are met.
## Charitable contributions
A person may deduct any amount paid during the tax period as a donation to any of the governmental departments, public or official institutions, or municipalities from the gross income in the period in which the payment occurred.
Any person may deduct subscriptions and donations paid in Jordan without any personal benefit for religious, charitable, humanitarian, scientific, environmental, cultural, sport, and professional purposes if the Council of Ministers approves its character. The deductible amount according to the provisions of this paragraph shall not exceed 25% of the taxable income after deducting what is provided for in the first paragraph above and before making this deduction.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not acceptable expenses for income tax purposes.
## Taxes
Taxes and fees paid (non -income tax related) on taxable activities are deductible.
Foreign income tax paid for income earned from sources outside Jordan that was subject to tax under the provisions of the tax law is deductible.
## Other significant items
Approved expenses, including the following, are deductible:
## Net operating losses
Assessed losses incurred after 1 January 2015 may be carried forward up to five years following the date of which these losses are final and audited by the Jordan tax authority . As for the assessed losses incurred before 1 January 2015, such losses may be carried forward indefinitely, taking into consideration that these losses should be used first. The carryback of losses is not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A resident generally may claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, taking into account the transfer pricing regime and the applicable WHT, NC and general sales tax on imported services.
