## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Corporate income tax (CIT) is levied, currently at a 25% rate, on the profits deriving from business activities carried out in Angola by resident entities or non-resident entities with a tax permanent establishment (PE), as defined by Angolan domestic legislation.
Tax residents are taxed on worldwide profits, while PEs are liable to taxation on the profits attributable to the PE, sales in Angola of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind to that sold by the PE, and to any other business activity that is of the same or similar kind to that conducted by the PE.
The Angolan system has two tax regimes: the general regime and the simplified regime. The simplified regime applies to taxpayers subject to CIT who are in the VAT non-taxation regime (entities with business turnover below or equal to 25 million Angolan kwanza (AOA).
The following are excluded from the simplified regime:
Taxpayers who have been included in the simplified taxation regime may apply to join the general regime, if they meet the requirements to be included in it, and must submit their application to the relevant tax office by the end of February of the year to which the CIT relates.
The general regime applies to taxpayers whose revenue is over AOA 25 million for two consecutive or non-consecutive years.
Special tax regimes apply to the oil and gas industry and to the mining industry.
Exemptions from CIT are provided for non-resident shipping and airline operators (as long as reciprocity exists in the foreign jurisdiction).
## Investment Income Tax (IIT)
The IIT is due on interest, dividends, royalties, and other income of a similar nature. In Angola, the IIT Code divides such income into two sections, as follows:
### Section A
Section A includes:
The tax is due at the moment that the income starts to be due or is presumed to be due.
A minimum annual interest rate of 6% is deemed on loan agreements and credit facilities, except if another rate is proven through a written and stamped contract.
### Section B
Section B includes (amongst others):
The concept of royalties includes payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films, or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
### Exemptions
The following income is exempt from IIT:
### IIT rate
The IIT rate is generally 15%, except for certain income, for which the rate is 10% or 5%.
The tax rate is 10% for the following income (amongst others):
The tax rate is 5% for the following income (amongst others):
### Assessment and payment
IIT due on income falling in section A of the IIT Code is, as a general rule, assessed and paid by the beneficiary entity when filing the tax return in January of the year following the taxable events. If the beneficiary is a foreign entity, the obligation to assess and deliver usually falls on the Angolan resident entity that is paying the income.
IIT due on income falling in section B of the IIT Code is, as a general rule, withheld by the paying entity.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local taxes on income in Angola.
