## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
Taxation of individuals in India is primarily based on their residential status in the relevant tax year. The residential status of individuals is determined independently for each tax year and is ascertained on the basis of their physical presence in India during the relevant tax year and past years. *See the [Residence](india/individual/residence.html) section for more information*.
The following types of residential status are envisaged for an individual:
Under Indian tax laws, the scope of taxation differs as per the residential status of an individual:
RNOR and NR individuals are not subject to tax in respect to their income earned and received outside of India.
## Personal income tax rates
### Alternate personal tax regime (APTR)
Effective 1 April 2024, i.e. tax year 2025/26, the tax rates under the ATPR, devoid of any deductions or exemptions, have been revised as follows:
| Taxable income (INR) | | Tax on column 1 (INR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 300,000 | - | 0 |
| 300,000 | 700,000 | - | 5 |
| 700,000 | 1,000,000 | 20,000 | 10 |
| 1,000,000 | 1,200,000 | 50,000 | 15 |
| 1,200,000 | 1,500,000 | 80,000 | 20 |
| 1,500,000 |  | 140,000 | 30 |
Under the APTR, the taxpayer is not eligible to claim certain exemptions/deductions/set-off of losses/carryforward of losses, such as:
Note that this is not an exhaustive list and just an overview of certain deduction/exemptions that are not allowed in the APTR.
The APTR option can be exercised for every financial year (FY) if the taxpayer has no business income. If the taxpayer has business income, the option, once exercised, will be mandatory for all subsequent financial years as well, with only a one-time change being permitted later.
The Revenue Department has clarified that the employer will seek information from each of its employees having salary income regarding their intended tax regime, and each such employee will intimate the same to the employer. Upon intimation, the employer will compute the total income and deduct tax at source thereon according to the option exercised.
If intimation is not made by the employee, it will be presumed that the employee continues to be in the default tax regime and has not exercised the option to opt out of the alternate tax regime.
It is also clarified that the employee can elect to change the option of the tax regime at the time of filing one's India tax return.
### Old tax regime
The slab rates applicable to individuals for tax year 2022/23 are as follows:
| Taxable income (INR) | | Tax on column 1 (INR) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 250,000 | - | 0 |
| 250,000 | 500,000 | - | 5 |
| 500,000 | 1,000,000 | 12,500 | 20 |
| 1,000,000 |  | 112,500 | 30 |
The basic exemption limit for resident individuals who are 60 years of age or more but less than 80 years of age at any time during the tax year is INR 300,000. For resident individuals who are 80 years of age or more, it is INR 500,000.
## Surcharge
In addition to the income tax, a surcharge is to be levied where the total income of individuals exceeds INR 5 million, as follows:
| Taxable income (INR) | Surcharge (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 5 million | 0 |
| Above 5 million but up to 10 million | 10 |
| Above 10 million but up to 20 million | 15 |
| Above 20 million but up to 50 million | 25 |
| Above 50 million | 25 (37 in case old tax regime is opted) |
However, on income arising on account of long-term capital gains, the rate of surcharge would be capped at 15%.
## Health and education cess
Health and education cess at the rate of 4% of the income tax and surcharge (if applicable) will be levied to compute the effective tax rate of individuals.
## Tax rebate
Resident individuals are eligible for a tax rebate of the lower of the income tax or INR 12,500 where the total income does not exceed INR 500,000. However, in case the alternate tax regime is exercised, tax rebate would be the lower of the income tax or INR 25,000 where the total income does not exceed INR 700,000.
## COVID-19 reliefs
## Alternative minimum tax (AMT)
AMT is applicable to all persons, other than a company, having income from a business or profession. AMT means an amount of tax that is computed on the adjusted total income. The taxpayer is liable to pay tax on such income at a rate of 18.5% (plus surcharge and health and education cess) on the adjusted total income. For a person located in an international financial services centre deriving income solely in convertible foreign exchange, one shall be liable to pay tax on such income at the rate of 9% (plus surcharge and health and education cess). AMT paid in a year is eligible to be carried forward for set-off against normal tax liability for 15 years. In case of an individual, Hindu undivided family (HUF), an association of persons, a body of individuals, or an artificial juridical person, AMT is not applicable where the adjusted total income does not exceed INR 2 million.
## Local taxes on income
Profession taxes imposed by certain states on individuals are minimal and deductible while calculating taxable income.
