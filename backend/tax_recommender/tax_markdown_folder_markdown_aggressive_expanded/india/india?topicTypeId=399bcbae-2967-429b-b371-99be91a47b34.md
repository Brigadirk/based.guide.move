## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Goods and services tax (GST)
GST is an indirect tax, which is a transaction-based taxation regime, that has been in effect in India since 1 July 2017.
Multiple indirect taxes (except customs duty) have been subsumed within GST, and there is one single tax applicable on supply of goods and services. However, there are a few products that continue to be outside the ambit of GST, such as petrol, diesel, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), natural gas, alcohol for human consumption, and crude oil.
For smooth GST operation, the government has formed a GST Council, which consists of the State Finance Ministers representing their states. The GST Council provides recommendations to the government on various aspects of GST law, such as rate revisions and amendments in GST rules, issuance of notifications, circulars, etc.
### GST regime
GST is a comprehensive ‘consumption tax’ levied on the supply of all goods and services. Indian GST is a dual model:
In case of intra-state supply of goods and services, CGST+SGST/UTGST would become applicable, and in case of inter-state supply of goods and services, Integrated GST (IGST) would become applicable. IGST is a sum of CGST and SGST/UTGST. The rate of GST varies from 5% to 28% depending upon the category of goods and services being supplied or procured, the general rate of tax being 18% for the majority of supplies. Additionally, some categories of goods/services, such as vehicles, aerated beverages, etc., notified by the government are subject to compensation cess under GST. Apart from the applicable GST rates, the government also imposes cess on certain products, such as sale of cars, soft beverages, etc.
The threshold limit for the purpose of obtaining GST registration is INR 2 million aggregate turnover in a financial year (INR 1 million for some special category states, such as the North-Eastern states). For the purpose of the threshold, aggregate turnover will be computed on a PAN-India basis. For some specific categories of supplies and suppliers, the registration requirement is mandatory.
However, the threshold for obtaining GST registration by a person who is engaged in exclusive intra-state supply of goods is INR 4 million aggregate turnover in a financial year, except in some specified cases.
Also, for some special category states making supply of goods/services (*viz.* Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand), the threshold limit has increased from INR 1 million to INR 2 million. For other special category states, the threshold continues to be INR 1 million.
Similar to previous VAT laws, there is a concept of composition scheme under GST for small traders. Small traders having turnover of INR 10 million have an option to avail a composition scheme. Under the said scheme, GST at a lower rate (1% of the taxable turnover for manufacturers/traders and 5% in case of restaurants) would apply. The option to avail such a scheme restricts the admissibility to avail input credit.
Further, the option to pay tax under a composition scheme has been extended to services, except for the following:
### Import of goods and services
The import of goods under the GST regime will be subject to IGST and compensation cess (if applicable), along with basic custom duty (BCD) and social welfare surcharge (up to 10% levied on the BCD). BCD and social welfare surcharge paid at the time of imports are not available as credit under GST; consequently, they will always be a cost to the importer.
Similar to erstwhile service tax laws, on import of service, service recipient would be liable to pay IGST under reverse charge. Also, there are specified categories of goods and services notified by the government on which GST needs to be paid by the recipient under reverse charge such as legal services, Goods Transport Agency services, etc.
Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) *vide* Notification Nos. 11/2023, 12/2023, and 13/2023, dated 26 September 2023, has exempted the importers from paying IGST on ocean freight in cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) contracts. This is pursuant to the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in the matter of Mohit Minerals.
### Zero-rated supplies/export of goods and services
Export of goods and services are zero rated under GST. Exporters can claim refund of input tax credit (ITC) of inputs/input services used in export of goods/services, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions. To claim the zero rate on exports, there is a requirement to file a bond/Letter of Undertaking (LUT) to the jurisdictional tax authorities at the beginning of each financial year. Alternatively, the exporter can pay tax on output and claim refund for the same.
Also, the supplies to an SEZ for authorised operations have been made zero rated under GST. Unlike the erstwhile indirect tax regime, which involved a lot of paperwork to claim export refund claims, a simplified online process to claim refund of exports has been specified under GST. The taxpayer is required to file a refund application and submit the relevant documents online on the GST portal.
To facilitate trade for smaller exporters, the concept of 'merchant exporter' has been introduced under GST. Accordingly, the merchant exporters will now have to pay nominal GST of 0.1% for procuring goods from domestic suppliers for export, subject to specified conditions.
Some clarifications issued by the government in relation to claiming refunds are as follows:
### Input tax credit (ITC)
As per the ITC provisions stipulated under GST law, a registered taxable person is eligible to claim ITC of such goods and services that are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of business. However, there is a specified list of goods and services mentioned below where credit will not be available under GST:
Having said the above, the ITC of goods and services that are obligatory for an employer to provide to its employees, under any law for the time being in force, is allowed.
Under GST, taxpayers are allowed to take ITC and utilise the same for payment of output tax liability. However, no ITC on account of CGST can be utilised towards payment of SGST/UTGST and *vice versa*. The credit IGST credit needs to be first utilised towards payment of output IGST liability. The IGST credit can be utilised to offset CGST/SGST or UTGST output liability, as the case may be, in any order.
#### Procedure for ITC availment
Also, it is pertinent to note that the credit pool is state-specific (i.e. IGST, CGST, and SGST of one state cannot be used to offset output of IGST, CGST, and SGST liability of another state).
### Compliance
#### Monthly returns
There are three monthly returns for a normal taxpayer under GST:
The government has notified a requirement to file monthly Form GSTR-3B (to be filed by the 20th day of the succeeding month).
Further, filing of Forms GSTR-2 and GSTR-3 continues to be suspended by the government.
The government had proposed to implement a new GST return system. The existing returns Form GSTR 1/GSTR 3B would be revamped in lines with the new format. However, this has currently been kept in abeyance (i.e. the existing system of Forms GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B is to continue).
#### Annual return
There is a requirement to file a GST annual return by 31 December of the succeeding financial year. Also, along with a GST annual return, suppliers whose turnover exceeds INR 50 million in a financial year are required to file a GST Audit Report by 31 December of the succeeding financial year.
### Key updates
#### Compliance related
| Aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year | Number of digits of HSN code |
| --- | --- |
| Below INR 50 million | 4 (not required for B2C invoices) |
| Above INR 50 million | 6 |
Such ineligible credit is to be permanently reversed and reported within Table-4B (1) of Form GSTR-3B.
Till the time of the availment of such input credit within Form GSTR-3B return, such input credit is carried forward with the pool of the total credit.
#### Clarifications
However, post the 52nd Council meeting, the government had stated that transmission of ITC through ISD would gradually be made mandatory. This provision has not been notified as yet.
#### SEZ-related updates
#### Concept of e-invoicing under GST
The government introduced an e-invoicing system under GST laws with effect from 1 October 2021. A summary of the key aspects of the proposed e-invoicing system is briefly explained below.
#### Other GST returns
With effect from 1 October 2018, the government has made tax deducted at source/tax collected at source provisions stipulated under GST laws effective.
Tax deducted at source provisions are applicable on cases specified under section 52 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. The notified taxpayers, like the government, Public Sector Undertakings, etc., are required to deduct 2% tax (1% CGST, 1% SGST, or 2% IGST) on payments made for goods/services to suppliers where payment exceeds INR 0.25 million. The tax so collected would be available as credit to the supplier in its electronic cash register, which can be used for set-off against future tax liabilities.
Tax collected at source provisions are applicable for e-commerce operators. Every e-commerce operator is required to deduct 1% tax (0.5% CGST, 0.5% SGST, or 1% IGST) on net value of supplies provided by suppliers through the e-commerce operator's portal. As per the Notification, for the supplies made through the platform of an e-commerce operator, tax is to be paid by the said e-commerce operator. Further, such transactions are to be reported by the e-commerce operator within their Form GSTR-3B.
The requirement of issuance of the tax deducted at source certificate under GST laws has been relaxed (post acceptance of tax deducted at source by deductee on GST portal, it shall be electronically available on GST portal).
The due date of filing the tax collected at source return (Form GSTR-8) is the 10th day of the next month.
### E-way bills
The e-way bill is an electronic bill that will be required for the movement of goods in case the value of the consignment is above INR 50,000. The movement of goods may be (i) in relation to supply, (ii) for reasons other than supply, or (iii) due to inward supply from unregistered persons.
The e-way bill can be generated from the GSTN portal, and every GST-registered taxpayer is required to comply with the requirement to issue an e-way bill.
With effect from 16 November 2018, new enhancements have been made in the e-way bill system, which involves checking of duplicate e-way bills, complete knock down/semi knock down movement of goods imported/exported, shipping address to be mentioned on e-way bill for goods exported outside India, etc.
A rule was inserted such that a person, including consignor, consignee, transporter, courier agency, or an e-commerce operator, who has not filed their GST returns for two consecutive tax periods will not be allowed to generate an e-way bill.
In cases where the principal supply is purely a supply of service and involving no movement of goods, the e-way bill is not required to be generated.
### Advance rulings for Customs and GST
To enable foreign investors to ascertain their indirect tax liabilities arising from proposed business ventures in India, the Central Government has constituted the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) as a high-level, quasi-judicial body. The functions of the AAR consist of giving advance rulings on a specific set of facts relating to specified matters under Customs and GST.
Advance rulings may be sought by any resident/non-resident investor entering into a joint venture in India in collaboration with another non-resident or resident of India, or by a resident setting up a joint venture in India in collaboration with a non-resident. This facility has also been made available to existing joint ventures in India. The Central Government is also empowered to include any other class or category of persons as eligible for the benefit of an advance ruling. Under the customs law, the Central Government has allowed a ‘resident public limited company’ to be eligible for an advance ruling. Under the erstwhile excise and service tax regime, advance rulings could be given only on a proposed transaction, whereas under GST, advance rulings can be obtained on a proposed transaction as well as a transaction being undertaken by the appellant.
In terms of GST provisions, the following matters/questions specified can be sought before the AAR:
The comprehensive provision for advance rulings is provided under GST to ensure that disputes are minimal. Timelines are also given within which the ruling is to be given by the concerned authority. The aim is to provide certainty to the taxpayer with respect to one's obligations under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and an expeditious ruling, so that the relationship between the taxpayer and administration is smooth and transparent and avoids unnecessary litigation.
### Amnesty scheme under indirect tax
Various states (*viz*. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, etc.) have introduced amnesty schemes for settlement of past VAT dues with waiver (certain percentage) of tax dues, interest, and penalty dues, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions.
Late fees for composition dealers have been reduced to INR 500 through Notification No. 2/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, in case of delayed filing of GSTR-4 from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2022, provided that the taxpayer’s file it on or before 30 June 2023. Further, if the tax payable is nil, then no late fees is required to be paid.
As per Notification No. 2/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, the taxable person whose registration got cancelled on account of non-filing of returns and who had failed to file revocation within the time limit (i.e. 30 days) can now apply for revocation of cancellation up to 30 June 2023 only after furnishing the returns due till effective date of cancellation along with due tax, interest, penalty, and late fee.
Best judgement assessment order shall be deemed to be withdrawn, provided returns along with interest and late fees have been filed up to 30 June 2023.
The late fees for delayed furnishing of the annual return for FY 2017/18 to FY 2021/22 has been reduced through Notification No. 7/2023-Central Tax, dated 31 March 2023, to INR 20,000 (CGST 10,000 + SGST 10,000), provided such return has been furnished up to 30 June 2023.
The time limit for passing order under section 73(10) (i.e. non-fraud cases) has been extended by further three months in each of the FYs 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20, as follows:
The CBIC extended the time limit for availing the benefit of amnesty schemes as stated above, which were notified dated 31 March 2023, till 31 August 2023.
The time limit for filing appeal against demand orders under sections 73 and 74 issued till 31 March 2023 has been extended to 31 January 2024. The extension is subject to making a pre-deposit of 12.5% (as against 10%) of the tax under dispute (with at least an incremental 2.5% to be discharged from the electronic cash ledger).
The government has recently introduced an amnesty scheme through the CGST Act for matters pending under litigation other than fraud, misrepresentation, etc. under section 74 of the CGST Act. Through such amnesty, taxpayers can avail the benefit of resolution of such ongoing or pending matters through making payment of tax liability and availing the benefit of waiver of interest and penalty for the periods of FYs 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20.
## Customs duty
All goods imported into India are subject to customs entry requirements and are subject to customs duty generally on an *ad valorem* basis, except for few items (e.g. edible oils, gold, silver) that are subject to specific tariff rate as notified from time to time.
The customs duty is levied based on the classification as laid down in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which follows the Harmonized System of Nomenclature of the World Customs Organisation (WCO), with certain localisation. The customs duty on entry of goods is levied on transaction value (i.e. price paid or payable in additions as provided under Customs Valuation Rules, which are based on GATT Valuation Code). The value basis for assessment is CIF apart from other additions that may be required as directed by Customs in terms of Customs Valuation Rules. However, related-party transactions are scrutinised closely by Indian Customs for arm’s-length nature of transaction and complete disclosure of value for the purpose of assessment of customs duty.
The customs duty comprises basic customs duty (generally levied at 7.5% or 10%) apart from other duties comprising of:
In addition to these duties, which are dependent on classification, certain goods are subject to anti-dumping, countervailing, and safeguard duty as well. Also, depending upon the economic and trade requirement, the government can change the rate of duties on specified goods/sectors.
Exemption from these duties is extended on certain classifications and/or end use/sectoral promotion, including bilateral/multilateral trade agreements. Some of these exemptions can be conditional and require additional compliances as well. Moreover, exemptions now have a validity of two years from the date of notification.
Exemption from customs duties is also extended to promote exports, including businesses located in Free Trade Zones. However, these are linked to export commitments and other conditions/requirements.
Apart from customs duty, imports into India are subject to compliance with trade policy requirements as notified under Foreign Trade Policy. Largely, goods are freely importable; however, some goods may require pre-approval/licences and compliance with domestic regulations in terms of certifications, approvals, etc.
On the export side, while largely no customs duty is levied except on a few specified items, India, being part of the export control regime, monitors export of potential dual use goods and technology.
The cross-border transaction is done through the online portal of Indian Customs, which also has single window facilitation for other approvals. The customs duty needs to be paid electronically within 24 hours of importation and filing of import entry; otherwise, interest and penalty is payable as well. However, specific Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status holders are eligible for duty deferment benefit, subject to conditions. Apart from this benefit, the AEO status holders are extended certain additional benefits in terms of compliances and procedural relaxations.
Moreover, while the clearances are handled by the Customs Broker, the consequences of any error or mis-declaration lie with the importer. Hence, the Customs Broker arrangement needs to be examined and reviewed periodically *vis-à-vis* compliance status.
While Indian Customs now follows a self-declaration regime with faceless customs assessment system in operation, trade needs to ensure that declarations made at the time of import/export entry are correct and compliant with the applicable laws. Indian Customs has adopted post clearance audits where the trade is audited on these compliances as per internal guidelines or periodic checks.
As a trade facilitation measure, an Advance Ruling mechanism is available under Indian Customs for the trade to seek ruling on specific aspects prior to import, like classification, exemption/duty rates, valuation methodology, and origin compliance.
Non-compliance or evasion of duty through suppression of facts or mis-declaration can trigger investigation by the investigative arm of Indian Customs, which, depending upon the facts, can cover a five-year period and may result in notices for demand and penalties, including personal penalties. Hence, having a robust compliance and record management system is a must, as well as being updated on relevant developments.
## Property taxes
Property tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The rate of tax levied varies from city to city in India and is generally related to the prevailing market prices for property in each locality.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duty is a government tax that is levied on all legal property transactions. Stamp duty is a tax that is paid as evidence for any purchase or sale of a property between two or more parties. Stamp papers, which are bought either in the name of the buyer or seller, are valid for six months, provided the stamp duty is paid without any delay. No document that has not been duly stamped can be introduced as evidence in any court proceedings. Stamp duty is charged at both central and state levels. State level stamp duties vary from state to state, and on the document type. Stamp duty should be paid in full without any delay, failing which, a penalty is levied. Stamp duty has to be paid prior to execution (signature by an individual’s party) of a given document, the next day, or on the day of document execution. Stamp duty is paid by a buyer in most cases. However, both the seller and the buyer have to bear the burden of stamp duty for property exchange cases. Stamp duty rates differ in various states across the country, as stamp duty in India is a state subject. However, the Central Government fixes the stamp duty rates of specific instruments.
## Virtual digital assets (VDAs): Crypto taxation
Finance Act, 2022 has introduced provisions to bring VDAs (including crypto currencies, NFTs, etc) into tax ambit. The gains arising on transfer of VDAs would be taxable at 30% without providing any deduction of expenses other than cost of acquisition. Further, any loss arising on transfer of VDAs is not permitted to be set-off against any other income in the current year or subsequent years.
Tax is to be deducted at 1% payment to a resident on transfer of VDAs with effect from 1 July 2022.
## Buyback of shares
An additional tax is payable on transactions involving buyback of shares by Indian companies from its shareholders. A tax at 20% (plus surcharge at 12% and health and education cess at 4%) is payable by the company on the difference of consideration paid on buyback and the issue price of shares. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has prescribed the methodology for determination of amount received for issue of shares under 12 different situations, being a subject matter of tax on buyback. The buyback consideration received will be tax exempt in the hands of the receiver. No tax credit will be allowed in case of such taxes paid either to the company or to the shareholder.
Finance Act, 2024 has amended the provisions related to taxability of buyback of shares. As per the amended provisions, the buyback proceeds shall be considered as deemed dividend in the hands of shareholders. The cost of acquisition shall be considered as capital loss in the hands of shareholders, which can be adjusted against the capital gains, if any. The amended provisions shall be applicable with effect from 1 October 2024.
## Securities transaction tax (STT)
STT is applicable to transactions involving the purchase/sale of equity shares, derivatives, units of equity-oriented funds through a recognised stock exchange, or the purchase/sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to any mutual fund. The STT leviable in respect of such transactions varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based. Rate of STT varies from 0.001% to 0.125%, depending upon the nature of securities. However, securities transacted by any person on a recognised stock exchange located in an International Financial Services Centre where the consideration for such transaction is paid or payable in foreign currency are not subject to STT.
## Taxability of Partnership/ LLP
A partnership firm and an LLP are taxed as separate legal entities. The share of income of partners from a partnership firm or an LLP is exempt from tax. Partnerships and LLPs are taxed at 31.2% (inclusive of surcharge and health and education cess) if the income is less than INR 10 million and 34.944% (inclusive of surcharge and health and education cess) if the income exceeds INR 10 million. Alternate minimum tax at the rate of 18.5% applies to a partnership/LLP.
The interest payment to partners on capital or current account is allowed as tax-deductible expenditure. However, the maximum interest rate allowable for tax purposes is 12% *per annum*. A working partner can be paid salary, bonus, commission, or remuneration. The maximum permissible deduction in respect of remuneration payable collectively to all working partners is based on the book profit of the firm, at slab rates for different levels of book profit.
Finance Act, 2024 has introduced WHT provisions whereby if a partnership firm is making a payment (salary, remuneration, commission, bonus, or interest) to its partner over and above the prescribed threshold, that partnership firm is required to withhold taxes at the rate of 10%.
