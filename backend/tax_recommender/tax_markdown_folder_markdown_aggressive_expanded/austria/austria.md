# Austria
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Austria, a landlocked country of approximately nine million inhabitants in Central Europe, is bordered by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. Austria is divided into nine federal states, with Vienna as the capital. The official language of Austria is German, and the currency is the euro (EUR).
Austria's economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed, agricultural sector. The Austrian economy has greatly benefited from its strong commercial relations to the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, specifically in the banking and insurance sectors.
