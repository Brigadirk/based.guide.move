## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
## Depreciation
Depreciation is taken on a straight-line basis on the following classes of assets at the annual rates shown.
| Asset | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| Permanent buildings | 4 |
| Semi-permanent buildings | 15 |
| Docks, quays, jetties, sea barriers in ports, pipelines, roads, and railway lines | 10 |
| Aircraft and ships | 15 |
The rate of depreciation allowed is doubled in the case of buildings used for industrial purposes.
The tax law also provides for calculation of depreciation on a net book value basis for the following classes of assets. A 'pooling' concept is permitted, whereby assets subject to the same rate of depreciation may be pooled together for purposes of depreciation.
| Pool | Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| First pool is comprised of tractors, cranes, and other heavy machinery and equipment, including computer software installations, furniture and fixtures, vehicles, computer software, and intellectual property (IP) rights | 33.33 |
| Second pool is comprised of drilling equipment | 10 |
| Third pool is comprised of 'other machinery and equipment' not included above | 15 |
## Goodwill
Goodwill is amortisable for tax purposes, generally over the life assigned for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred before the commencement of business are allowed as a deduction in the first year of commencement of operations (or period).
## Interest expenses
Deduction of expenses incurred for the purpose of earning income is generally allowed. Interest expense is allowed for loans from unrelated parties or on loans from banks. Interest paid to related parties is allowed only to the extent the loan terms are at arm's length and subject to satisfaction of the 2:1 debt-to-equity ratio (*see Thin capitalisation in the [Group taxation](group-taxation.html) section*).
## Bad debts and other contingencies
Amounts charged to the profit and loss account for creating provisions in respect of bad debts, stock obsolescence, warranties, and similar types of contingencies are not tax deductible. Deduction is allowed only at the time of write-off or write back. However, provisions created by licensed banks in respect of bad debts are allowable within the limits approved/required by the Central Bank of Oman.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable donations (in cash or kind) are limited to specified institutions and organisations and are subject to an overall limitation of 5% of gross income.
## Meals, entertainment, officers’ compensation, etc.
All expenses incurred for the generation of gross total income are allowed. There are no specific restrictions on deduction for expenses like meals and entertainment, compensation for officers, and life insurance payments for employees. There are limits on the deductibility of directors' fees.
## Social security payments
Social security contributions paid by employers in respect of employees may also be deducted.
## Pension payments
Contributions to pension funds, domestic and foreign, are deductible, provided the fund is licensed (in Oman or the country where it was established) and complies with certain other specified conditions.
## Illegal payments
Payments of bribes or kickbacks, and other illegal payments, are not deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Civil fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes on income, whether incurred in Oman or elsewhere, are not deductible in arriving at taxable income. A credit may be available for taxes paid in a foreign jurisdiction.
## Other significant items/restrictions on allowable expenses
The tax law has imposed restrictions on the deductibility of certain other expenses. The principal items affected are the following:
## Net operating losses
Carryforward of losses is limited to five years, except in the case of companies that incurred losses during a mandatory tax-exempt period, where the net losses may be carried forward indefinitely for offset against future profits.
Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates normally receive in-depth scrutiny from the tax authorities. Accordingly, proper documentation should be obtained in order to establish that these transactions are made at an arm's-length basis.
