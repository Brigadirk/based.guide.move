# Uganda
## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Uganda, a landlocked country in East Africa, is bordered on the east by Kenya, on the north by South Sudan, on the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the southwest by Rwanda, and on the south by Tanzania and Lake Victoria. The official language of Uganda is English, and its capital is Kampala. The shilling (UGX) is the currency of Uganda.
Uganda gained independence in 1962 and has a democratic republic form of government.
Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular rainfall, small deposits of copper, gold, and other minerals, and has discovered oil. Agriculture is the predominant sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Since 1990, economic reforms have ushered in an era of solid economic growth based on continued investment in infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, lower inflation, better domestic security, and the return of exiled entrepreneurs. Growth continues to be solid, despite variability in the price of coffee, Uganda's principal export.
