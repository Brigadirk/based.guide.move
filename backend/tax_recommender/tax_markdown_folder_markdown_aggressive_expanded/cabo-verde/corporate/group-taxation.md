Last reviewed - 16 February 2025

To be taxed under this regime, the group companies must meet the following conditions:

When the regime comes to an end or when one company ceases to qualify for this regime, the tax losses obtained during the regime cannot be carried forward and deducted against future individual taxable income of the companies. The parent company is responsible for demonstrating that the requirements for the application of the group taxation regime are met.
## Transfer pricing
Taxpayers must keep information and documentation regarding their transfer pricing policies on hand. The following taxpayers must prepare a transfer pricing documentation file:

### Communication of the reporting entity
Any entity that is resident in Cabo Verde, or a PE therein of a non-resident, that is part of a multinational group of companies of which an entity is required to file the CbC Report (as foreseen in the CIT Code) is required to file a statement (through electronic means) in which it identifies itself as the reporting entity, or identifying which entity will report the required information (in the latter case, reference should be made to the country of tax residence).
## Limitation on the tax deductibility of net financing expenses
Net financing expenses are only deductible up to the higher of the following limits:
This provision does not apply to public entities, as per Article 68 §5 of the CIT Code.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The CIT Code contains specific CFC rules. Profits or income obtained by non-resident entities that are clearly subject to a more favourable tax regime are imputed to the resident taxpayers subject to CIT that hold, either direct or indirectly, even if through a representative, fiduciary, or intermediary, at least 25% of their share capital, voting rights, or attribution rights over the income or the assets of those non-resident entities.
