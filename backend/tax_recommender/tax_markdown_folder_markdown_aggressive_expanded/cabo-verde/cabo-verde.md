# Cabo Verde
## Overview
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
The Cabo Verde Islands (Cabo Verde), located off the coast of West Africa, became independent on 5 July 1975. Cabo Verde is a representative democracy, with the capital city of Praia accounting for a quarter of its approximately 500,000 citizens. The languages spoken in Cabo Verde are Portuguese and Crioulo, and the currency is the Cabo Verdean escudo (CVE), which is divided into 100 centavos. Since 1998, an exchange agreement between Cabo Verde and Portugal provides a fixed rate between the euro (EUR) and the Cabo Verde escudo as follows: EUR 1 = CVE 110,265.
While Cabo Verde has few natural resources, it is rapidly becoming established as one of the most exciting new markets for tourism development.
