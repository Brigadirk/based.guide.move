## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
Interest provided to non-residents on bonds issued by Mongolian commercial banks are subject to WHT at 5%. A special 5% rate applies on dividend and interest income of an investor who purchased debt instruments or shares of a local entity (not holding mineral resources, oil exploration, and mining special licences) traded in local and international stock markets.
In other cases, dividends, interest, and royalties paid to resident companies and individuals are all subject to WHT at 10%, while dividends, interest, and royalties paid, and payments made for goods sold and work/services provided (directly or electronically), to non-residents are subject to WHT at a 20% rate.
