## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
There have been multiple additions and amendments to the tax legislation promulgated by Mongolian Parliament as follows:
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
To stimulate economic activity, a series of tax incentives were introduced in 2023 and 2024. These incentives were specifically designed to encourage businesses to:
Commencing on 1 July 2024, a series of modifications were enacted for the securities issued by the government, provinces, capital city, and resident taxpayers that are traded on the primary and secondary domestic stock markets. These changes include the following:
The amount of the CIT credit shall not exceed 1% of the taxable income for the relevant tax year. It is expected that requirements and standards for the development projects, activities, and operations eligible for the CIT credit will be approved and monitored by the responsible ministries.
In connection with the previously mentioned CIT credit introduction, the following expenses shall not be deductible from taxable income:
## Customs tariffs, customs duties, and value-added tax (VAT)
From June 2024, the government is entitled to extend the payment period of customs duties and VAT for up to four years, or to allow partial payments over a four-year period, for imported building materials and equipment used in the following major projects:
## Real estate income tax
## Revision of the Asset Valuation Act
The revision of the Law on Asset Valuation was approved by the Parliament on 17 June 2022, and it is effective from 1 January 2023. This revised legislation incorporates the principle of asset valuation for taxation purposes. In alignment with this objective, the Ministry of Finance is assigned to promulgate the procedural guidelines and standard methodology for the valuation of assets for tax considerations. However, the guidelines have not been issued yet.
## Law on Minerals
On 19 April 2024, a new law pertaining to the National Treasury Fund was introduced. This law brought about amendments to several existing laws, including the Law on Minerals and the CIT Law.
The recent amendments to the Law on Minerals now prohibit any entity, whether acting independently or in conjunction with affiliated parties, from owning more than 34% of the total issued shares in a legal entity that holds a licence for a strategically important deposit. The only exceptions to this rule are legal entities that have signed an Investment Agreement with the Government of Mongolia or state-owned entities.
Furthermore, the amendments to the CIT Law impose a tax rate of 30% if the beneficial owner of a mining licence for a strategically important mineral deposit transfers, either fully or partially, the right to own and use land, as well as exploration and exploitation licences for minerals, radioactive minerals, and oil. Such transfers may occur through the gifting or bequeathing of shares, participation, or voting rights in a legal entity.
