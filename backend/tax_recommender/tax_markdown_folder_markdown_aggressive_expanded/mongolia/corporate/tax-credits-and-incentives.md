The Law on Investment also provides a 'stabilisation certificate' in order to create a more stable tax environment in Mongolia. By obtaining a stabilisation certificate, investors can stabilise applicable rates of the following taxes:
The holder of a stabilisation certificate can stabilise tax rates for a period from 5 to 18 years, depending on amount of investment, industry of investment, and geographic location of investment in Mongolia (*see Stabilisation certificate terms below*). Under the valid period of a stabilisation certificate, investors also have the right to apply effective tax rates provided in general legislation if such rates are more beneficial for investors.
The criteria of issuing a stabilisation certificate are:
An investor who made an investment in tobacco and alcohol related activities cannot benefit from tax stabilisation.
If certain conditions are met, the stabilisation certificate period may be extended by 1.5 times for some projects.

## Free Trade Zones (FTZs)
### Establishing FTZs
Currently, there are three FTZs established at the border towns of Altanbulag, Zamyn-Uud, and Tsagaan Nuur.
FTZs have special regimes in terms of tax, customs, transit, state registration, foreign currency, specialised inspection, and visa and labour regulations. Companies registered in FTZs should commence their operations within a year after their registration; otherwise, their registration will be suspended.
### Tax and customs regime
#### CIT
Businesses that have invested 500,000 United States dollars (USD) or more in the FTZs operating to improve infrastructures, such as energy and heating sources, pipeline networks, clean water supplies, wastewater sewage, auto roads, railways, airports, and basic communication lines, shall receive a CIT discount equal to 50% of their invested capital in the FTZ.
For businesses with more than USD 300,000 invested in building warehouses, loading and unloading facilities, hotels, tourist camps, or manufacturers of export and import-substituted goods in the FTZ shall receive a CIT discount equal to 50% of their invested capital in the FTZ.
Loss-making entities in the FTZs can carry forward their losses reflected on their CIT return up to five years from the time of becoming fully operational to reduce their future tax payable.
Entities using innovated and enhanced technology in their businesses shall be fully exempted from CIT for the first five years from the time of starting operation in the FTZs.
#### VAT
There will be no VAT imposed on goods and services manufactured and sold by registered individuals and businesses in the FTZs.
#### Customs and excise taxes
Goods exported from the FTZs are not subject to taxation.
#### Land payments and property taxes in the FTZ
Individuals and businesses may request a land possession and usage right in the FTZs through either project bid or auction.
Entities operating in trade, tourism, and hotel sectors in the FTZs are fully exempted from land possession and usage right payment for the first five years from commencement of operation. This payment is further reduced up to 50% for the following three years.
Businesses operating to improve infrastructures in the FTZs, such as energy and heating sources, pipeline networks, clean water supplies, wastewater sewage, auto roads, railways, airports, and basic communication lines, will be fully exempted from land payment for the first ten years from start of operation.
Buildings and facilities built and registered in the FTZs are fully exempted from the immovable property tax.
## Foreign tax credit
A provision exists for a foreign tax credit, applicable to taxes remitted to foreign jurisdictions. This credit is limited to the equivalent tax liability that would have been assessed in Mongolia on the same income. Furthermore, upon meeting certain prerequisites, taxes paid in foreign countries that are party to information exchange agreements with Mongolian tax authorities may be eligible for credit. This credit can be applied against tax liabilities in Mongolia, thereby mitigating the potential for double taxation.
