## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Taxation of residents
### Employment income
Salary is defined as income in cash and/or in kind received by resident or non-resident individuals, based on an individual employment agreement, a job relation, secondment agreement, or a special statute provided by the law, and is taxed at a flat tax rate of 10%.
Salary assimilated income includes remuneration paid according to non-competition clauses and taxable benefits as provided by the Romanian tax legislation. Moreover, administrators’ fees received by members of the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Management Council, the Board of Director, and the Supervision Council are treated as income assimilated to salaries.
From a salary income tax perspective, taxpayers include:
Mandatory employee social contributions are deductible for Romanian salary income tax purposes.
For benefits in kind and/or in cash received from third parties based on an employment contract or a contractual relationship between parties, the obligation to compute, withhold, and pay the income tax belongs to:
### Income from pensions
Contributive pensions are taxable at a flat tax rate of 10%, the taxable pension income being set by deducting from the pension income (determined as a result of the application of the contribution principle, regardless of its level) the non-taxable amount of RON 2,000 per month.
For other types of pensions, progressive tax rates (10%, 15%, and 20%) are applicable.
### Income from independent activities
Income from independent activities is taxed at a flat rate of 10% and covers income from the activities of production, trade, supplies of services, and incomes from liberal professions, earned individually and/or in a form of association, including incomes from adjacent activities.
Individuals earning income from independent activities, from one or more sources of income, are also liable to pay the social insurance and health insurance contributions (capped) if their income exceeds the thresholds provided by the law as detailed below.
The individuals deriving income from independent activities are liable to pay social insurance contributions for a chosen amount that cannot be lower than 12 national minimum gross salaries or 24 national minimum gross salaries, depending on the level of income derived. Individuals whose income does not reach this ceiling can still opt to pay social insurance contributions.
Health insurance contributions are also due for income from independent activities, and, for the year 2024, the taxable basis is capped at 60 minimum gross salaries per year.
The following social contributions rates apply during 2024:
The value of the national minimum gross salary for 2024 is RON 3,300/month.
In general, the annual net income is being determined on a real system basis. In order to report the estimated income obtained from independent activities and to pay the estimated income tax and social contributions due on such income, if the case, the individuals have to submit the annual income tax and social contributions return (*Declaratia unica privind impozitul pe venit si contributiile sociale datorate de persoanele fizice*) within 30 days from the start of the activity and to pay the related taxes by 25 May of the following year. The calculation of the tax obligations and their payment is done through the individual’s self-assessment, made based on the information filled in the annual income tax and social contributions return. Additionally, a separate annual return has to be filed by 25 May of the year following the one in which the income was obtained in order to report the actual income obtained. Alternatively, specific categories of income from independent activities are taxed on the basis of a fixed income quota, as communicated yearly by the local tax authorities. The income tax assessed and paid under a fixed income quota is considered as final tax.
The taxable income from freelance activities is assessed based on the bookkeeping ledgers that providers of independent activities are compelled to keep. The taxable income is calculated under the real system as gross income minus deductible expenses.
Certain expenses are non-deductible, as follows: fines, late-payment penalties (other than contractual penalties as per the contractual agreements with the authorities), donations, private scholarships, sponsorship and protocol expenses in excess of the upper limits set by law, 50% of the expenses incurred with company cars that are not used exclusively for business purposes (with certain exceptions), and other expenses exceeding limits provided by current law, as well as the expenses incurred for the personal usage of the taxpayer's family members. The list is not exhaustive.
### Income from independent activities obtained based on sport activity contracts
Individuals deriving income from independent activities obtained based on sport contracts are subject to income tax, social insurance, and health insurance contributions in Romania. The legal entity or other entity that is paying the income and is required to keep accounting records has the obligation to compute, report, withhold, and wire to the tax authorities 10% income tax applied on the taxable income, the income tax being final. Similar obligations apply for social insurance and health insurance contributions for those cases when the estimated annual gross income is at least equal to 12 national minimum gross salaries in the case of social insurance contributions with the applicable cap for each type of contribution. This obligation exists for income derived from a single income payer or for income derived by individuals from multiple income payers, with the condition that from at least one payer the income derived is at least equal to the above-mentioned level; in case of multiple income payers, the taxpayer designates by contract the income payer required to calculate, withhold, and pay the contributions.
Otherwise, *similar to the provisions mentioned above under Income from independent activities*, for social contributions purposes, the annual return has to be filed by the individuals in order to report the income obtained based on sport activities contracts and to assess the social insurance and health insurance contributions due on such income. The payment deadline for the annual social contributions due is represented, *as above*, by the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May of the following year for the previous year).
### Income from intellectual property (IP) rights
Income from IP rights is subject to income tax and social contributions. In case the income from IP rights is paid by a legal entity or other entity required to keep accounting records, the income tax is calculated by applying the 10% rate to the taxable income and is withheld at source. In such case, the payer of the income is required to compute, report, withhold, and pay to the tax authorities the following:
Individuals who derive IP rights income from other payers than those mentioned above and individuals who chose to determine their net income on a real system basis have to calculate, declare, and pay the income tax and the social contributions through the annual return to be filed by 25 May of the year following the one when the income was derived (*similar to the general provisions mentioned above for Income derived from independent activities*).
Retired individuals and individuals who derive salary income or income treated as such are exempt from paying social contributions on income obtained from IP rights.
### Capital gains
Generally, the net capital gain is subject to income tax at the flat rate of 10%. The taxable amount is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price of the shares. In general, broker/transaction fees in connection with the acquisition or sale are tax deductible.
The individual has to report any sale of shares (i.e. capital gain/loss) through the annual return by 25 May of the year following the one in which the sale was performed and pay the related taxes, based on a self-assessment made considering the information reflected in the annual return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May).
By way of exception, income from the transfer of securities (other than investment gold) shall be subject to income tax withholding if the transfer is made by intermediaries defined according to the relevant legislation, investment management companies, self-managed investment companies, managers of alternative investment funds, Romanian tax residents, or non-residents who have a permanent establishment (PE) in Romania that has the capacity of an intermediary carrying out the transfer of securities. Such intermediary entities shall be required to determine the gain and withhold the income tax both for revenues obtained from Romania and for those obtained from abroad.
The income tax to be withheld is determined by the intermediary entities at each transfer by applying an income tax rate of:
The health insurance contribution (10%, capped) is also due in case the capital gain, alone or together with other categories of income derived by the individual during the year, as provided by the Fiscal Code, reaches the annual threshold of 6 minimum gross salaries, but not more than 24 minimum gross salaries. It is the obligation of the individual to declare the health insurance contribution in the annual return and pay it by 25 May of the year the income relates with.
### Income from real estate transactions
Income from the transfer of real estate is taxed at the following tax rates applicable on the transaction value, depending on the period for which the property was owned/held:
No income tax is due for ownership of real estate acquired under special laws, for donation deeds between relatives or in-laws up to the third degree inclusively and between spouses, and in cases of inheritance, provided the procedure is finalised within two years as of the date of death of the author of the inheritance (an income tax of 1% of the value of the corpus is levied if the procedure is not completed within those two years).
Income tax due for transfer of real estate ownership is withheld by the notary public and calculated based on the value declared by the parties within the transaction documents. If the value declared by the parties is lower than the estimated minimum value established by the expert appraisal conducted by the Chamber of Public Notaries, the notary public notifies the Romanian tax authorities on this transaction. The tax is to be remitted by the 25th day of the month following that when the income tax was withheld.
### Dividend income
Dividend income is subject to an 8% income tax rate that is to be withheld by the payer of income. This income is considered for assessing the annual minimum cap based on which the health insurance contribution might be due. For example, individuals receiving, in 2024, income from dividends, which, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, are in a value of at least RON 19,800 (6 x minimum gross salary for 2024), have to submit the annual return and pay the health insurance contribution (10% applied on the aforementioned threshold) and the taxable basis is capped at 24 minimum gross salaries per year.
### Interest income
Interest income is subject to the 10% flat tax rate, withheld by the payer of the income, the tax being final. Similar to income from dividends, health insurance contribution (capped) is due if the annual income, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, is of at least the value mentioned above.
### Rental income
Gross annual rental income, other than lease of land, represents the income earned by the owner for a certain year, as stipulated in the rental agreement concluded between the parties.
Rental income is subject to the 10% tax rate and 20% deductible expenses are allowed for assessing the net rental income to be taxed.
In case of payers of income, legal entities or entities who are required to run a bookkeeping, there is an obligation to withhold the 10% income tax, after deducting the 20% deductible expenses out of the gross rental income.
The withheld tax is final and it is to be paid to the state budget by the payer of income by the 25th day of the month following that in which it was withheld. For all other situations, the individual is required to report one’s annual rental income in one’s annual tax return for income tax purposes.
Health insurance contribution (capped) is due if the annual net rental income, alone or together with other categories of personal income, as provided by the Fiscal Code, exceeds the minimum threshold set by the law (e.g. for 2024, the threshold is of at least 6 minimum gross salaries amounting to RON 19,800). The annual taxable basis for the health insurance contribution is capped at 24 minimum gross salaries amounting to RON 79,200.
Individuals obtaining, during the tax year, income from renting out more than five rooms for touristic purposes, starting the following tax year, will treat the income obtained as income from independent activities, and the taxation rules provided for independent activities have to be considered. The individuals have to report such income and pay the related tax obligations through the annual return to be filed by 25 May.
### Income from prizes
Tax on income from prizes is withheld at source and determined by levying 10% on the amount exceeding RON 600 paid for each prize, the tax withheld as such being considered final.
### Income from gambling
Income tax due on income from gambling activities is withheld at source by the organiser/payer of income of gambling activities, by applying the following income tax rates on each gross income received:
The tax calculated and withheld upon disbursement is final.
For gambling income derived from remote or online gambling, the income tax due, as per the above, is determined and withheld at source with the occasion of each transfer realised from the gambling platform into the individual’s bank account or similar.
Income tax due on income derived from gambling activities specific to casinos, poker clubs, slot-machines, and lottery tickets exceeding RON 66,750 is calculated by applying the earlier mentioned income tax rates and by deducting the amount of RON 11,650 from the resulted amount.
### Other income subject to the 10% flat tax rate
The following types of taxable income are included in this category (the list is not exhaustive):
Generally, the income tax due for income from other sources is calculated, withheld, and paid by the income payer. In certain cases (such as for income from virtual currency transfers), the individuals have to file the annual return by 25 May of the year following the one in which the income was obtained and pay the related taxes, based on a self-assessment made considering the information reflected in the annual return, within the same reporting deadline (i.e. 25 May). The health insurance contribution (10%, capped) is also due in case the income from other sources, alone or together with other categories of income derived by the individual, as provided by the Fiscal Code, reaches the annual threshold of 6 minimum gross salaries.
### **Other taxable income**
Income identified by the Romanian tax authorities, in accordance with the Fiscal Procedural Code, for which the source is not identified is taxable with 16% tax rate applied to the taxable basis, as set by the Romanian tax authorities.
Starting with 1 July 2024, the tax rate for this type of income will be 70%.
### Non-taxable income
In the categories of non-taxable income, among others, the following types of income are included, provided that certain conditions are met:
### Exempt income
The following income is exempt from income tax:
## Taxation of non-resident individuals
Income derived by non-resident individuals from activities performed in Romania and income sourced in Romania is generally subject to 10% tax for individuals who are residents of an EU country or a country that has a DTT in place with Romania, with certain exceptions (exceptions may also apply if the tax rate is reduced or eliminated under an applicable DTT concluded by Romania with the country of residence of the individual).
Withholding tax (WHT) of 10% flat rate for non-resident individuals is currently levied on income such as the following types of income sourced in Romania, assuming such income, as provided by the law, is not derived under transactions that are qualified as having an artificial nature (do not have an economic substance):
For the below-mentioned types of income sourced in Romania, taxation is made based on the same rules as for Romanian tax residents:
Also, as an exception to the above-mentioned flat tax rate of 10%,:
On capital gains from Romania, non-resident individuals are subject to the same tax treatment as resident individuals. To fulfil tax obligations arising in Romania, where the case non-residents may appoint a Romanian fiscal representative or a tax agent.
Income from real estate transactions is taxed at the same specific rates as in the case of residents.
Where non-resident individuals can claim treaty protection, the more favourable rates/provisions under the relevant tax treaty can be applied by Romanian payers of income if the beneficiaries have provided the required tax residency certificate.
