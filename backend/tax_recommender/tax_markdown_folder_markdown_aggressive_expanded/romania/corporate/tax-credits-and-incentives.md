The equipment subject to this incentive cannot be depreciated by using the accelerated method.
Companies can benefit from an additional deduction of 50% of the eligible expenses for their R&D activities. Moreover, accelerated depreciation may be applied for devices and equipment used in the R&D activity.

## Other incentives granted to taxpayers
For justified claims of the taxpayers, the tax authorities may grant incentives for the payment of taxes, such as the rescheduling of tax payments due.
