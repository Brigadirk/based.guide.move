## Sales tax
Sales tax is a single-stage tax imposed on taxable goods manufactured locally by a registered manufacturer, and on taxable goods imported by any person. Sales tax is generally an *ad valorem* tax. Specific rates of sales tax are currently only imposed on certain classes of petroleum (generally, refined petroleum). The *ad valorem* rates are 5% or 10% depending on the class of goods.

Import duties are levied on goods that are subject to import duties and imported into the country. Import duties are generally levied on an *ad valorem* basis but may also be imposed on a specific basis. The *ad valorem* rates of import duties range from 2% to 60%. Raw materials, machinery, essential foodstuffs, and pharmaceutical products are generally non-dutiable or subject to duties at lower rates.
