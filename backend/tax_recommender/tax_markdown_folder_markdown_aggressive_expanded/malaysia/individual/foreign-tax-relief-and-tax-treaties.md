## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A tax resident is entitled to claim foreign tax credits against Malaysian tax. Where a treaty exists, the credit available is the whole of the foreign tax paid or the Malaysian tax levied, whichever is lower. In the absence of a tax treaty, the credit available is restricted to half of the foreign tax paid.
