# Libya
## Overview
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
Libya, a country located in North Africa, is bordered by Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, Algeria and Tunisia to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Libya gained its independence in 1951. Libya's capital is Tripoli, and its official language is Arabic (although many Libyans also speak English or Italian as a second language). Libya's currency is the Libyan dinar (LYD).
The momentous events of 2011, which resulted in the overthrow of a regime that had been in place for 42 years, has descended into political uncertainty giving rise to security issues. The oil sector, where production is significantly below pre-2011 levels, remains key to a more stable and peaceful future.
