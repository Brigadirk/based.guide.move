## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is generally a calendar year, although assessments can be made on the basis of a company's own year-end, provided permission is granted in advance from the Tax Department and the company then adheres consistently to the same date.
## Tax returns
All corporate entities must make an annual filing within four months of its year-end or within one month of its audit report, whichever is earlier.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable on a quarterly basis (10 March, 10 June, 10 September, and 10 December) normally commencing the first quarter date after an assessment has been issued.
### Late payment penalties
A late payment penalty is assessed on the tax due at the rate of 1% to a maximum of 12%. In addition, the remaining quarterly payments are due immediately for failing to make an instalment on time.
The law also imposes the following penalties:
## Tax audit process
Tax audits typically occur every three or four years.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for CIT purposes is 15 years.
The tax authorities’ focus during audits continues to be on confirming revenue, ensuring major services providers contracts are tax registered, and seeking additional undeclared salaries and benefits.
