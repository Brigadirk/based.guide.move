The submission of the monthly declared payroll is effectively a self-assessment process.

The due date for PIT is 60 days (plus 15 days grace period) after the month end.
### Late payment penalties
A late payment penalty is assessed on the PIT due at the rate of 1% per month.

Part of the focus of the Tax Department is additional undeclared payroll benefits.
