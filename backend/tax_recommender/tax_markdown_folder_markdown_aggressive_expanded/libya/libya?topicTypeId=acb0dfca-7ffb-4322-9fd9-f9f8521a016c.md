## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
No specific rules apply on income determination for the following categories:
The Income Tax Law allows entities to account on an accrual basis or on a cash basis.
## Inventory valuation
The Commercial Code allows inventory to be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
## Capital gains
Any chargeable gains on the sale of capital assets are taxed as ordinary income. For entities assessed on a deemed profit basis, capital gains should be added to the deemed taxable income.
## Dividend income
Historically, dividend income has not been subject to any additional taxes.
### Inter-company dividends
Libyan taxation laws do not contain any special provisions regarding inter-company dividends.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are not specifically dealt with in Libyan taxation laws. The current practice is for dividend distributions not to be taxed.
