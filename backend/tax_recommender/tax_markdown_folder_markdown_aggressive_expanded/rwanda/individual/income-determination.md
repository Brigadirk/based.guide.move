## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Employment income
Employment income includes all payments made to the employee in cash or in kind. This includes the following:
Benefits in kind form part of taxable remuneration. The Rwandan law provides the basis for taxation of the following benefits in kind:
There is no relief for pension contribution as contribution is based on the amount after payment of PIT. The withdrawal is therefore not taxed.
### Equity compensation
There is no specific law on taxation of stock options. In practice, stock options acquired by virtue of employment, whether from the employer or an associated institution, are subject to income tax on the difference between the market value of the equity instrument and the consideration paid by the employee or office holder on the date that the equity instruments vest.
## Business income
Self-employment income is derived from an unincorporated business, partnership, trade, or profession.
An amount received or accrued from self-employment will be taxable in Rwanda. Non-residents will only be taxed on Rwandan-sourced self-employment income.
## Capital gains
## Dividend income
Dividends declared by Rwandan resident companies are generally subject to a 15% withholding tax (WHT) for individual shareholders, which is the final tax.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to WHT at a rate of 15%, which is the final tax.
## Rental income
Rental income tax is charged on income generated by individuals from a rented immovable property located in Rwanda.
Rental income tax is charged to the following:
The taxable income shall be obtained by deducting from the gross rental income 50%, considered as the expenses incurred by the taxpayer on maintenance and upkeep of the rented property.
When the taxpayer produces the proof of bank interest payments on a loan for the construction or purchase of a rented property, the taxable income is determined by deducting from gross rental income 50%, considered as the expenses incurred plus actual bank interest paid from the beginning of the rental period.
The rental income tax is calculated as follows:
