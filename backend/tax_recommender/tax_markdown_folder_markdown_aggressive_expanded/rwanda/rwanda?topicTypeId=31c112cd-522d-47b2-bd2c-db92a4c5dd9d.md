## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Taxable period
The tax period for individuals is January to December of each year.
## Tax returns
Annual tax returns/declarations for individuals are due by 31 March of the following year after the tax period. However, the following individuals are exempted from filing of annual tax returns:
## Payment of tax
Tax on employment income is withheld by the employer under the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system and remitted to the RRA on a monthly basis together with PAYE returns by the 15th day of the following month.
## Tax audit process
There is no specified audit cycle, but individuals can be selected for an audit by any factor by the RRA. The audit or inspection will commence with a request from the RRA for the taxpayer to make available any such records or information as may be required.
## Statute of limitations
Submitted tax returns remain open for audit for a period of five years, and a taxpayer has an obligation to keep all financial records for a period of ten years.
High net worth individuals and sole proprietorships are the focus of the RRA.
