## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied on the supply of taxable goods and services, including online services, in Rwanda as well as on the importation of taxable goods and services into Rwanda.
The threshold for VAT registration is taxable turnover of RWF 20 million in any relevant year or RWF 5 million in a calendar quarter.
The standard VAT rate is 18% and applies to goods and services that are neither exempt from VAT nor zero-rated.
Services supplied are taxable if:
Exports of goods and services are subject to VAT at 0%. Supplies to privileged persons, such as goods imported for official purposes of diplomatic missions, supplies made under special arrangements between the government of Rwanda and donors, and supplies or importation made under special technical aid agreements, are subject to VAT at 0%. Persons entitled to zero rating of goods or supplies received by them are required to pay VAT at the time of receiving the supply and then apply for a refund of the VAT paid or rather engage a revenue authority so they can affix a signature and a stamp on the VAT invoices so that the VAT is not paid on such invoices.
Suppliers who provide zero-rated services or goods are entitled to recover input VAT incurred in making the supply. This is unlike exempt supplies, where input VAT recovery is not allowed. Therefore, zero rating is preferable to exemption.
The VAT returns and relevant payment are due to the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month. However, for taxpayers whose annual turnover is equal to or less than RWF 200 million, the VAT declaration is done quarterly and the payment of the tax due is within 15 days after the end of the quarter. Voluntary VAT declaration on a monthly basis is, however, still admissible for taxpayers in this bracket.
## Customs duties
Rwanda is a member of the East African Community (EAC), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Common External Tariffs (CET) levied by all those economic blocks where Rwanda is part of are generally as follows:
Goods will only enjoy the preferential community tariffs if they meet the EAC Customs Union Rules of Origin.
Certain industries and items are also entitled to exemptions under the customs law (e.g. certain hotel equipment, solar equipment, computer software, and electric vehicles, spare parts, batteries, and charging station equipment).
Enterprises established in Free Trade Zones are exempt from customs duty on imports for exported products. There also exists an import duty remission scheme, where import duty may be waived for raw materials used to manufacture goods for export. This is subject to a requirement for proof of export and execution of the bond.
All imported goods, except those listed as exempt, are also subject to the 1.5% Infrastructure Development Levy (IDL) and the 0.2% African Union Levy (AUL). Additionally, imported goods, regardless of whether they are exempted, are subject to a 0.2% Quality Inspection Fee (QIF). The levies are computed on the customs value of imported goods.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is imposed on the manufacturing or importation of certain commodities, mainly soft drinks, bottled water, cigarettes, alcohol, fuels, and lubricants.
The following rates apply in respect of products and services for which excise duty is applied:
The following goods are exempt from excise duty:
## Immovable property tax
The immovable property tax is assessed and paid by the owner, the usufructuary, or any other person considered to be the owner. The immovable property tax is levied on the market value of a building and surface of a plot of land.
If the immovable property consists of a plot of land that is not built, the tax on immovable property is calculated on each square metre of the whole surface of the plot of land. Where the immovable property consists of a plot of land, a building, and its improvements, the tax on immovable property for a plot of land is calculated separately on each square metre, while the tax on the building and its improvements is based on the market value.
The tax rate on buildings is determined as follows:
The tax rate on plots of land varies between RWF 0 and RWF 80 per square metre. Any undeveloped plot of land is subject to additional tax of 100% of what is arrived at using the rates per square metre.
For the first assessment cycle of five years, declaration of immovable property tax is made to the tax administration not later than 31 December of the first tax period. A new declaration of immovable property tax for the second assessment cycle and going forward will be filed not later than 31 December of the last year of each tax assessment cycle.
## Transfer taxes
The sale of immovable property that is for commercial use results in immovable property tax at the rate of 2% where the seller is a registered taxpayer or at the rate of 2.5% where the seller is an unregistered taxpayer. This tax is on the amount in excess of the first RWF 5 million of the selling price.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp duties in Rwanda.
## Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT is charged on the direct or indirect sale or transfer of shares. The CGT is charged at the rate of 5% of the capital gain. The capital gain on sale or transfer of shares is determined as the difference between the acquisition value of the shares and their selling or transfer price.
CGT is required to be collected and remitted to the revenue authority by the company in which the share sale or share transfer transaction occurred.
CGT is required to be declared and paid within 15 days following the month in which the sale or transfer of shares occurred.
However, the following transactions are exempted from capital gains tax:
Corporate restructuring is defined to include the following:
Note that capital gains arising from the sale of commercial immovable property are subject to tax at the rate of 30%.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to withhold tax on payments to employees in respect of employment services that they have rendered. The tax is withheld through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system. The tax deducted should be remitted to the RRA by the 15th day of the following month.
## Social security contributions
All people working in Rwanda, both nationals and foreigners, are required to contribute to a national social security contribution fund managed by the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB). The rate of contribution under the mandatory pension scheme is fixed at 12% of the employee's gross salary. The employer and the employee are each required to contribute 6% of the employee’s gross salary to the scheme..
Gross salary means total remuneration received by the employee, including allowances, bonuses, commissions, transport allowances and all other cash benefits, as well as any fringe benefits, but excludes reimbursement of business expenses and transport benefit in kind.
The social security contributions computed are required to be remitted to the RRA by the 15th day of the following month.
### Maternity leave benefits scheme
The law governing maternity leave benefits requires all employers and employees to contribute towards a maternity fund, which is administered by the RSSB.
The law grants employed women full monthly salary for the entire 12 weeks duration of maternity leave. The main requirements affecting employers are summarised below:
### Community Based Health Insurance Scheme (CBHIS) contribution
The law governing the CBHIS contributions requires all employees to contribute towards the CBHIS fund, which is administered by the RSSB.
The main requirements are summarised below:
## Trading licence fee
Districts charge a trading licence fee, which is paid by any person who commences a profit-oriented activity in Rwanda. The tax year starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December, and the trading licence fee must be paid for a whole year. If such activity starts after January, the taxpayer must pay a trading licence fee equivalent to the remaining months, including the one in which the activities started.
The tax declaration is made not later than 31 January of the year that corresponds to the tax period. The trading licence fee is calculated on the basis of turnover, and the amount of the fee varies between RWF 100,000 (for turnover of more than RWF 2 million) and RWF 2 million (for turnover of over RWF 50 billion).
The turnover applied is as per the amount approved in the previous year by the RRA. Every year, not later than 31 January, the RRA submits the necessary data to the concerned decentralised entity.
There are also different trading licence fee rates for other small traders. These include profit-oriented activities that are not registered on income tax that are in urban and rural zones, transporters of people and goods on vehicles, boats, and motorcycles.
