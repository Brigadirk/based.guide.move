## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
## Reorganisations
Most corporate reorganisations (e.g. mergers, de-mergers, transfer of business assets within a group of companies, vertical and horizontal spin-off of business or part of business, share-for-share transactions and cross-border reorganisations where the Swiss tax residency and Swiss taxation of assets is maintained, and like-kind exchange of participations) are typically possible without triggering adverse Swiss tax consequences (tax neutrality is available). In addition, special rules provide for a legal framework to tax neutrally substitute assets and qualifying shareholdings. For reorganisations, it is best practice to apply for advance tax rulings with the competent tax authorities. Advance tax rulings covering certain cross-border reorganisation aspects may be subject to the spontaneous exchange of information (*see Spontaneous exchange of information below*).
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
In 2013, Switzerland and the United States (US) signed a bilateral FATCA agreement. The FATCA agreement will help Swiss financial institutions by means of simplifications in the implementation of the US FATCA legislation. The FATCA agreement and the implementing Swiss act entered into force on 2 June 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.
The FATCA agreement shall ensure that accounts held by US persons with Swiss financial institutions are disclosed to the US tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or through ordinary administrative assistance channels (no automatic information exchange).
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Based on the results of the BEPS project, Switzerland has launched several actions in order to implement BEPS measures into the Swiss tax law, in particular:
The implementation of further BEPS actions into the Swiss tax law and DTTs is an ongoing process.
## Automatic information exchange
In view of the OECD’s developments on a new standard for the automatic exchange of information, Switzerland switched to an automatic exchange of information between the competent authorities on a reciprocal basis.
Switzerland has agreed on the automatic exchange of information in respective agreements with numerous partner states (e.g. the EU member states, many offshore countries, as well as most of the OECD member states).
## Spontaneous exchange of information
The ordinance on international administrative assistance in tax matters (StAhiV) contains rules on the spontaneous exchange of information. A spontaneous exchange of information is an unrequested exchange of information available to the competent Swiss tax authorities that may be of interest to the competent foreign tax authority.
The spontaneous exchange of information covers the following advance tax rulings:
The relevant information regarding such advance tax rulings shall be spontaneously exchanged with the competent foreign tax authorities within three months after the receipt of the information by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
