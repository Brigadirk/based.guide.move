## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Guatemala taxes its citizens and resident or non-resident individuals on their compensation attributable to services rendered in Guatemala and on other Guatemalan-source income.
Income taxes for individuals are generated by any remuneration or income in cash, whatever its denomination might be, from personal labour provided in a dependence relationship by individuals residing in the country. Income taxed under this regime shall be imputed to the period when collected by the payee or is available.
## Personal income tax rates
The progressive tax rates are as follows:
| Taxable income (GTQ\*) | | Tax on column 1 (GTQ) | Tax on excess (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Over (column 1) | Not over |
| 0 | 300,000 | 0 | 5 |
| 300,000 |  | 15,000 | 7 |
