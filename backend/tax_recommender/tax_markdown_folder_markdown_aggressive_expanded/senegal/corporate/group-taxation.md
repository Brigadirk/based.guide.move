## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Senegal.
## Transfer pricing
Companies with an annual turnover or amount of gross assets of at least XOF 5 billion are required to make available documentation upon a tax audit. This applies when the company directly or indirectly owns more than 50% of the share capital or more than 50% of the voting rights in another company.
An annual transfer pricing tax return shall also be provided with CIT filing (by April 30). This is a kind of simplified transfer pricing documentation, which includes information such as the description of the related companies and activities performed, group transfer pricing policy, intra-group flows, etc.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Companies with group revenues exceeding XOF 492 billion must file a CbC report showing the allocation of revenues, profits, and taxes paid. The company shall prepare consolidated financial statements, and own directly or indirectly one or more legal entities located in Senegal.

Automatic exchange of the CbC report will take place between the Senegalese tax administration and other tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which the group operates and which have concluded a tax treaty providing such exchange with Senegal.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific rules regarding thin capitalisation in Senegal. Nonetheless, the following tax and legal rules should be known:
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions in Senegal for CFCs.
