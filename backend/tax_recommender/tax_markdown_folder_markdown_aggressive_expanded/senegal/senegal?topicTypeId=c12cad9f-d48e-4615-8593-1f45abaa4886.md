## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Branches and companies are liable for corporate income tax (CIT) at the rate of 30%.
Residents are taxed upon their worldwide income. Non-residents are generally taxed via the existence of a permanent establishment (PE) on Senegal-source income.
Withholding taxes (WHTs) may also apply to non-residents, as per the services delivered to Senegalese taxpayers, subject to the application of a double tax treaty (DTT).
## Minimum CIT
A minimum CIT is due, in case of lack of profits, at the rate of 0.5% applied on the annual turnover. The maximum amount cannot be more than XOF 5 million.
## Local income taxes
