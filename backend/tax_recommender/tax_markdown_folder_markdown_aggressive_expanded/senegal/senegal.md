# Senegal
## Overview
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Senegal, located in Western Africa, is bordered by Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Senegal is divided into 14 regions, each administered by a regional council, with Dakar as its capital. The official language of Senegal is French, and the currency is the *Communauté financière d'Afrique* (Financial Community of Africa or CFA) franc (XOF).
Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation. As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal is working towards greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. Senegal is also a member of the Organisation for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).
The main industries of Senegal include food processing, mining, cement, artificial fertiliser, chemicals, textiles, refining imported petroleum, and tourism.
