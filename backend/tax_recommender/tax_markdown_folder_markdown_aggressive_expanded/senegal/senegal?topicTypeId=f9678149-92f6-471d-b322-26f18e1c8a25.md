## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are borne exclusively by the employer.
The rate for the industrial accident/occupational disease branch has to be confirmed by the authority when registering the entity with the Social Security Office (applicable rate to be stated within the related certificate).
| Sector | Rate of contributions (only payable by employers) (%) | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Family | 7 | 63,000 |
| Industrial accident / Occupational disease | 1/3/5 | 63,000 |
### Retirement contributions
Retirement contributions are payable both by the employer and the employees:
| Regime | Rates of contributions (%) | | Maximum monthly basis of calculation (XOF) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payable by employers | Payable by employees (withheld on the salary) |
| General | 8.4 | 5.6 | 432,000 |
| Executive | 3.6 | 2.4 | 1,296,000 |
### Employment medical coverage
The employer shall subscribe for all employees a medical coverage. The level of coverage depends on the type of agreement concluded with the dedicated organism. Usually, the employee is reimbursed for 80% of medical expenses, even though the law provides a range between 50% and 80%.
The monthly rate is 6% to be levied on a contribution rate between XOF 60,000 and XOF 250,000, for both the employee and the employer.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Subject to certain exclusions, most commercial operations are subject to an 18% VAT.
VAT on tourism activities is 10%.
A 17% special tax on financial activities (mainly banking, money transfers, interest, premiums and other remunerations received on loans, keeping of bank accounts or equivalent, financial intermediation, and change operations) is applicable instead of VAT.
VAT returns must be filed monthly.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Senegal.
