# Czech Republic
## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Based on Czech domestic tax legislation, when eliminating double taxation of income from abroad, the provisions of DTTs concluded by the Czech Republic are to be followed. Alternatively, in some cases, income from abroad can be exempt from taxation in the Czech Republic based on the local Czech legislation. If no applicable treaty exists, the income can be reduced by the tax paid on the income abroad.
