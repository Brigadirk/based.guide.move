## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Income-related expenses are normally deductible.
Compulsory Luxembourg and foreign legal social security contributions covered by a social security treaty are also tax deductible.
Employee’s contributions to a qualifying employer-provided pension scheme are tax deductible up to a limit of EUR 1,200 per year.
## Personal deductions
Non-residents can deduct only expenses related to income subject to Luxembourg taxation.
Residents may deduct extraordinary charges for sickness, accidents, living costs of parents, and so on, to the extent that they exceed a certain percentage of their taxable remuneration.
In addition to the following, specific deductions are also available, notably for kindergarten costs and domestic help.
### Insurance premiums and interest expenses
For residents, certain premiums paid for life, sickness, accident, disability, and third-party liability insurance, as well as interest arising on personal loans (contracted to purchase a car, furniture, and so forth), are deductible, up to EUR 672 increased by the same amount for jointly taxable spouses/civil partners and each dependent child. This allowance is increased for a one-time premium for death insurance subscribed to assure the reimbursement of a loan taken out for the purchase of a house. The related tax deduction varies with the age of the taxpayer.
Under specific conditions, insurance premiums paid within the context of a private pension scheme qualifying under Luxembourg tax law are also tax deductible up to EUR 3,200. The deduction applies to each spouse/civil partner, provided both are covered by a private pension insurance contract.
## Standard deductions
A minimum standard deduction of EUR 480 is granted for the above expenses; it is doubled if the spouse/civil partner is also employed.
A minimum lump-sum allowance of EUR 25 is deductible from income from capital and investments subject to progressive tax rates. The minimum lump-sum allowance is doubled in the case of collectively taxed spouses/civil partners if both earn income from capital and investments. Actual expenses exceeding this lump-sum allowance can be deducted.
## Personal allowances
Jointly taxable spouses/civil partners who both exercise a professional activity taxable in Luxembourg benefit from a lump-sum allowance of EUR 4,500.
## Non-resident taxpayers
Non-resident employees may deduct compulsory social security contributions, contributions to an employer-provided supplementary pension scheme, and school and education expenses paid for a child who does not form part of the taxpayer's household, as well as the standard deduction of EUR 480.
In addition, if at least 90% of the personal worldwide income derived by a non-resident (or 50% of the professional income of the household for Belgium resident) is taxable in Luxembourg, the taxpayer may opt to be treated as a resident for tax purposes, thus benefiting from the same deductions and allowances as a resident. The tax rate applied to Luxembourg-source income is then determined on the basis of the taxpayer’s households total worldwide income.
## Extraordinary expenses
Extraordinary charges are tax-deductible only if they exceed the 'normal charge' of the household as determined by Luxembourg tax law. The costs incurred should be unpredictable, unforeseeable, and reduce the ability to pay income tax during the year (e.g. medical expenses not reimbursed by the CNS or a mutual fund, legal fees, etc.).
Two methods of calculation:
## Losses
Capital losses can be offset only against capital gains in the same year (only short terms).
