## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Luxembourg taxes its corporate residents on their worldwide income and non-residents only on Luxembourg-source income.
Until tax year 2024 (included), businesses with taxable income lower than EUR 175,000 are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at a rate of 15%. Businesses with taxable income between EUR 175,000 and EUR 200,001 are subject to CIT computed as follows: EUR 26,250 plus 31% of the tax base above EUR 175,000. The CIT rate is 17% for companies with taxable income in excess of EUR 200,000 leading to an overall tax rate of 24.94% in Luxembourg City (taking into account the solidarity surtax of 7% on the CIT rate and including the applicable 6.75% municipal business tax rate).
As from tax year 2025, business with taxable income lower than EUR 175,000 are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) at a rate of 14 %. Businesses with taxable income between EUR 175,000 and EUR 200,001 are subject to CIT computed as follows: EUR 24,500 plus 30 % of the tax base above EUR 175,000. The CIT rate is 16 % for companies with taxable income in excess of EUR 200,000 leading to an overall tax rate of 23,87 % in Luxembourg City (taking into account the solidarity surtax of 7 % on the CIT rate and including the applicable 6.75 % municipal business tax rate).
The CIT does not apply to tax-transparent entities (e.g. general or limited partnerships or European Economic Interest Groupings) unless they are subject to the reverse-hybrid rules.
## Solidarity surtax
A 7% solidarity surtax is imposed on the CIT amount.
As from tax year 2025, taking into account the solidarity surtax, the aggregate CIT rate is 17.12% for companies with taxable income in excess of EUR 200,000.
## Municipal business tax on income
Municipal business tax is levied by the communes and varies from municipality to municipality. The municipal business tax for Luxembourg City is 6.75%.
As from tax year 2025, the effective combined CIT rate (i.e. CIT, solidarity surtax, and municipal business tax) for Luxembourg City is 23.87%.
