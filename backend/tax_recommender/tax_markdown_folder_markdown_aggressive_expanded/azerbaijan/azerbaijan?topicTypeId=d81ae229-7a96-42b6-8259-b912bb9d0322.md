Banks and the national operator of the postal service must deduct 10% WHT from funds transferred by residents to digital wallets, which refer to software to carry out electronic payments.
Moreover, local banks, branches of a foreign banks in the Republic of Azerbaijan, or national postal operators shall be required to withhold tax at the source of payment when individuals who are not registered with the tax authority are making payments to countries or territories subject to preferential taxation.
