## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
All expenses connected with generating income, except for non-deductible expenses and expenses with limited deductibility, specifically defined by the law, are deductible from income.
## Depreciation
Depreciation using the reducing balance method can be calculated up to the following annual rates:
## Goodwill
Azerbaijani tax legislation does not specify the definition of goodwill.
## Tax basis of assets
The tax basis of assets includes expenses for their acquisition, production, construction, assembly, and installation, as well as other expenses that increase their value, with the exception of expenses for which the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction.
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans received from overseas and/or from related parties may be deducted, limited to the interest rate on loans with similar currency and maturity at the interbank credit auction. In absence of such an auction, deductions for interest may not exceed rates of 125% of the interbank auction credit rates published by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan.
Beginning from 1 January 2019, thin capitalisation rules were introduced. Accrual interests on foreign borrowings exceeding two times equity will not be deductible for profit tax purposes (note that it is not applicable to banks and credit institutions).
## Bad debt
A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deduction for doubtful debts connected with goods, work, and services that have been realised where income from them was previously included in the gross income received from entrepreneurial activity. Doubtful debt deduction shall be allowed only if the debt is written off as worthless in the taxpayer’s books.
## Charitable contributions
Beginning from 1 January 2021, contributions not exceeding 10% of the profit of the reporting year, transferred to the funds created for public and social purposes, shall be exempt from tax for a period of eight years.
## Fines and penalties
No deduction is allowed for financial sanctions or interest calculated for delayed payment of taxes.
## Taxes
Property, land, and mining taxes are deductible.
## Other expenses deductible within certain limits
## Non-deductible expenses
The following expenses are non-deductible:
## Net operating losses
Taxable losses incurred by legal entities may be carried forward for five years to offset future taxable profit, without limitations. Carryback of losses is not possible.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Under the Tax Code, the transactions between related parties should comply with:
The Azerbaijan transfer pricing legislation requires that cross-border 'controlled' transactions between related parties be carried out at arm’s-length prices. In case transfer prices are not set at arm’s length, the Azerbaijani tax authorities have the right to adjust the taxpayers’ revenues and expenses so as to reflect the market value.
The substance of the market price is very similar to the transfer pricing.
