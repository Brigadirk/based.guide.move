### Simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities
Under the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities, taxes are paid on a monthly basis.
## Tax returns
### System on earnings from lucrative activities
Under the system on earnings from lucrative activities, returns are due after the end of the fiscal period (31 December) but no later than 31 March of each year.
The income tax return shall be accompanied by the documents required by the regulations, which might include a:
  * balance sheet 
  * statement of results of operations 
  * statement of cash flows, and 
  * statement of cost of production. 


Documents must be duly certified by a professional or an independent accounting firm. The financial statements that accompany the return shall agree with both those recorded in the financial statements ledger and those destined for publication.
Both the income tax return and exhibits thereto shall be signed by the taxpayers, their agent, or their legal representative or by any other responsible persons so determined by this law and the Tax Code.
### Simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities
Under the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities, there is an obligation to file an annual informative tax return, which is due on 31 March of each year.
## Payment of tax
### System on earnings from lucrative activities
Under the system on earnings from lucrative activities, taxpayers are required to prepay their estimated annual income tax liability in quarterly instalments. The balance is due upon filing the return.
Taxpayers may choose one of the following procedures for computing estimated quarterly tax liability:
  * Tax on income shown by partial closure of accounts or computation of presumed liquidation of operations at the end of each quarter. 
  * Tax on 5% of overall gross income earned during the corresponding quarter of the preceding year (5% of the 30% income tax rate equals 1.5%). 
  * Tax equivalent to one-fourth of the tax paid for the immediately preceding tax year. 


### Simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities
Under the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities, tax is payable via flat tax withholdings (the tax is to be retained by either the customer or the recipient of services) or by direct remittances to the tax office made monthly within the first ten working days of the month following the invoice date.
Taxes on income are governed by the income tax law, _Ley de Actualización Tributaria_ , and its related regulations. Administration of the law is vested with the SAT.
Taxpayers registered before the tax administration under this system will settle and pay the tax through the withholding system. Persons or entities obligated to withhold are those taxpayers who pay or credit into account for the acquisition of goods and services to the taxpayers registered under this system.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities can request specific information at any moment. If necessary, a tax audit can be carried out. The tax authorities must formally notify the taxpayer of any specific adjustments, and the taxpayer has 30 working days to file a response. After filing the response, the taxpayer will again be notified by the tax authorities if the adjustments are confirmed or overturned.
## Statute of limitations
The right of the tax administration to checks, adjustments, corrections, or determinations of tax liabilities; settle and enforce interest and penalties; and enforce payment of taxpayers must be brought within four years. In the same period, taxpayers must exercise their right of recourse for overpaid or unduly charged taxes, interest, penalties, and fines.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities normally focus on the following:
  * Deductible expenses. 
  * VAT credits. 
  * WHT. 
  * Capital gains.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Taxpayers under the system on earnings from lucrative activities may deduct costs and expenses from gross income, including the following.
## Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated annually using the straight-line method. The tax authority may authorise a different method on request of the taxpayer. The annual maximum rates allowed as deductible expenses are the following:
Asset | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Building and improvements | 5  
Machinery and equipment | 20  
Furniture and fixtures | 20  
Vehicles | 20  
Tools | 25  
Tree and vegetable species | 15  
Computer equipment | 33.33  
Any other depreciable asset | 10  
## Intangible assets
Intangible assets (e.g. goodwill, trademarks, manufacturing processes, patents, software, know-how) may be deductible under the straight-line method of amortisation over a period that depends on the conditions of the acquisition or creation of the intangible asset concerned, and cannot be less than five years. Goodwill actually paid can be amortised over a period of a minimum of ten years.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are deductible.
## Interest expense
The deduction of interest expense may not exceed the result of multiplying the interest rate by three times the average net total assets reported by the taxpayer in the corresponding annual tax return.
## Uncollectible accounts
Uncollectible accounts arising in normal business operations can be deducted individually or, alternatively, via an allowance for doubtful accounts, which shall not exceed 3% of the debit balances of accounts and notes receivable.
## Charitable contributions
Duly proven donations made to the government, the municipalities, and their agencies, as well as to duly authorised not-for-profit welfare, social service, and scientific associations and foundations, universities, political parties, and guild entities, are deductible. The maximum deductible amount for income tax purposes of each period shall not exceed 5% of the donor’s net income, up to a maximum of GTQ 500,000 per year.
## Employee pension/retirement funds
The deduction of provisions to establish or increase employee pension and retirement funds or reserves is allowed, provided the government approves the related plans.
## Severance compensation payments
Severance compensation payments are allowed as deductible expenses as well as limited allocations (not to exceed 8.33% of total annual salaries and wages) to a reserve for severance compensation. Provisions pertaining to actual liability for severance compensation per year are also allowed, provided the related plans, based on collective bargaining agreements, are approved by the employer and employees.
## Fines and penalties
Charges, penalties, and interest charged by any government institutions are not deductible.
## Taxes
All taxes are deductible, except income tax and VAT when these are not considered as a cost.
## Net operating losses
Operating losses may not be carried forward for deduction from otherwise taxable profits. Guatemalan laws also do not permit carryback of losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Deduction for royalties will be allowed, up to 5% of gross income. The deductible expenses for technical services rendered from abroad shall not exceed 5% of gross income.
Expenses incurred abroad by non-residents in connection with income earned from Guatemalan sources cannot be deducted for income tax purposes by merely having the supporting receipts, as the regulations to the law do not permit such a deduction for these purposes, unless these expenses are related with the Guatemalan company operations and these expenses are needed for generating taxable income.


# Guatemala
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
There is no consolidation for tax purposes, as each group entity is treated as an independent taxpayer that shall file its own tax returns.
## Transfer pricing
All companies that have any transaction with a related party abroad should have a transfer pricing study.
From a Guatemalan transfer pricing perspective, the scope of application of the rules of valuation of transactions between related parties reaches any operation that has been carried out between a person living in Guatemala with a resident abroad.
Local legislation allows the selection of traditional methods and profit-based methods consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines as well as a sixth method applicable to imports and exports.
Advance pricing agreements (APAs) are permitted, and it is also stated that the tax authority can reclassify activities according to its true nature in accordance with Tax Code statements.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation applies regarding deductible expenses for interest paid. The deductible amount for such costs may not exceed the value of multiplying the annual maximum simple interest rate determined by the Guatemalan Monetary Board for tax purposes by three times the amount of average total net assets submitted by the taxpayer in the annual income tax return.
Average total net assets is defined as the sum of total net assets of the previous year and total net assets at the end of the year in force (both values must correspond to the amounts filed in the annual income tax return of each period of final settlement) divided by two. Total net assets are defined by law to correspond to the book value of all goods that are actually the property of the taxpayer.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Guatemala does not have any provisions regulating CFCs.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025

Guatemala has no provisions or agreements signed to avoid international double taxation, and no foreign tax credit is allowed.
## Drawback industries (_maquila_)
The Law of Promotion and Development of Exports Activities and Drawback Industries is known in Guatemala as _maquila_. This law seeks to promote, encourage, and develop the manufacture of products within areas controlled by the Customs Authority for export to countries outside the Central American region, as well as to regulate exporting and drawback activities.
The exporter may apply for authorisation to operate under any of the following three systems provided by the law:
  * Export under a temporary admission system. 
  * Export under the reimbursement of duties system. 
  * Export under the total added national component system. 


Tax incentives and benefits of the law include the following:
  * Exemption of taxes, import duties, and other charges on imports of machinery and equipment, including VAT.

     * These interests are paid to a multilateral entity. 
     * These interests are paid from a Guatemalan banking or financial entity to a similar entity abroad. 


Non-residents can operate in Guatemala with or without PE; accordingly, income tax treatment depends of the circumstance as follows:
  * Non-residents with PE will be subject to income tax, choosing one of the two methods of payment established for residents. 
  * Non-residents without PE will be subject to WHT, applying specific rates according to the nature of the services rendered. 


## Tax treaties
Guatemala has no tax treaties in force.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Accurate and current information regarding taxation in Guatemala is often difficult to obtain as the country lacks reporting services such as those available in other countries. It is also difficult to determine how the tax laws will be applied in practice in complex situations. The laws and regulations are limited and ordinarily cover only the most common situations. The system of legal precedent resulting from court decisions is narrowly used, and each issue is resolved by reference to the respective codes. Guatemala has shown little interest in tax planning, but it is possible to have informal consultations with the tax authorities and to obtain authoritative rulings in many cases. Discrepancies between government and management criteria are commonly brought to judgment by the Constitutional Court, whose binding sentences generally abrogate the laws in dispute.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The tax system of Guatemala is a unitary system, whereby income of all kinds, other than capital gains, is lumped together and subject to a single tax. The components of gross income subject to tax are usually business income, interest, dividends, rent, salaries, and services. Companies are subject to income tax only on their Guatemala-source income. Dividends and other income payable abroad are taxed separately by way of withholding taxes (WHTs).
For income tax purposes, there are two main systems that taxpayers may subscribe to: the system on earnings from lucrative activities and the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities. The taxpayer chooses what system the company is registered for. Once a system is chosen, it cannot be modified until the next tax period. The request for the modification must be requested before the tax authorities at least one month prior to the new tax period.
These systems are explained below.
## System on earnings from lucrative activities
Under the system on earnings from lucrative activities, the tax is determined and paid at the end of each quarter, without prejudicing the end-of-period final tax liquidation. The tax rate is 25% on net income.
This system allows taxpayers to deduct costs and expenses incurred during the period, according to requirements established by law.
## Simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities
Under the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities, the tax is payable under flat tax withholdings (the tax is to be retained by either the customer or the recipient of services) or by direct remittances to the tax office made monthly within the first ten working days of the month following the invoice date. The tax rate is 5% on gross income that ranges from 0.01 Guatemalan quetzales (GTQ) to GTQ 30,000 and 7% on the excess.
## Local income taxes
There are no specific state or provincial government taxes on income other than the two systems previously described.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
A 12% VAT is levied on the sale or transfer of merchandise and on non-personal services rendered or effected in Guatemala. The tax is payable to the government by way of the invoice method, whereby the tax charged to the customers is offset by the VAT paid over purchases, and the government collects the net resulting amount. The issuance and circulation of credit titles is VAT-exempt.
### Sale of goods
The taxable amount on the sale of goods includes the sales price, less any discounts provided under sound commercial practices, plus other charges shown on the invoice.
### Services
The taxable amount of services includes the price of the service, less any discounts provided under sound commercial practices, plus financial charges and products used to render the services.
### Imports and leases
The tax base for imports is the value declared for import duties computation purposes.
The tax base for leases of movable or immovable property is the value of the lease.
### Exempted sales and services
The following items are exempt from VAT:
  * Importations made by: 
    * cooperatives legally constituted as registered on imported machinery, equipment, and other goods relating to the activity or service of the cooperative 
    * individuals and juridical entities under temporary importation regulations, and 
    * diplomatic and consular missions accredited before the Guatemalan government. 


* Banking institution services and their agents. 
* The issuance, circulation, and transfer of credit bonds, value bonds, and stocks of any kind. 
* Interest accrued by credit bonds and other obligations issued by mercantile partnerships, negotiated through an authorised stock exchange. 
* Exports of goods and services. 
* Contributions and donations to educational, cultural, assistance, or security service partnerships, constituted as not-for-profit entities. 
### VAT return
The amount payable to the _Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria_ (SAT), Guatemala’s tax authority, is the difference between the debits and credits accrued during the tax period (one month) and is paid monthly by filing a tax return in the calendar month following the end of each tax period.
### Refunds of VAT
The VAT credit can be claimed on monthly, quarterly, or semiannual tax periods. The refund of VAT credit corresponds to exporter taxpayers who cannot offset the VAT credit with VAT debits.
In addition, the VAT credit can be claimed by those taxpayers who have a high percentage of sales to entities exempt from VAT.
## Import duties
The Customs Duties on Imports (DAI) are contained in the Central American Tariff System (SAC), which contains the tax rates applicable to goods imported into the Guatemalan Territory, ranging from 0% to 20%.
The import duties apply to the customs value declared by the importer.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are applicable to specific activities, such as fuel distribution tax, alcohol and beverages distribution tax, and tobacco distribution tax.
### Fuel distribution tax
Product | GTQ per gallon  
---|---  
Premium fuel | 4.7  
Regular fuel | 4.6  
Aviation fuel | 4.7  
Diesel/gal oil | 1.3  
Kerosene (DPK) | 0.5  
Avjet turbo fuel | 0.5  
Naphtha | 0.5  
Petroleum liquid gas | 0.5  
### Alcohol and beverages distribution tax

Distilled alcoholic beverages | 8.5  
Alcoholic mixed beverages | 7.5  
Fermented drinks | 7.5  
### Tobacco distribution tax
Tobacco distribution tax is 100% of the factory selling price of a 10-pack package.
## Real estate taxes
Real estate taxes are assessed annually at GTQ 2 per thousand on declared property values from GTQ 2,000 to GTQ 20,000, at GTQ 6 per thousand on values from GTQ 20,000 to GTQ 70,000, and at GTQ 9 per thousand on values in excess of GTQ 70,000 (e.g. property valued at GTQ 1 million will pay real estate taxes of GTQ 9,000).
## Transfer of property
VAT is payable on the first sale of real estate, and subsequent sales are taxed under the stamp tax regime.
## Stamp taxes
Other than sales invoices, contracts, and documents subject to VAT, and other minor exemptions, a stamp tax must be paid on all documents covering commercial and legal transactions (e.g. collection of dividends), either by preparing the document on _papel sellado_ , which is special stamped paper, or by affixing stamps on the documents. This tax is also assessed on documents issued abroad, other than drafts or promissory notes and commercial invoices from foreign suppliers. Letters of credit and acceptances involving international transfers of funds are generally exempt from stamp taxes.
The normal tax rate is 3% and is calculated on the face value of the documents or on the gross value of the related transaction.
The stamp tax on dividend payments or credits has been repealed, and a 5% income tax should be paid on dividend payments or credits in account equity.
## Solidarity tax (_Impuesto de Solidaridad_ or ISO)
The ISO tax rate of 1% is assessed on the net assets of a corporation, or on the gross income of a corporation, whichever is higher, and there is no limit on the amount to be paid. Tax paid may be credited against the corporation’s income tax. If the ISO exceeds the income tax, no reimbursement is possible.
The tax is to be paid quarterly on the basis of the corporation’s opening balance sheet for each fiscal period.
## Payroll taxes
There are no payroll taxes other than social security contributions (_see below_).
## Social security contributions
Corporations contribute 12.67% of their monthly payroll and employees contribute 4.83% of their monthly salary to social security.
