## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 22 January 2025
Income Tax Law number 8 for the year 2011 (and its amendments) is the applicable Law in Palestine. According to this Law ‘all realised incomes in Palestine from any source for any person are taxable unless there is a clear tax exemption in the Income Tax Law’.
## Personal income tax rates 
Employees who are working in Palestine are subject to tax on their wages, salaries, and benefits according to the following yearly brackets and rates:
  * From 1 to 75,000 Israeli shekels (ILS): 5% 
  * From ILS 75,001 to ILS 150,000: 10% 
  * From ILS 150,001 and above: 15% 


_See the section for specific exemptions for residents_.
## Resident withholding tax (WHT)
WHT must be deducted on payments to residents if such payments exceed ILS 2,500 according to the percentage or amount specified in the WHT certificate issued by the Tax Department. In case the WHT certificate is not provided, the payer must deduct 10% of the payment and transfer it to Tax Department.
## Non-resident WHT
According to Income Tax Law, a resident person who pays any amount to a non-resident that is subject to tax under the provisions of this law shall withhold tax at a rate of 10% of the payment amount as a final tax and transfer it to the account of the Tax Department. If the resident fails to withhold the required tax, it shall be collected from the resident as a party responsible for paying it.
## WHT on dividend
Currently, dividends are exempt from income tax, and there is no WHT on dividends. However, it is expected that a 10% tax on dividend will be imposed.

### Assessing the tax
The tax shall be assessed as follows:
  * Self-assessment by the taxpayer by submitting the tax declaration and its attachments. 
  * Administrative assessment by the assessor if the taxpayer did not submit the tax declaration or if it is totally or partially rejected. 
  * Assessment by agreement between the taxpayer and the Department on the amount of tax liability if the assessor does not accept the self-assessment or the taxpayer objects to the administrative assessment. 
  * Assessment by the Court. 


## Payment of tax
Payments must be made in advance as either:
  * One single payment (entitling the taxpayer to a discount). 
  * Equal instalments: 
    * First instalment: End of quarter one. 
    * Second instalment: End of quarter two. 
    * Third instalment: End of quarter three. 
    * Fourth instalment: End of quarter four. 


Any remaining tax liability will be paid along with the tax return.
For payroll tax and WHT, payments must be paid through the employer on a monthly basis.
## Tax audit process
After submitting the tax returns, the income tax department normally verifies the return and may require adjustments and hold meetings with the taxpayer before its final settlement is reached and signed by both parties.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is four years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of focus for the Palestinian Tax Authorities include declaration of the total taxable income from all sources.
