## Corporate income tax (CIT) regulations on passive income
The Tax Office Resolution Nbr. 488/023 establishes the conditions in which the provisions of Law Nbr. 20,095 and Decree Nbr. 395/022 will apply in relation to certain items of foreign-sourced passive income, including the following:
  * Income derived from the sale or economic use of trademarks outside the national territory is considered as Uruguayan sourced when obtained by an entity that is part of a multinational group.
  * Income derived from notional interest and from exchange differences will not be considered within the scope of these rules. Exchange rate differences shall not derive from real estate capital yields, dividends, interest, royalties, or from trademarks.
  * For the purposes of the determination of the condition of qualified entity, making necessary strategic decisions refers to those related to the acquisition, holding, or disposal of the assets generating passive income regulated by the rules.
  * An entity shall be considered to have as its main activity the acquisition and maintenance of equity interests in other entities or real estate when the average at the end of each month of the assets directly associated with such activities represent at least 75% of its total assets during the entire holding period. To be a qualified entity, as far as human resources are concerned, the required extremes will be met when most of its personnel is qualified and based in Uruguay, or when at least it has a qualified Director residing in the national territory.
  * The information to be included in the annual affidavits on qualified income and qualified entities is established, as well as the deadlines for filing them. It is determined that the entities must keep the documentation that reliably supports the information provided in the affidavits for the statute of limitations period.


## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
The DTT signed in November 2021 between Colombia and Uruguay for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital was approved by the Uruguayan Parliament on 12 December 2022. As of June 2024, approval by the Colombian Parliament is still pending.
The DTT signed in June 2019 between Brazil and Uruguay for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital entered into force on 21 July 2023. Its provisions generally apply from 1 January 2024.
## Low-or-no-tax jurisdictions (LNTJs)
The Executive Power established the requirements for a country to be considered as an LNTJ. In this context, the Uruguayan tax authorities are empowered to issue a consolidated list for tax and transfer pricing purposes of countries, jurisdictions, and regimes that meet the conditions in order to be considered as an LNTJ.
On 29 December 2022, the Uruguayan tax authorities issued Resolution 2470/2022, which became effective from 1 January 2023. According to this Resolution, as of 1 January 2023, the following jurisdictions are considered as an LNTJ:
Angola | Jordan | Saint Martin  
---|---|---  
Ascension Island | Kiribati | Saint Pierre and Miquelon  
Christmas Island | Labuan | Solomon Islands  
Cocos (Keeling) Islands | Liberia | Svalbard  
Djibouti | Niue | Swaziland  
Falkland Islands | Norfolk Island | Tokelau  
Fiji | Pacific Islands | Tonga  
French Polynesia | Palau | Tristan da Cunha  
Guam | Pitcairn Islands | Tuvalu  
Guyana | Puerto Rico | US Virgin Islands  
Honduras | Saint Helena | Yemen  
## Value-added tax (VAT) relief of tourist activities
On 22 April 2024, Decree Nbr. 106/024 was issued extending the term of the provisions set forth in Decree 318/021 until 30 September 2024. The regulations established that the following activities will have a reduction of 9% in the VAT rate (standard rate 22%), provided the transactions are executed through electronic means:
  * Gastronomic services provided by restaurants, bars, canteens, cafes, tea rooms, and alike, or by hotels, motels, apart hotels, inns, tourist stays, country hotels, tourist farms, country inns, country houses, and camping hostels, provided that the services do not include lodging.
  * Catering services for parties and events.
  * Parties and events services not included above.
  * Vehicles rental without chauffeur.
  * Mediation services for the leasing of real estate for tourist purposes.


For VAT payers under the 'small companies regime', the reduction is determined by applying a discount of 7.38% on the total amount of the transaction.
## Tax relief for small companies: Regulations
In March 2023, the Executive Branch issued Decrees 65/023, 66/023, 67/023, and 71/023, which introduced modifications to CIT and VAT, aiming to reduce the tax burden to small companies.
Regarding CIT, adjustments impact the amount of the monthly payments to be made during the fiscal year as well as the brackets and percentages defined for the ’IRAE ficto‘ (notional CIT) regime, which will no longer be proportional and will start to be applied as a system of progressive rates.
In addition, it was determined that companies that cease to be included in the small companies’ regime as a result of exceeding the annual income limit (approximately 550,000 United States dollars [USD]) during the fiscal year may return to such simplified regime in the following year, as long as the income of the previous one does not exceed the limit.
## Incentives for professionals and technicians of the information technology (IT) sector
In August 2023, Uruguay passed Law Nbr. 20,191 for the promotion of work and settlement in Uruguay of technicians and professionals of the IT sector. This law aims to attract professionals from abroad, both nationals and foreigners, to professionalise the local IT sector and improve the quality of employment. Said law grants an incentive for IT employees, whereby these individuals may opt for being taxed as non-residents (i.e. 12% flat rate) and opt out of the social security scheme. These options are available for the for the year in which the employment relationship is verified and the following four years.
## Tax benefits for newspaper, radio, and television broadcasting companies
In February 2024, the Executive approved Decree 57/024, which establishes that newspaper, radio, and television broadcasting companies are now included in the exemptions set forth in article 69 of the Constitution of Uruguay, provided their annual income does not exceed approximately USD 600,000.
## Accountability Law for Fiscal Year 2022
On 6 November 2023, Uruguay passed Law of Accountability for Fiscal Year 2022, which introduces certain tax provisions that will take effect on 1 January 2024. Among others, the following relevant provisions were introduced.
### Mergers and spin-offs
Legal status is granted to the rule that excludes from computing for tax purposes the goodwill in intra-group restructurings that are not tax-driven and provided the following conditions are met:
  * The ultimate beneficiaries from the entities to be merged or spun off are exactly the same, maintaining at least 95% of their equity proportions and not modifying them for the following two years.
  * The operations must be carried out at the book value.
  * Compliance with reporting the merger or spin-off to the appropriate public registries.
  * The core business before the merger or spin-off take place must be kept for the following two years.


In case of non-compliance of the above, taxes must be paid without penalties and interests. The statute of limitations applicable in this case will be ten years. The successor companies will be jointly responsible for the tax obligations of their predecessors in the event of non-compliance.
### Transfer of equity shares
Transfer of equity shares of Uruguayan tax-resident legal entities will be considered carried out at their fiscal value, and thus no tax due would be derived from these operations, provided that the following conditions are met:
  * The transferors and transferees are tax residents in Uruguay.
  * The ultimate beneficiaries from the transferors and transferees are exactly the same, maintaining at least 95% of their equity proportions and not modifying them for the following four years.
  * The transferees maintain the shares for the following four years.
  * The price of the operation equals the book value of the equity shares transferred.
  * Compliance with reporting the merger or spin-off to the appropriate public registries.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year closing date may be chosen by the company. However, certain sectors or industries have mandatory closing dates.
## Tax returns
CIT and NWT are self-assessed, and their tax returns are filed by the end of the fourth month following the date of the year-end.
## Payment of tax
Income and capital taxes are paid monthly by way of advanced payments, which are calculated on the basis of the previous year’s tax. The difference between the advanced tax payments and the total annual tax calculated at fiscal year-end is paid by the end of the fourth month after the fiscal year-end.
## Tax audit process
The taxpayer has the right to appeal an Administrative Act to the Tax Office (DGI) and, simultaneously, to the Executive Branch in an administrative process. Both appeals must be filed jointly within ten days from the notification of the administrative act. If both appeals are tacitly (not expressly resolved within a period of 150 days) or expressly rejected, the taxpayer has the right to appeal to a special court through a judicial proceeding.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Uruguay is five years, which can be extended to ten years in the case of: (i) tax fraud, (ii) not complying with Tax Office registration, (iii) lack of communication of a taxable event, or (iv) not submitting a tax return (among other cases).


# Uruguay
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
Legal entities are deemed to be resident in Uruguay when they are incorporated according to the local legislation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The concept of PE in the Uruguayan tax legislation follows, in general terms, the definition provided in the OECD Model Tax Convention, although it has some special clauses that may be found in the United Nations (UN) Model Tax Convention. From a Uruguayan law perspective, the term PE means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on in Uruguay. The term PE especially includes: (i) places of management; (ii) branches; (iii) offices; (iv) factories; (v) workshops; (vi) mines, oil or gas wells, quarries, or any other place of extraction of natural resources; (vii) buildings, constructions, installation projects, or the management activities associated to them, when they last more than three months; and (viii) services, including consultancy services, rendered by a non-resident through employees or other hired personnel by the company for that purpose, to the extent that such activities are developed (in relation with the same or a connected project) during a period or periods exceeding, in total, six months within any 12-month period. Please note that item (viii) constitutes an exception to the OECD model and is based on the provisions of the UN model.
Rules in force expressly state that operations undertaken by taxpayers with, among others, branches or PEs will be subject to the transfer pricing regime. Head offices and their branches/PE must be considered as separate entities for tax purposes, and the transactions and balances between them must be recognised based on the arm's-length principle, with the exception of financial operations.


# Uruguay
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
As a general rule, accrued and duly documented expenses that are necessary to obtain and preserve gross taxable income are tax deductible. On the contrary, those expenses associated with deriving or preserving income not subject to CIT are not deductible from the taxable basis. Furthermore, for CIT purposes, all costs and expenses will be subject to the compulsory proportional deduction _mentioned in the section_ (with some exceptions).
## Depreciation and depletion
Straight-line depreciation over useful life is mandatory. Specific rates exist for the following cases: (i) 2% per year for urban buildings, (ii) 3% per year for rural buildings, and (iii) not less than 10% per year for new vehicles. Other rates are accepted if economically justified. No conformity between book and tax depreciation is required.
Percentages for depletion computed on the cost of natural resource properties are allowed in accordance with generally accepted criteria.
Depreciation and depletion percentages are computed on the historical cost of fixed assets revaluated at year-end, based on the variation of the CPI. Capital gains derived from the revaluation of fixed assets are not taxable income.
### Production of software and related services
Law 19,637 introduced amendments to the exemption applicable for activities of production of software and related services, provided the assets are developed, at least partially, in Uruguay. This decree introduces the following complementary provisions regarding the regulation of the referred exemption:
  * In order to be deducted, losses incurred in the acquisition of software from partially exempted CIT payers must be reflected in the respective documentation. 
  * 60% of the expenses incurred in software development and related services that are exempted incomes of CIT to the counterpart can be deducted.
  * The depreciation of software acquired as of 1 January 2018 will be deductible in application to the percentage of exempted income.
  * For tax purposes, the property from the assets produced will be attributed to the company that carried out such activities to the extent it has the exclusive right of use and exploitation conceded from the partner or shareholder that registered it under the protection of IP regulations.
  * The documentation that supports its operative must include the registry number of the asset and the corresponding percentage of exoneration in order to be exempted.


## Goodwill
When transferring a business or a business unit, the difference between sales/transfer price and the fiscal cost of the assets being transferred constitutes 'goodwill'. This goodwill is an asset for the buyer and must not be depreciated, neither for CIT nor for NWT purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses should be depreciated within a period of three to five years. The taxpayer may elect the number of years to depreciate those expenses within those limits.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses, as well as other costs and expenses, are subject to the compulsory proportional deduction _mentioned in the section_.
When companies derive both income subject to CIT and either income exempt or not included in CIT (e.g. from a foreign source), interest expenses associated to the former (i.e. deductible interest) will be determined by applying a proportion based on assets.
## Bad debts
As a general rule, only those debts that are at least 18 months old will be deductible as 'bad debts'. However, the rules allow deductions under some other special situations.
## Charitable contributions
Deductibility of charitable contributions will depend on the organisations receiving them.
Furthermore, there is a special regime for certain charitable contributions under which the contributor may deduct 25% of the contribution, and the remaining 75% will be recovered through credit certificates that may be used to pay taxes (with certain limitations).
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties generated from unduly paid taxes are not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Taxes
CIT and NWT are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Law 19,438 (October 2016) limited the deduction of tax losses from previous years to 50% of the net tax income. However, Law 19,924 (Budget Law 2020 - 2024) eliminated this limitation. In this sense, as of the years ended on 31 December 2020, taxpayers with accumulated losses may deduct them without considering the aforementioned cap.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
All accrued expenses that are necessary for the generation of Uruguayan-source income and that are duly documented are allowed as deductions. Additionally, a taxpayer may deduct expenses from its gross income if such expenses are subject to taxation (either via foreign or local taxation) in the hands of the other party. A compulsory proportional deduction must be calculated when the taxation in the hands of the counterpart is lower than 25% (CIT rate).


# Uruguay
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Uruguay.
Specific provisions regarding the existence of an 'administrative economic unit' are included in NWT law, but only for agricultural and/or farming investments for determining the application of NWT exemption and corresponding NWT rates (i.e. group taxation is still not permitted).
## Transfer pricing
As a general principle, transfer pricing rules are applicable to international transactions between related parties. However, Uruguayan legislation has extended the scope of these regulations to transactions carried out with LNTJs (either international or domestic) and to certain operations through third-party intermediaries. Domestic transactions with Uruguayan FZ users fall under this category.
The definition adopted by the law for related parties is quite broad. Such a relationship is configured when both parties are subject (directly or indirectly) to the management or control of the same individuals or legal entities, or when they have power of decision to direct or define the taxpayer’s activities due either to their participation in capital interest, the level of their credit rights, or their functional or any other type of influence (whether contractual or not).
All taxpayers subject to the transfer pricing regime should have the documents and other supporting evidence justifying the transfer prices used and the comparison criteria applied in order to duly demonstrate the prices/amounts declared in their annual tax return.
The transfer pricing documentation shall be kept by the taxpayers for the statute of limitations period (five years; this can be extended to ten years in the case of failure to obtain sworn declarations, failure to register with the tax authorities, or fraud).
In the annual tax return (which expires by the fourth month after the fiscal year-end), all taxpayers must inform whether a transfer pricing adjustment applies (and its amount), as well as the inter-company transactions performed during the fiscal year.
Taxpayers that perform inter-company transactions that exceed the threshold stipulated by rules in force (50 million 'Indexed Units', equivalent to approximately USD 7,775,000, within the fiscal year), or are notified by the tax authorities, will be required to file the following annual information to the tax authorities within the ninth month after the year-end:
  * Transfer pricing documentation (Local File) in Spanish with minimum content (functional analysis: functions performed, risks assumed and assets used; economic analysis: amount of each inter-company transaction; method selected as the most appropriate and the transfer pricing adjustment).
  * Informative tax return (exhaustive information about the taxpayer and group is required).
  * Financial statements.


It is important to note that there is a new annual obligation for taxpayers that integrate a multinational enterprise of large economic dimensions (i.e. those whose consolidated income exceeds 750 million euros [EUR]) and verify the related party assumptions to file, in addition to the current local file, a Country-by-Country (CbC) report. Additionally, Master File requirements were established (to be specified yet who will be required to file it). Such obligation is in force for fiscal years initiated as of 1 January 2017.
### Country-by-Country (CbC) report
A CbC report is required in Uruguay for fiscal years commencing after 1 January 2017. Legislation contemplates an annual obligation for Uruguayan taxpayers that integrate a multinational enterprise (MNE) of large economic dimensions. To this effect, MNE groups of large economic dimensions are defined as those whose total consolidated income at the end of the group's fiscal year exceeds EUR 750 million.
Taxpayers that comply with these regulations shall submit to the local tax authorities the CbC report. Information shall be submitted to the Uruguayan Tax Office (_Dirección General Impositiva_ [DGI]), and could be used by local tax authorities for complying with their duties and for the exchange of information with competent authorities of foreign states, in the framework of international agreements and respective protocols of understanding ratified by Uruguay, ensuring confidentiality and reciprocity.
Taxpayers will not be subject to file a CbC report when the return is submitted by an entity that integrates the MNE to a foreign tax administration of a jurisdiction with whom Uruguay has an exchange of information agreement in force, and the report can be effectively exchanged with the tax authorities of the jurisdictions of the MNE.
In this sense, taxpayers belonging to MNE groups of large economic dimensions are required to fill a CbC notification. The notification must include the identity and tax residence of the reporting entity. It must be filed annually, prior to the closing date of the report.
Regarding the CbC report, it must be submitted (if corresponds) within a period of 12 months, counting from the closing date of the group’s fiscal year referred to in the report.
### Master File
The minimum content to be included in the Master File is determined by the Regulatory Decree. Taxpayers required to submit the Master File shall prepare a special return to be filed to the DGI within a period of 12 months, counting from the closing date of the group's fiscal year referred to in the report. It is worth mentioning that, at the moment, there is no threshold that determines the obligation of submitting the report.
### Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)
Regarding transfer pricing administration rules, the Executive Power can enter into APAs with taxpayers that cannot cover more than three fiscal years. Additionally, since 2017, the Executive Power can also enter into BAPAs, which includes not only the negotiation with local taxpayers but also with other tax authorities from countries with which the local taxpayer could have inter-company transactions. 
Furthermore, strong penalties are set for failure of compliance with transfer pricing formal duties and with other formal documentation requirements.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Uruguay.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Uruguay other than those applicable to individuals.


# Uruguay
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
CIT is imposed at a rate of 25% on net income derived from business activities carried out in Uruguay. A 7% WHT is imposed on profits remitted or credited to a head office. Profits paid or credited to a non-resident head office will not be subject to WHT when they are paid out of non-taxable income for CIT purposes.
Furthermore, those profits and/or losses derived from financial operations between the branch and its head office will be disregarded for Uruguayan tax purposes (i.e. not taxed in case of income or not deductible in case of costs and/or expenses).


# Uruguay
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Non-qualified entities obtaining non-qualified passive income of foreign source will be liable to CIT, having the right to credit the analogous income tax paid in the foreign jurisdiction against the CIT generated by the same items of income. This credit cannot exceed the portion of the tax calculated prior to the deduction.
## CIT reduction for income reinvested in fixed assets
40% of income reinvested in the purchase of (i) industrial and agricultural machinery, (ii) vehicles and installations, (iii) computers, (iv) telecommunications equipment, and (v) some assets for the tourism industry is exempt from CIT.
20% of income reinvested in the construction and expansion of industrial, agricultural, and tourism buildings is exempt from CIT (limited to 40% of net taxable income in the year of expenditure).
The joint amount of said investments can be deducted from the taxable basis, with a limit of 40% of the annual net profit, once the amount of other exemptions has been deducted. The excess can be deducted (with the same limitations) in the following two tax periods. It is important to mention that income exempt by these provisions cannot be distributed and must be retained as a reserve account, which ultimately can only be capitalised.
Note that the above-mentioned CIT benefit will be exclusively applicable to taxpayers whose income, in the immediately preceding fiscal year to which the investment is executed, does not exceed the amount of 10 million 'Indexed Units' (approximately USD 1,555,000). This limitation is not applicable to professional cargo transport companies.
## NWT exemption
Movable fixed assets directly connected to the industrial cycle and equipment for data processing are exempt from NWT.
All assets directly associated to the development of agricultural and/or farming activities will be exempt from NWT as long as the owners are individuals or companies with nominative shares also owned by individuals. As a consequence of the elimination of the Rural Real Estate Concentration Tax (ICIR), this NWT exemption has been modified. According to Law Nbr. 19,088, this exemption will apply only in cases where the referred assets do not exceed 12 million ‘Indexed Units’ (approximately USD 1,866,000).
## Investment Law 16,906
Uruguay has modified Investment Law 16,906, achieving a better framework for local and foreign investments carried out in the country. To obtain tax benefits, the Investment Law requires that enterprises obtain a government statement in this regard. The Bureau of Investor Assistance is in charge of monitoring the correct compliance of these projects.
The Investment Law grants two types of benefits:
### Automatic benefits
This kind of benefit is only for manufacturing, extractive, or farming/ranching activities, and includes:
  * Exemption from NWT for chattel property directly engaged in the production cycle and data-processing equipment.
  * Exemption from VAT and CIT paid on the importation of such goods, and reimbursement of VAT in the case of locally purchased items.


### Discretionary benefits
Benefits that may be obtained at the discretion of the Executive Power for any type of business activity (not cumulative with automatic benefits) include:
  * VAT and CIT exemptions (among other taxes) on importation of fixed assets items.
  * NWT exemptions: Permanent for chattel property items, for a period of eight years for construction work in Montevideo (capital city), and for a period of ten years in the rest of the country.
  * VAT reimbursement on local purchase of goods and services for civil construction work.
  * Exemption from CIT, depending on the nature and size of the project to be carried out. The Executive Power takes into account the following criteria to grant this benefit: 
    * Implementation of 'clean' technologies.
    * Contribution to export growth and diversification.
    * Contribution to geographic decentralisation.
    * Improvement of technological investigation, innovation, and development.
    * Generation of employment.


### Regulatory framework for the Investment Promotion Law - Decree 268/020 
It is worth mentioning that the Executive Power updated the regulatory framework for the Investment Promotion Law in 2020. In this regard, it establishes a transition period for the presentation of projects for which it is possible to opt to apply the previous regime (Decree Nbr. 143/018).
Regarding tax benefits, CIT exempted in each fiscal year may not exceed 90% of the tax. If convenient for the taxpayer, the computation term of the exoneration might be suspended for up to two years.
The indicators established by the previous regime through which the tax benefit is determined remain in force, but the new provisions modify their burden in the matrix and the calculation method.
Nevertheless, all investment projects could be assessed through a simplified matrix with only one indicator: job creation.
  * Exemption of CIT: From 42% to 69%.
  * Period: 5 to 7 years.


The calculation of the amount of CIT exemption and the effective period for this benefit is established on the basis of a score determined by the amount of investment committed (tranches) and the number of people to be employed.
On 30 November 2022, the Commission for the Application of the Investment Law issued a document that adjusts the basic general criteria for the operation of Decree 268/020, which modifies the methodology for the calculation of certain indicators and the limits applicable to investments in utility vehicles, electric vehicles, and renewable energies.
### Amendments to Investment Promotion Regime: Law 19,637
Law 19,637 introduced measures in order to promote investments in small companies, generate new incentives for investment and productive development, and adjust the applicable exemption for the software industry.
The main provisions approved are the following:
  * CIT exemption for research and development (R&D) activities in areas of biotechnology, bioinformatics, and software production, provided the assets are developed, at least in part, in Uruguay, or the services related to the referred activities are provided in the country.
  * Increase in CIT exemption related to foreseen automatic benefits, going from 40% to 60% in the case of certain investments in movable assets and from 20% to 30% in certain investments in real estate construction. It is applicable to CIT payers whose income from the previous year does not exceed 5 million 'Indexed Units' (approximately USD 777,000).
  * As part of these regulations, Decree 138/020 included large-scale economic construction projects for the sale or lease of real estate for office or residential use in the benefits provided by the Investment Law. For these purposes, large-scale economic projects are those of 30 million ‘Indexed Units’ (approximately USD 4.5 million). Recently, through the enactment of Decree 23/024, the deadline for the execution of certain investments included in this regime was extended till 30 September 2027, subject to certain conditions.


## CIT exemption for R&D activities in biotechnology, bioinformatics, and software production
The regulations establish a legal framework for the CIT exemption condition for R&D activities in biotechnology and bioinformatics and software production, referring to the fact that to be exempted the assets resulting from the aforementioned activities shall be registered according to the IP protection and registration regulations.
The exemption will apply if the assets are executed, at least partly, in Uruguay, and the amount exempted will be calculated considering the relative weight of the direct development costs incurred in Uruguay in relation to the costs incurred in the rest of the world. The assets that result from such activities can be used abroad as well as locally.
Within the services related to the activity, services of technical advice in the areas of biotechnology and bioinformatics provided by the entities that carry out R&D activities, in relation to certain products, are included.
In addition, a full exemption is available, provided that the referred services are developed in Uruguay. Said fact will be verified when the company employs full-time human resources in accordance with the services provided, and the amount of expenses and direct costs incurred in the country for the provision of said services is adequate and exceeds 50% of the amount of expenses and total direct costs incurred in the year for the provision of the same.
Finally, the exemption is limited to those entities that are CIT payers by their legal status (it excludes some taxpayers that are not corporate entities).
In this context, Resolution 183/020 establishes the frequency in which the tax returns must be filed and the information they must contain for the application of the exemption.
## Auto-saving ‘direction’ benefit
The auto-saving ‘direction’ benefit allows a company to deduct from the CIT basis the amount of the capital increase that occurred as a consequence of the reserves capitalisation or of the in-kind distribution of shares, for an amount equivalent to the investment carried out with the investor’s own funds. The amount of the CIT deduction and the period(s) to which said exemption will apply is granted by the government through a statement issued by the Executive Power.
## Free zones 
Following the approval of the Free Zone Law in 1987, this system became an important tool for attracting investments to Uruguay.
It has been utilised for carrying out traditional activities in the free zones (warehousing, logistics, and distribution), for the provision of services (software, finance, call centres, etc.), and for manufacturing activities.
This regime, established by Law Nbr. 15,921 in 1987, was modified in 2017 by Law 19,566 (hereinafter the 'New Law', in force since 8 March 2018), which introduced changes (in line with OECD recommendations) without affecting the rights acquired by free zone users (as guaranteed by the Uruguayan government).
The Law declares 'of national interest in the promotion and development of the free zones, with the objectives of promoting investments, diversifying the productive matrix, generating employment, increasing the capacities of the national labour force, increasing the national added value, promoting the activities of high technological content and innovation, promoting the decentralisation of economic activities and regional development, and in general terms, promoting the insertion of the country in the dynamics of international trade in goods and services and international investment flows'.
Free zones are privately or publicly owned isolated and fenced off areas of Uruguayan territory determined by the Executive Branch with the purpose of carrying out all types of manufacturing, commercial, and service activities within the zone, while enjoying tax exemptions and other benefits envisaged in the law.
Companies in these areas cannot carry out industrial, trading, or service activities in the non-free zone Uruguayan territory (the New Law introduces modifications in this regard; _see below_), except for services expressly authorised by the government (_listed_ below) but are allowed to render all types of services within the free zones or to third countries. Also, Resolution 231/019 specifies that free zone users can provide services to non-free zone territory if the beneficiary of said services is a taxpayer taxed by CIT.
Free zone users are allowed to render the following services to the non-free zone Uruguayan territory:
  * International call centres, except for those whose main destination is the non-free zone Uruguayan territory.
  * E-mail.
  * Remote learning.
  * Electronic signature certificate issuance.


In addition, as an exceptional manner, free zone users may perform the following activities outside free zones, within the limits that the Executive Power establishes:
  * Collection of debt portfolio, provided they are made through third parties.
  * Exhibition by free zone users that are settled in free zones with eventual disadvantages of location.


It is also foreseen that users that are settled in free zones located outside the metropolitan area are allowed to perform complementary activities outside the free zone, such as public relations, handling of auxiliary documentation, billing, and collection of goods and services. To do so, they will have administrative offices provided by the free zone operators. It is important to mention that it will not be allowed to carry out operations of sale of goods and services in these administrative offices.
In order to operate in/from the free zone, certain requirements must be fulfilled from an ‘economic substance’ perspective (i.e. there must be an actual economic activity developed in the free zone). In this sense, some modifications were introduced to determine which substantial activities can be developed outside the free zone.
The New Law introduced maximum terms (limits) for free zone contracts, generally up to five, ten, or fifteen years (depending on the activity and type), and filing will be required to free zone users with existing agreements not complying with such limits.
In order to preserve and maintain the condition of free zone status and the corresponding exemptions and benefits, free zone users must employ, as a minimum, 75% of natural or legal Uruguayan citizens within their staff. However, the New Law stated that those free zone users that develop service activities may employ a minimum of 50% of natural or legal Uruguayan citizens during the whole agreement period, as long as the nature of the developed activities requires it and the free zone user makes an effort to employ as many Uruguayan citizens as possible. In this case, an authorisation of the Executive Power will be needed.
Free zone users are exempt from all current and future national taxes, including those taxes for which a specific legal exemption is required, in connection with the activities performed within the free zones. The Uruguayan government guarantees all the exemptions and benefits granted by the law for the term of their contracts. Free zones can be located outside or inside the cities; it depends on the kind of free zone.
The New Law introduced a provision that establishes that income derived from the exploitation of IP rights and other intangible assets will be exempt, provided they derive from R&D activities carried out within the free zone.
Social security taxes, as well as certain WHTs, are excluded from the exemption. WHT on payments of dividends made by these companies to their non-resident shareholders are exempt.
Additionally, the New Law established exemptions for thematic zones for the provision of audio-visual, leisure, and entertainment services outside the metropolitan area.
One of the most relevant changes to the free zone regime is the authorisation for the provision of services from free zone to non-free zone territory, provided the beneficiary of said services is a taxpayer taxed by CIT. In this regard, the regulations establish that the services contracted by CIT payers with free zone user suppliers must be linked to taxable income of the beneficiary. In addition, CIT payers must inform the supplier that they meet the mentioned conditions before the service is rendered.
The rules establish certain provisions related to activities of R&D, such as the information to be included in a tax return that must be filed annually to the Tax Office and its due date, as well as the attribution of the property of the registered assets.
## CIT exemption for trading activities with transit of goods through Uruguay
The CIT Act establishes a tax exemption for non-residents on income derived from activities performed in Uruguayan customs areas, port customs areas, customs deposits, and free zones, with goods of foreign origin declared in transit or stored in the referred areas. This exemption applies to the extent that such goods are in transit (not having as origin or as destination the Uruguayan customs territory). This exemption also applies on a percentage of the sales that have as final destination the Uruguayan internal market. This tax benefit has been widened and, while originally applicable only to non-residents, is now available for tax residents in Uruguay. In addition, these activities with goods deposited in the country can be performed from outside Uruguay.
## Industrial park incentives
Individuals or legal entities that establish industrial parks within Uruguayan territory, as well as companies located within such industrial parks, are entitled to CIT exemption for their industrial equipment, excise tax and VAT exemption on the acquisitions of such goods, and other benefits.
Decree 170/019 modifies certain provisions regarding incentives granted to industrial park users by Investment Law 16,906. In addition, in May 2018, Decree 143/018 introduced a new regulatory framework to said law.
In this regard, Decree 143/018 established that the exemption of CIT granted to industrial park users and the period in which the benefit applied, as well as the tax credit given in relation to employer retirement contributions, would be increased by 15%.
Notwithstanding this, Decree 70/019 establishes that for those projects that include investments within and outside of the industrial park, the benefits must be calculated over the investment carried out within it. Also, the amount of the tax credit should be determined, taking into consideration the retirement contributions made on behalf of employees that work within the industrial park.
In February 2020, the Executive Power issued the Decree 79/020, which regulates this regime, updated by Decree 408/022 (22 December 2022). The latter introduced more flexible conditions for accessing the benefits and extended certain terms, aiming to make the regime more attractive.
## Holding companies
Uruguayan legal entities holding shares in non-resident entities or investing in assets not located in Uruguay are not subject to tax (due to the application of the source principle) on qualified income, provided they meet the substance requirements to be considered qualified entities (_see Foreign-source income in the section for more information_).
## Tax benefits for Shared Service Centre (SSC) activities
Activities carried out by SSCs are granted relevant tax benefits under certain conditions.
For these purposes, an SSC is defined as an entity that belongs to a group of enterprises, which has as its sole activity the effective provision of any of the following services: advisory and data processing services, management or administration (strategic planning, business development, advertising, management, and staff training), logistics and storage, financial management, and R&D, regardless of the place of use; to at least 12 related parties that belong to the same group of enterprises.
In addition, it is clarified that the exploitation of IP rights is not included in this beneficial regime.
Tax benefits granted include the exemption of CIT of 90% of the income derived from the promoted activities and exemption of NWT on the assets involved for five or ten fiscal year-ends, depending on specific compulsory requirements that must be fulfilled. To have access to the five year-end tax benefits, an SSC must comply simultaneously with the following conditions:
  * Generate at least 150 new direct qualified jobs at the end of the first three year-ends, jobs that must be preserved until the end of the fifth year-end.
  * Implement a training plan with a minimum budget of 10 million 'Indexed Units' (approximately USD 1,555,000) for the Uruguayan citizen employees during the whole first three year-ends, which must be for new projects.


The tax exemption period will be extended to ten years when (i) the minimum number of jobs exceeds 300 at the end of the first five year-ends and remains until the end of the exemption period and (ii) the referred training expense exceeds twice the aforementioned amount in the course of the first six year-ends.
Tax benefits under the SSC regime have been extended through Decree Nbr. 330/016. Making benefits more accessible, a CIT exemption of 70% of the income derived from the promoted activities by complying with the following conditions is available:
  * Generate at least 100 new direct qualified jobs at the end of the first three year-ends (fulfilling the same conditions that are required for the original benefits).
  * Implement a training plan with a minimum budget of five million 'Indexed Units' (approximately USD 777,000) for the Uruguayan citizen employees during the whole first three year-ends (fulfilling the same conditions that are required for the original benefits).


It is important to note that for the determination of new direct qualified jobs, those that are related to a decrease in jobs of local related entities will not be considered.
Regarding NWT, the exoneration of the assets affected by the activity promoted by the CIT exemption period remains unchanged.
## Industry-specific incentives
### Printing industry incentives
Companies that print books and educational material are exempt from the NWT and VAT.
### Long distance services and call centres
Companies developing long distance services and call centre activities have special benefits regarding CIT (from 70% to 100% exemption).
### Condo hotels
Companies running a condo hotel have special benefits regarding CIT (from 70% to 100% exemption), among other taxes. There are also exemptions and other tax benefits granted on behalf of the promoting company.
### Electric power industry incentives
Companies that generate electric power from non-traditional energy sources have special benefits regarding CIT (from 40% to 90% exemption).
### Machinery industry incentives
Companies that build and/or assemble (under certain conditions) machinery with agricultural purposes have special benefits regarding CIT (from 50% to 90% exemption).
### Shipping industry incentives

### Forestry plantation incentives
Income derived from forestry plantations made before July 2007 is tax exempted. For income derived from forestry plantations made since July 2007, stricter conditions, such as ‘quality wood’, are required to be exempted from CIT.
### Software, bioinformatics, and biotechnology industry incentives
_See the description of the CIT exemption for R &D activities in biotechnology and bioinformatics and software production above._
### Electronic industry incentives
The production of electronic devices has special benefits regarding CIT (from 50% to 100% exemption).
### Tourism industry incentives
Investments in the tourism industry have tax benefits related to CIT, VAT, and NWT, as follows:
  * Deduction of up to 40% of CIT in investments made in the fiscal year in hotel equipment and equipment for improving entertainment and information services to tourists and deduction of up to 20% of CIT in investments made in construction and expansion of hotel buildings, with the limits mentioned in previous sections (40% of the annual net profit, once the amount of other exemptions has been deducted).
  * VAT refund included in local acquisitions of goods and services for construction, improvement, or expansion of tourist complexes.
  * VAT exemption on import of goods for construction, improvement, or expansion of tourist complexes.
  * The list of operations included in the concept of exports of services for VAT purposes (thus zero-rated and with the possibility to recover input VAT) was broadened to include, among others, services related to accommodation that hotels, apartments, and rural tourism establishments provide to tourists, as well as for international event organisation services. In the context of COVID-19, the zero-rated treatment available to non-residents was extended to accommodation services for Uruguayan residents in high season (November through April).
  * NWT exemption for ten years on investments in infrastructure and civil work for construction, improvement, or expansion of tourist complexes.
  * NWT exemption for four years on fixed assets investment for tourist complexes.
  * 50% exemption of import duties on materials and goods for construction, improvement, or expansion, as well as fixed assets, of tourist complexes.
  * VAT reduction of 9% to the following services: restaurant services not included in the fair for accommodation, catering services for parties and events, parties and events services, vehicles rental without chauffeur, and mediation services in the rental of immovable properties to tourists. This benefit has been extended in the past and is currently available until 30 September 2024.




# Uruguay
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
All Uruguayan-sourced income obtained by non-residents (other than those obtained through a PE in Uruguay) is taxed at flat rates of up to 12% on gross income, with some exceptions. This tax is basically collected by way of WHT.
The exceptions are as follows:
  * Interest on deposits in local currency is taxed at rates from 0.5% to 10%, depending on their terms.
  * Interest on deposits in foreign currencies for terms exceeding one year is taxed at rates from 7% to 12%.
  * Interest on public bonds is not taxed.
  * Dividends paid or credited by CIT payers are taxed at 7%, provided they derive from taxable income (under certain circumstances, non-distributed earnings will also be subject to 7% dividend WHT after three years of being generated).
  * Income obtained by entities resident, domiciled, or located in LNTJs is taxed at 25%.


Although the Uruguayan tax law follows the source principle as a general rule, technical services (defined as those rendered in the fields of management, technical administration, or advice of any kind) rendered in another country by non-residents but associated with taxable income obtained by the local user in Uruguay are considered to be Uruguayan sourced for tax purposes and subject to WHT. However, when the taxable income obtained by the local user of the service does not exceed 10% of its total income, then only 5% of the service fee paid or credited abroad will be subject to non-resident WHT. Therefore, in these cases, the effective WHT rate is 0.6% (5% x 12%). In those cases where the local taxpayer receiving the service does not obtain any taxable income, the service received will be entirely associated to foreign-source income and thus not subject to WHT.
This WHT should be declared and paid to the Tax Office on the month following the one in which the tax is withheld.
For those countries with which Uruguay has entered DTTs, the maximum WHT rates are the following (in those cases where the maximum WHT provided by the DTT is higher than the internal law WHT, the latter will be applicable):
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties  
Under internal law | 0/7 | 0/7/12 | 0/12

## Tax transparency law
Tax Transparency Law Nbr. 19,484 introduced a set of provisions aimed to enhance the achievement of international standards on tax transparency and prevention of money laundering, as follows:
  * Provisions that regulate the automatic information that the financial entities must submit to the Uruguayan Tax Office.
  * Provisions that seek the identification of final beneficiaries of local and foreign entities with a relevant nexus with the country.
  * Tax rules aimed to discourage the use of entities resident, domiciled, or located in LNTJs: 
    * Income derived from the transfer of shares or participations in entities from LNTJs whose assets located in Uruguay exceed 50% of their total investments is deemed to be Uruguayan sourced (thus taxable) for CIT purposes. Similar provisions apply to resident individuals and to non-resident taxpayers.
    * When a resident individual participates (directly or indirectly) in the capital of LNTJ entities, passive income and/or capital gains received by said entities will be assigned as deemed dividend, thus taxed in the hands of the individual beneficiaries.
    * Rates increased from 12% to 25% for Uruguayan-sourced income obtained by entities resident in LNTJs.
  * Adjustments to the transfer pricing regime.


## Bank secrecy and identification of title holders
The inclusion of the request of information by a DTT partner is approved as one of the hypotheses under which banking secrecy can be lifted.
### Identification of holders of shares
The identification of holders of bearer and nominative titles representing the capital of entities domiciled or doing business in Uruguay is mandatory. In this regard, Laws Nbr. 18,930 and 19,484 include the compliance of certain obligations for identification purposes. This obligation relies on the holders, who must identify themselves with the Central Bank of Uruguay, providing not only their identity but also the percentage of their participations in the entity.
Information shall be kept by the Central Bank of Uruguay and subject to secrecy, although the Tax Office, anti-money laundering authorities, penal and family courts, and related entities may access them in certain cases, with sufficient and proved justification.
The duty of identification applies to all entities domiciled in Uruguay and to companies incorporated abroad, provided that they act in Uruguay through a PE or if their management is carried out in Uruguay.
### Identification of ultimate beneficial owners
According to the legislation, entities whose share capital is represented through bearer or nominative certificates must also communicate to the Central Bank of Uruguay not only the ownership of those participations but also the ownership chain until reaching its ultimate beneficial owners.
In this regard, the law considers as ‘beneficial owners’ those natural people who directly or indirectly hold at least 15% of the paid-in capital or its equivalent, the rights to vote, or who otherwise exercise the final control of the company.
The law foresees exemptions to the obligation of communicating the mentioned information, such (i) those particular cases where beneficial owners do not hold at least 15% of the paid-in capital; (ii) companies whose titles are listed on a stock exchange of recognised prestige (national or international); or (iii) when in the ownership chain exists an investment fund or trust, also with their participations contributed publicly in the stock exchange. It is worth mentioning that qualifying for this exception does not necessarily consist in not requesting information from those companies since the form must be filled anyway but with less information requested.
Decree 272/022 (September 2022) modified the graduation of sanctions and added more deadlines. The Decree establishes that the obligated entities will have a maximum period of 90 days from the day following the end of the calendar year in which they occur to notify the Central Bank of Uruguay of certain modifications with respect to the entity and with respect to the shareholders and members of the chain of ownership. Among those modifications are the modification of the company's address, personal data of shareholders and directors, etc.

# Uruguay
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
## Inventory valuation
Replacement cost is permitted for tax purposes, as well as the first in first out (FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), or average cost methods, irrespective of the inventory valuation method used for accounting purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are treated as ordinary income for CIT purposes.
As a general rule, capital gains are calculated as the sales price minus the fiscal cost (usually acquisition cost updated by certain inflationary indexes) of goods being sold. In certain cases, not all the fiscal cost may be deductible, depending on the application or not of the compulsory proportional deduction _mentioned previously in the section_.
Furthermore, for certain capital gains, there are special ways of determining the taxable income (e.g. based on notional income).
Capital gains derived from the transfer of titles/shares issued by Uruguayan entities are subject to a 12% tax rate, applicable to a notional 20% of the transfer price (or 20% of market value of the titles transferred if there is no price). For titles quoted in a Uruguayan stock exchange, the 'real method' can be applied.
## Dividend income
Dividends received from local subsidiaries are exempt.
The general rule is that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries are out of the scope of this tax since they are considered foreign-sourced, thus non-taxable, income.
However, for fiscal years ended as of 31 December 2023, dividends will be taxed by CIT to the extent that they are obtained by an entity that is part of a multinational group and ’substance‘ requirements, as defined in the rules, are not met in Uruguay _(see Foreign-source income below for more information on this matter)_.
## Interest income
Uruguayan-sourced interest income, derived by resident companies in the country, is subject to CIT under the general regime (i.e. taxed at 25%).
## Royalty income
Uruguayan-sourced royalty income, obtained by resident companies in the country, is subject to CIT under the general regime (i.e. taxed at 25%).
## Foreign-source income
CIT payers in Uruguay are only subject to tax on income from Uruguayan sources under the territorial system of taxation. Hence, foreign-source income is not subject to tax. Income derived from activities performed, assets located, or rights utilised outside Uruguay, regardless of the nationality, domicile, or residence of the parties participating in the transactions and the place where the transaction agreements are subscribed, is not subject to CIT.
The following paragraphs address exceptions to this principle.
When a CIT payer obtains income as a consequence of rendering technical services outside the limits of Uruguayan territory to another CIT payer and such technical services are used by the recipient to obtain its income subject to CIT, the income obtained by the company rendering the services will be subject to CIT, even when foreign sourced. Technical services are those rendered in the fields of management, technical administration, or advice of any kind.
The following will also be considered Uruguayan-source income:
  * Advertising services rendered from outside Uruguay to CIT payers.
  * Mediation, leasing, use, transfer of use, or transfer of federate rights, image rights, and similar of athletes registered in resident sports entities, regardless of the registration period or permanence in Uruguay.


Additionally, based on amendments to CIT provisions (December 2022), the following items of foreign-source income will be taxed by CIT to the extent that they are obtained by an entity that is part of a multinational group and if ’substance‘ requirements, as defined in the rules, are not met in Uruguay:
  * Income derived from intellectual property (IP) rights, relating to patents and registered software, disposed of or used economically abroad. 
  * Income stemming from real estate, capital yields, dividends, interest, other royalties, other income from movable capital, capital gains from the transfer of ownership of assets passible of generating the aforementioned income, and every other equity increase derived from those assets, when obtained by a non-qualified entity. For trademarks, proceeds from holding them or from their disposal will be deemed Uruguayan sourced in all cases.


The concept of a multinational group is defined by the regulations as a group of two or more related entities, resident in different jurisdictions, including the parent company and its PEs.
On the other hand, the rules establish that the relationship will exist when the entity is a member of a multinational group, which occurs when any of the following conditions is verified:
  1. The entity is included in the consolidated financial statements of the group for filing purposes in accordance with the accounting principles generally applied in the jurisdiction of the ultimate controlling entity of the group or would have been included if the entity were required to prepare such statements, or should have been included in them if the equity interests in such entity were traded in a public securities market.
  2. If the inclusion hypotheses set forth in paragraph (i) above are met, but it is excluded from the consolidated financial statements of the group solely for reasons of size or relevance.


A qualified entity is such that has an adequate economic substance during the fiscal year. For not being subject to CIT, the condition of qualified entity has to be met with respect to each of the assets generating the items of income stemming from certain assets located outside Uruguay, and during the entire holding period. For such purposes, it will be considered that there is an adequate economic substance for those items of income obtained by an entity that complies with the following conditions simultaneously:
  1. It employs human resources commensurate in number, qualification, and remuneration to manage the investment assets, and has adequate facilities for the development of this activity in the national territory.
  2. It makes the necessary strategic decisions and bears the risks in the national territory.
  3. It incurs the appropriate expenses and costs in relation to the acquisition, holding, or disposal of the relevant investments.


In relation to the condition of qualified entity in a fiscal year, taxpayers must file an annual affidavit with the Uruguayan Tax Office stating the mentioned points.
For purposes of requirements mentioned in (i) and (ii), even when outsourced, it shall be understood that the entity has adequate economic substance when the activity is developed through qualified human resources provided by those third parties in the national territory, and to the extent that there is adequate supervision and control in Uruguay by the entity. 
Requirements referred to in (ii) and (iii) do not apply for entities whose core business is holding participations in other entities or in real estate.
## Income adjustment for inflation
An income adjustment for inflation applies for the determination of income. It is calculated by multiplying the variation in the consumer price index (CPI) for the financial year by the difference between:
  1. total assets at the beginning of the year (excluding fixed assets) and
  2. total liabilities at the beginning of the year.


Under an inflation scenario, if (i) is higher than (ii), then an inflation loss adjustment is deducted from gross income. If (ii) is higher than (i), then an inflation gain adjustment is added.
Tax regulations disallow Uruguayan taxpayers to calculate tax inflation adjustment in their CIT return if inflation is below 100% (variation of the CPI accumulated in the 36 months prior to the close of the fiscal year end). To the extent that inflation has not got to those levels, this adjustment is not applicable in practice.


# Uruguay
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 September 2024
Net income derived from business activities conducted in Uruguay, obtained by legal entities resident in Uruguay and non-residents operating through a permanent establishment (PE) in Uruguay, is taxed at a CIT rate of 25% under the source principle (i.e. the territorial system of taxation). Accordingly, Uruguay taxes only income that is derived from activities conducted within its borders, income generated from property located in Uruguayan territory, or income derived from the economic use of rights within its territory (_see Foreign income in the_ _section for an exception to this principle_).
In order to determine the net taxable income, all accrued expenses that are necessary for the generation of Uruguayan-source income and that are duly documented are allowed as deductions. Additionally, taxpayers are able to deduct expenses from their gross income if such expenses are subject to taxation (either foreign or local taxation) in the hands of their counterpart. A compulsory proportional deduction must be calculated when the taxation in the hands of their counterpart is lower than 25% (CIT rate).
A 12% withholding tax (WHT) is imposed on Uruguayan-sourced income obtained by non-residents, except in cases where the income is obtained through the operations of a PE in Uruguay (_see the_ _section for more information_).
## Trading companies
Uruguayan corporations that sell and buy foreign goods and/or services from Uruguay (which are not physically introduced to the country, in the case of goods; or which are not economically used in Uruguay, in the case of services) may determine the net Uruguayan-source income on a notional basis of 3% of the gross margin (difference between the selling price and the purchase price). This gross margin has to be compliant with transfer pricing rules (in line with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] guidelines). The applicable effective CIT rate is 0.75% (25% x 3%).
## Local income taxes
No taxes on corporate income may be levied by municipal authorities or other local governments.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Uruguayan VAT is levied at a general rate of 22% on the provision of services and on the circulation of goods within the limits of the Uruguayan territory. The import of goods and value-added in regard to the construction of immovable assets are also within the scope of this tax.
The following items (among others) are either subject to a reduced 10% VAT rate or exempt from VAT entirely.
Items subject to the 10% VAT rate:
  * Food and medicines.
  * Hotel services.
  * Health services.
  * The first sale of immovable assets.


Items exempt from VAT:
  * Milk.
  * Books.
  * Magazines.
  * Agricultural machinery.
  * Certain bank services.
  * Accessories.


Exports are zero rated for VAT purposes. VAT on purchases of the exporters can be recovered in the form of credit certificates that can be (i) used to pay other taxes, (ii) used to pay social security contributions, or (iii) endorsed to suppliers who can pay their own national taxes or their own social security contributions.
According to Law Nbr. 19,210 of financial inclusion and electronic payment means and its regulations, the VAT rate has been reduced for the disposal of goods and services made to final consumers, provided that payment is made through debit cards or electronic money instruments. The current rate reduction results in a VAT rate of 20%. Likewise, other VAT reductions have been implemented for specific cases, provided debit cards or electronic payment methods are used.
VAT requires monthly payments and may require monthly or annual tax returns, depending on the qualification of the taxpayer.
## Customs duties
  * Consular Duty: The rate is 3% for products with Chile and Mercosur origin and 5% for products originated in the rest of the world. The rate applicable to automobiles is 5%, regardless of their origin. Products originated in Mexico, as well as products introduced to Uruguay in the framework of the temporary admission regime, crude oil and certain petroleum-derived liquid fuels, and capital goods with a destination in the industrial, agricultural, and fisheries sectors, are exempt from the Consular Duty.
  * Customs Services Duty: 0.2%, with a maximum of USD 50.
  * Customs Extraordinary Duty: A scale flat duty, with a limit of USD 600.
  * Global Customs Duty (GCD): Depends on the origin of goods. If the products are originated in a Mercosur member country or in a country with a Free Trade Agreement with Uruguay/Mercosur, the GDC is generally zero (certain exceptions apply). Otherwise, the GDC varies depending on the type of product, with a maximum rate of 35%. For goods classified as 'fixed assets' and 'information and telecommunication goods', there is a special regime that, in general terms, foresees null/lower GCD.
  * All imports and exports duties are applied on the ‘customs value’ (in general, in imports it is considered as cost, insurance, and freight [CIF] and in exports as free on board [FOB]).
  * On imports, VAT is also applicable according to the following detail: 
    * Goods subject to the general VAT rate (22%): 
      * Import VAT at the rate of 22%.
      * Advanced payment import VAT at a rate of 10%.
    * Goods subject to the reduced VAT rate (10%): 
      * Import VAT at the rate of 10%.
      * Advanced payment import VAT at a rate of 3%.
    * The tax base of VAT on imports is the customs value plus the customs duties (GCD).
  * Additionally, some goods are also subject to an ‘advanced payment import on account of CIT’ at a rate of 4% or 15%, depending on the type of good, which can be deducted from the amount of CIT for the fiscal year.


## Mercosur: Origin of goods in free zones 
On 21 July 2019, Decision 33/15 issued by the Common Market Council (CMC) of the Mercosur (South American Customs Market) entered into force. This Decision establishes that all goods originated in a member state of the Mercosur, or a third country with the same origin rules (on the basis of an agreement with the Mercosur), shall not lose their origin nature when they pass through a special customs zone, an export processing zone, or a free zone, provided such zones are under customs control.
In order to enjoy the benefits of Mercosur origin, neither the tariff classification of the goods nor their origin nature verified by means of the Certificate with which they enter such zones shall be altered. It should be borne in mind that if the origin nature wants to be maintained, there shall be carried out only operations to ensure the trade, conservation, division into lots or volumes, and operations bearing similar purposes.
This applies when the final destination of the goods is any of the full Mercosur member countries.
## Export duties
Exports are not subject to any taxes, and there are almost no prohibitions regarding the type of goods to be exported. On the contrary, several instruments are offered to promote exports, such as the reimbursement of taxes. _For VAT on exports, please see VAT above_.
The exporter may also recover internal taxes that are added to the cost of the products exported. The amount to be reimbursed is a percentage of the export customs value. Additionally, temporary admission is a regime that consists of the import of raw materials, pieces, motors, package material, and other industrial input, free of customs duties or taxes. 
## Excise tax (IMESI)
In general, excise tax applies on the first transaction effected in the domestic market by manufacturers or importers of goods. Exports are not taxable.
Excise tax rates vary for each item, and they are generally fixed by the government within maximum parameters established by law.
Goods subject to the highest rates are alcoholic beverages (from 20.20% to 80%, depending on the alcohol degree), tobacco (from 28% to 70%), lubricants (from 5% to 35%), and gasoline, fuel, and other petroleum products (from 5% to 133%).
This tax requires monthly payments and/or tax returns.
## Net wealth tax (NWT)
All types of legal entities and business enterprise owners are subject to an annual NWT at a rate of 1.5% (3% in case of LNTJ) on the value of net assets. This tax also follows the source principle, whereby only assets located or economically used in Uruguay are taxable. Taxpayers may deduct from the NWT the CIT of the same fiscal year; however, the deduction is currently capped at 1% of the NWT.
The deduction of liabilities from the amount of taxable assets to determine the NWT basis is limited to: (i) the average of debts with local financial institutions, (ii) debts with suppliers of goods (except imports) and services, (iii) taxes not yet due, (iv) debts with governments, international credit offices of which Uruguay is a member and with foreign state financial institutions that lend funds for long-term productive projects, and (v) debts documented in debentures and obligations if their emission is done in a public offering and such papers are quoted in a stock exchange.
## Property taxes
Regarding taxes of relevance for those doing business in Uruguay, _please see Net wealth tax (NWT) above_.
There are additional property taxes of less significance, levied by Municipal authorities (e.g. _Contribución Inmobiliaria_) and by National authorities (e.g. Primary School Tax _[Impuesto de Primaria]_).
Note that the Primary School Tax levied on rural assets has been re-established.
## Tax on real estate transfer (ITP)
ITP applies to the transfer of immovable assets. Transfer is defined in a wide sense, as a sale, a cession of the right to use, a transfer of inheritance rights, etc.
Both parties to the transfer contract are subject to this tax at a rate of 2% on the property’s tax value (according to a National Register, a value generally lower than market value). When the property is transferred without payment, the beneficiary pays tax at a rate of 4% on the property tax valuation, except in instances where the property is transferred to direct heirs or legatees, who pay this tax at a rate of 3%.
The transmissions of taxable assets that take place as a result of the replacement or removal of trustees is excluded from this tax.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp taxes are not applicable in Uruguay.
## Tax of control of corporations (ICOSA)
Upon the set-up of a corporation, ICOSA is payable at a 1.5% rate on a notional basis amount, which is determined annually by the authorities. For fiscal year 2024, the amount of this tax (lump sum) is 50,963 Uruguayan pesos (UYU).
This tax is also due annually for corporations at the end of each fiscal year, at a rate of 0.75% on said notional amount. Even though this tax can be deducted from the NWT, the excess cannot be refunded, acting as a minimum NWT payment. For fiscal year 2024, the amount of this tax (lump sum) is UYU 25,481.
## Payroll taxes
Individual income taxes applicable on employees’ remunerations must be withheld by the employer.
## Social security contributions
The Uruguayan Social Security regime states that hiring personnel under a dependency relationship implicates the obligation (both for employer and employee) of making contributions over the compensations that constitute the taxable basis.
Taxable basis consists of all earning that in a regular and permanent basis, in cash or kind, susceptible to pecuniary appreciation, is perceived by the dependant personnel, in concept of remuneration and product of its personal activity, in the frame of the working relationship. As a general rule, any compensation originated in activities carried out in Uruguay is subject to social security contributions.
The social security contribution rates are applicable on gross remunerations, according to the following percentages:
Contribution | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%)  
---|---|---  
Retirement contributions (1) | 7.5 | 15  
Health insurance | 5 | 3/4.5/5/6/6.5/8 (2)  
Labour restructuring fund  | 0.1 | 0.1  
Labour Credit Guarantee Fund  | 0.025 | 0  
Total social security contributions | 12.625 | 18.1 to 23.1  
Notes
  1. Both employer and employee retirement contributions rates are applicable, up to the monthly amount of UYU 256,821 (until 31 December 2024); the exceeding amount will be exempt.
  2. Varies depending on whether the employee is married and whether they have children.
