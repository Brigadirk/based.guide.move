## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Austria has entered into DTTs with all major trading countries. Some of the treaties provide for elimination or partial elimination of double taxation by foreign tax credit (e.g. Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, United States). Under the majority of treaties, however, double taxation is avoided or partially avoided by an exemption-with-saving clause as to progression. As an exception to the rule, dividends and interest are usually fully taxable with a foreign tax credit.
## Tax treaties

  2. Until a new treaty is established, the treaty with Czechoslovakia remains applicable.
  3. Suspended as per 7 December 2023.


### Social security (totalisation) agreements
Austria has entered into agreements on social security with its major trading partners, under which, in most cases, it is possible for expatriates on temporary secondment from non-EU countries to apply for exemption from Austrian social security contributions for a certain period of time, provided home country social insurance continues. The Austrian social security authorities will ask for a home country certificate of coverage. For EU citizens, different rules apply (form A1).
Despite the countries where the EU-Directive 883/2004 is applicable (EU, European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland), Austria has agreed to totalisation agreements with the following countries:
Albania | Korea (South) | Tunisia  
---|---|---  
Australia | Kosovo (1) | Turkey  
Bosnia and Herzegovina | Moldova | United Kingdom (2)  
Canada (including Quebec) | Montenegro | United States

## Inflation adjustment: Cold progression/bracket creep
From 1 January 2023 on, the effect of the cold progression should be counteracted as far as possible.
For this reason, each year many tax-relevant tax brackets, standard deductions, fixed payments, etc. will be valorised on an annual basis. The increase of the corresponding amounts is based on the inflation for the period June to May of the current year (arithmetic average).
2/3 of the calculated percentage will be used to increase the corresponding values as per 1 January of the next following year. The amounts that will be amended have to be announce via an ordinance by 31 August of the current year for the following year.
The tax rates will not be amended, only the applicable tax brackets.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
All individuals resident in Austria are subject to Austrian income tax on their worldwide income, including income from trade or business, profession, employment, investments, and property. Non-residents are taxed on income from certain sources in Austria only. Non-residents are subject to income tax on Austrian-source income at normal rates (including a fictitious income increase of 10,888 euros [EUR]).
## Personal income tax rates
Income (EUR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
13,308 and below | 0  
13,308 to 21,617 | 20  
21,617 to 35,836 | 30  
35,836 to 69,166 | 40  
69,166 to 103,072 | 48  
103,072 to 1,000,000 | 50  
above 1,000,000 | 55  
## Payroll withholding tax (WHT) examples
Assuming Austrian social security applies, wage tax and social security contributions on current salary are withheld as follows:
2025 (EUR)  
---  
Annual taxable salary | Monthly salary (paid 14 times) | Pre-tax monthly social security withholding | Monthly wage tax withholding  
29,000 | 2,071.43 | 313.20 | 87.06  
36,000 | 2,571.43 | 464.66 | 186.21  
54,000 | 3,857.14 | 696.99 | 518.61  
76,000 | 5,428.57 | 980.94 | 1,033.60  
  * Individuals for whom employment income subject to wage tax is the only source of income are not obligated to file income tax returns. However, such individuals may obtain a partial refund of taxes by filing an income tax return where they have incurred deductible business or special expenses or did not have a constant salary for 12 months.
  * A sole earner credit can be applied as follows: If a married couple with a single income has one child and is entitled to the family allowance for more than six months, the monthly reduction amount is EUR 50.08, with two children it is by EUR 67.75, it increases for the third and each further child by EUR 22.33. For married couples without children, the sole earner credit is not applicable.
  * Tax rates applicable to monthly salaries are based on the above-listed income tax rates.
  * The 13th- and 14th-month salaries (‘special payments’) are subject to social security deductions (_see Social security contributions in the_ _section for more information_). The first EUR 620 is tax exempt; from the remaining amount, tax is withheld at a graduated rate between 6% and 55% (_see Employment income in the_ _section for more information_).


## Local income taxes
No local income taxes are payable in Austria.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year for individuals is always the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns can be filed with the local tax office after the end of each calendar year. Separate returns are required for the period in which an individual is resident and for the period in which an individual is non-resident (but with income subject to Austrian taxation).
Joint filing of income tax returns (e.g. for spouses, family members) is not permitted, each individual has to file their own annual tax return. Tax returns have to be filed by April 30 of the following year (paper form) or end of June of the following year (electronic filing). In case the taxpayer has only salary income where wage tax has already been withheld, a tax return can be filed within five years after the end of the tax year.
In case of filing a tax return, an annual amount of EUR 10,888 is added to a non-resident's annual income.
## Payment of tax
In general, income tax is withheld from salaries/wages, interest, and dividends (_see Dividend income in the section for more information_). Income tax on other types of income is payable quarterly, with an annual return filing requirement.
The final tax will be assessed by an assessment note and is payable within about one month after tax assessment.
From 1 October of the following year until the date of tax assessment, interest is payable on the final tax amount due (or will be paid by the tax office in case of tax refund). Interest can be prevented if a sufficient down payment is made by 30 September. The interest rate is the basic interest rate of the ECB plus 2%.
## Tax audit process
The tax office checks the information provided (request of additional documents or information possible) and has to issue a tax assessment note within six months after filing.
Until the statute of limitations passes (_see below_), additional checks by the tax office are possible. Tax audits usually cover the prior three years for which tax assessment notes were issued.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for excise taxes is three years, for other taxes five years. In case of tax fraud, the period is ten years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Currently, the tax office shows special attention to expenses for double household, family home trips, medical costs as extraordinary expenses and use of (company) cars with foreign plates in Austria.


# Austria
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Expenses incurred in ‘acquiring, securing, and maintaining’ income are deductible from the taxable income of the particular source of income concerned. All employees are entitled to a standard allowance of EUR 132. Expenses in excess of this amount will be allowed if supported by receipts (e.g. office in home, continuing education).
Employee portions of mandatory contributions to Austrian and/or foreign social security are tax deductible.
In computing income from employment, expenses related to the production and collection of income is generally tax deductible. These expenses include the following:
  * Membership fees to certain organisations (e.g. Chamber of Labour, workers council).
  * Compulsory social and pension insurance contributions.
  * Commuting expenses between residence and place of work where a standard deduction can be claimed per month; the deductible amount depends on the distance and the possibility of using public transport.
  * Work equipment and special work clothes.
  * Business related travel expenses and per diems.
  * Technical literature.
  * Training costs.


## Personal deductions
### Special expenses
Church tax is deductible up to EUR 600, and charitable contributions to certain institutions are deductible up to 10% of the current year’s taxable income. Austrian tax adviser fees are fully deductible.
### Extraordinary expenses
Individuals who incur extraordinary expenses can obtain some tax relief. This relief applies to resident individuals who are subject to unlimited tax liability who incur unavoidable expenses (e.g. funeral costs, medical expenses for special treatments not reimbursed by health insurance). Depending on income and family status, the taxpayer may be able to deduct an amount that exceeds a certain percentage of one's income. The retention rates are as follows:
Annual income (EUR) | Retention rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 7,300 | 6  
7,300 | 14,600 | 8  
14,600 | 36,400 | 10  
36,400 | 12  
The percentage is reduced by 1% for an individual:
  * who is eligible for a sole earner tax credit or a single parent tax credit, or
  * who is not eligible for a sole earner or a single parent tax credit but the individual is married more than six months during the calendar year or living more than six months in a registered partnership and is not permanently separated from one's married/registered partner whose income is less than EUR 7,284 per year,
  * as well as for every additional child if the taxpayer receives for more than six months the child tax-free amount or the alimony tax credit.


Certain expenses (e.g. damage due to disaster) are generally fully tax deductible.
### Family bonus plus
The family bonus plus is a tax credit, which reduces the amount of tax paid. The annual tax credit of EUR 2,000 per child can be claimed for children up to the age of 18 years, who live in Austria, and are entitled to family allowance. If both parents claim the family bonus plus, both taxpayers are entitled to 50% of the tax-free amount (EUR 1,000 _per annum_ for each taxpayer).
For children between 19 and 24 (in some cases until 25), the family bonus plus can be granted up to an amount of EUR 700 _per annum_.
## Allowances
Generally, personal allowances take the form of tax credits, i.e. deductions from tax payable. By contrast, family allowances are paid to the taxpayer in cash. _See the section for more information_.
## Losses
Business losses or rental losses can be offset with other categories of income. Business losses can be forwarded in following years in case assessed by adequate and orderly accounting.
Rental losses cannot be carried forward.
_For a discussion of capital losses, see Capital gains in the section_.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Special ruling for expatriates
The consideration of flat-rate professional expenses is possible in the ongoing payroll accounting or in the annual income tax return.
You will find the provision in detail below:
### How is an expatriate defined?
An expatriate is an employee:
  * of a foreign company:
    * who works for a maximum of five years in Austria, and
    * who has an employment contract with an Austrian employer (group company or domestic business premises)
  * who has not had a place of residence in Austria in the last ten years
  * who has retained one's place of residence abroad, and
  * on whose income Austria has a right of taxation.


All these persons are entitled to a flat-rate professional expenses allowance of 20% of the calculation basis.
### How is the calculation basis determined?
The calculation basis results from the gross remuneration:
  * less special payments within the sixth month of the year, and
  * less tax-free remuneration.


The annual maximum amount is EUR 10,000; the professional expenses can be taken into account without verification. This covers additional expenses in connection with the assignment in Austria (e.g. dual household, trips home to see family).
If the employee does not work in Austria for the whole year, the (maximum) amount is to be calculated on a _pro rata_ basis. Months commenced are treated as full months.
### The professional expenses exceed the flat rate - what needs to be done?
If the expatriate wishes to claim professional expenses that exceed the flat rate of EUR 10,000 (e.g. for the apartment in Austria or for trips home to visit family), these can be claimed in one's tax declaration. In turn, pursuant to the general regulations, a verification of individual receipts is necessary.
Please note that cost reimbursements pursuant to Section 26 of the Income Tax Act (_Einkommensteuergesetz_ or EStG) (e.g. remuneration for relocation) reduce the flat rate for professional expenses. However, travel reimbursements pursuant to Section 26 Clause 4 of the Income Tax Act (EStG) do not reduce the flat-rate allowance.
### Time aspect?
In contrast to the flat-rate allowances for professional expenses for other professional groups, the flat rate for expatriates can already be taken into account by the employer directly in the monthly payroll accounting; if this is not the case, the allowance can be claimed in the employee's tax declaration.
If the flat-rate allowance for professional expenses is taken into consideration in the monthly payroll accounting, this is to be listed in wage slip L16 under "allowance pursuant to Section 63 of the Income Tax Act (EStG)". A separate notice of the allowance is not necessary.
Additional special expenditures, business expenses, and extraordinary financial burdens can be considered in the annual tax return.
In case of consideration during payroll, the employer must forward a written notification to the appropriate tax office at the beginning of the assignment and thereafter at the beginning of every calendar year, stating the names of the employees for whom the beneficial tax treatment is claimed, and must inform the tax authorities of their personal data, including addresses in Austria and in the foreign country.
## Work and residence permit
According to the current Austrian legal regulations, individuals who wish to take up employment in Austria basically need a work permit and residence permit unless they are citizens of a country that is a member of the European Union, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland. Special provisions apply for British citizens as of 1 January 2021 (_please see below_). 
Nevertheless, EU/EEA and Swiss nationals must apply for a registration certificate (_EU-Anmeldebescheinigung_) at the competent immigration authority within four months of arrival if they intend to stay longer than three months in Austria. The registration certificate is only qualified as a kind of registration requirement and not as a permit as such.
In case of employing third-country nationals (Non-EU/EEA or Swiss nationals) in Austria, the employer or the individual generally must apply for a permit at the local immigration authority or the Austrian Consulate abroad. As of 1 October 2017, new regulations regarding Intra-Corporate Transferees (ICT), introduced by EU law, are in force. This combined work and residence permit is designed for highly skilled employees (so-called ‘executive employees’, ‘specialists', or ‘trainees’; trainees must hold a university degree). They must be transferred from an undertaking established outside the territory of an EU member state to an entity belonging to the undertaking or to the same group of undertakings that is established in Austria (ICT). The permit is issued for one year and is eligible for extension for up to three years in total with regard to executive employees or specialists. Trainees are not eligible for extension.
Furthermore, depending on the individual's professional experience and educational background, other immigration routes may be applicable, such as the Red-White-Red Card or the Blue Card-EU, which are combined work and residence permits for local hires only.
Note that only upon receipt of a combined work and residence permit may a third-country national legally start working in Austria.
Family members (spouses over 21 years, children younger than 18 years) of ICT permit holders can apply for a residence permit ‘Family Member (with ICT)’, family members of Red-White-Red Card or Blue Card-EU holders can apply for the Red-White-Red Card plus.
Also introduced by the legislator as of 1 October 2017, for third-country nationals who hold a valid work and residence permit from an EEA country, a so-called ‘Personal Lease Confirmation – EU’ (EU-_Überlassungsbestätigung_) can be issued (by the local labour authority) for temporary employment in Austria.
As far as regulations for British nationals post Brexit are concerned, the following regulations apply from the perspective of Austrian immigration law as of 1 January 2021:
British nationals who have exercised their right of residence in Austria before the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 or who have exercised employment as cross-border commuters in accordance with EU law and who continue to reside there or work as cross-border commuters thereafter will continue to have unrestricted access to the Austrian labour market on the basis of the withdrawal agreement.
British nationals who wish to take up long-term employment in Austria from 1 January 2021 will not be granted such special status under the Withdrawal Agreement. Since the Trade and Cooperation Agreement of 24 December 2020 does not provide for any special regulations either, the same regulations that apply to other newly arriving third-country nationals therefore apply to these individuals. British nationals who plan to work or settle in Austria for more than six months must therefore apply for a residence permit under the Settlement and Residence Act (such as a Red-White-Red Card for highly qualified key workers).
However, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement contains provisions on short-term business trips, intra-corporate transferees, contract service providers, and freelancers. An individual assessment of each case is required.
Furthermore, the agreement contains a clause on short-stay visas (stay of 90 days within a period of 180 days). In this clause, the European Union and the United Kingdom have agreed that short stays in the European Union or the United Kingdom will continue to be exempt from visa requirements.

# Austria
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment income
Income from employment includes all benefits in cash or in kind received by an individual from an employer and from third parties. Benefits in kind are valued according to specific rules, with some cases of global allocations (mainly cars). Company-provided housing might be valued at 75% of the actual gross rent paid by the company; reimbursement for privately paid housing is fully taxable. Certain minor benefits in kind (e.g. the granting of company stock up to an annual limit of EUR 3,000 per employee) or employee profit sharing (up to an annual limit of EUR 3,000 per employee) are tax exempt (when the legally given conditions will be fulfilled).
Reimbursement of an employee's actual relocation costs (due to a transfer or group internal transfer, not when a new job with a new employer will be started; the employee must give up one's residence) is tax-exempt; lump sum relocation allowances are tax-exempt within certain limits (due to a transfer or group internal transfer, not when a new job with a new employer will be started; the employee must give up one's residence). Reimbursement of tax costs is fully taxable.
Bonus payments (e.g. 13th- and 14th-month salaries, i.e. vacation and Christmas pay) up to an annual amount equal to two average monthly salaries are taxed as follows:
Other remuneration (EUR) | Wage tax (%)  
---|---  
for the first 620 | 0  
for the next 24,380 | 6  
for the next 25,000 | 27  
for the next 33,333 | 35.75  
above 83,333 | regular tax rate, typically 50%  
## Equity compensation
Special rules apply to employee share schemes granted to all employees or to certain groups of employees. The acquisition of shares of an employee (from the employer or a group company) either at a favourable purchase price or free of charge is considered tax-free up to an amount of EUR 3,000 per calendar year (for all equity plans together). Amounts exceeding EUR 3,000 are taxed at the progressive tax rate. Generally, the shares have to be deposited with a European Community (EC) bank, an Austrian branch of a foreign bank, or a trustee (may be located abroad). A transfer of shares within five years after acquisition is taxable if the employment contract is still in force (the originally tax free amount has to be taxed). The employee has to prove by 31 March of each year that the shares have not been sold. Otherwise, the originally tax free amount is taxable.
## Employee profit sharing
Special rules apply to employee profit sharing schemes granted to all employees or to certain groups of employees. The payment of a bonus is considered tax-free up to an amount of EUR 3,000 per calendar year. Amounts exceeding EUR 3,000 are taxed at the progressive tax rate. The bonus is linked with and limited by the profit of the company.
## Business income
Taxable profit is the total income realised from carrying on business activities, whatever the nature of the income or business.
As a general rule, the taxable profit of a small business (up to a turnover of EUR 700,000) and special freelance professionals (e.g. lawyers, tax advisors, artists, doctors) is determined on a cash basis. For a larger business, the profit is calculated on an accrual basis of accounting.
## **Capital income**
Capital income encompasses, _inter alia_ , interest income, dividends, and capital gains, as well as income from investment funds.
### Interest income
Interest income from (publicly placed) interest-bearing securities is subject to tax at 27.5%, whereas interest income from bank deposits/savings is taxed at a rate of 25% (interest from privately placed securities and private loans is taxed at the progressive income tax rate). With this WHT deduction by the Austrian bank, the income tax in general is deemed to be satisfied (final or definitive taxation).
Losses (negative capital income) cannot be offset against positive interest from bank accounts/deposits but can be offset against coupon interest from debt securities acquired after 30 March 2012.
Interest income from securities in foreign deposit accounts that is not subject to the WHT deduction must be included in the income tax return and is taxed at a 27.5% special tax rate.
If the individual’s average tax rate is less than 27.5%, then, upon assessment application, a reduction to the lower average tax rate is possible where all definitively taxable income, as well as income subject to the special tax rate, must be included.
### Dividend income
Domestic earnings from dividends are definitively taxed for income tax purposes with the 27.5% WHT deduction by the corporation distributing the dividend.
Foreign dividend earnings paid to a domestic deposit account are also subject to final taxation through the 27.5% WHT deduction. In this case, however, banks are only liable for WHT insofar as they know the nature of the capital income.
Dividend income paid to foreign deposit accounts must be included in the tax return. Such income is subject to the special 27.5% tax rate.
If the investor applies for assessment of the capital income, dividend income is subject to the average tax rate. Regardless of a double taxation treaty (DTT) with the corresponding source country, foreign paid taxes on foreign dividends can be credited up to maximum of 15% (by the Austrian depositary bank).
Where disposal profits or income from capital assets are derived from abroad, then the corresponding double taxation convention must be taken into account.
### Capital gains
Under the Austrian capital gains regulations effective since 1 April 2012, capital gains resulting from sales of shares (including qualifying participation's), securities, or other financial assets (e.g. securitised derivatives, certificates) are subject to 27.5% income tax as a final tax if the assets have been acquired after 31 December 2010 (or 30 March 2012 for interest-bearing securities and securitised derivatives). Realised capital gains from the sale of securities or other financial assets bought before the above mentioned date ('grandfathered' assets) are generally tax free. The grandfathering provisions do not apply to holdings where the relevant person owned at least 1% of the total issued capital of a company at any time within the five-year period preceding 1 April 2012.
The capital gain taxation provides for calculation of the realised capital gains by deducting the acquisition costs from the disposal proceeds (each inclusive of accrued interest, where applicable, but excluding transaction charges and other costs for individuals). Acquisition costs for securities with the same security identification number are derived from a moving average of the actual costs of acquisitions.
Realised capital losses on assets may be offset against capital income and gains earned within the same calendar year. The following exceptions apply:
  * Capital losses and losses from derivatives cannot be offset against interest earned on interest bearing securities that were acquired before 1 April 2012.
  * Income and gains/losses subject to tax at 27.5% cannot be offset against income and gains/losses that are not subject to tax at 27.5%.
  * Interest expenses (interest paid on a loan or overdraft) cannot be offset against positive interest.
  * Capital losses arising from the disposal of 'grandfathered' assets are not taxable in Austria and cannot be offset against gains realised elsewhere.
  * For private investors, a loss carryforward is not possible. If the investments are held as business assets, one half of the excess amount can be carried forward.


### Investment funds
The basic principle of taxation of both Austrian and foreign investment funds is transparency (if foreign investment funds comply with the Austrian reporting requirements, the same taxation rules are applicable as for domestic funds).
Taxable income from investment funds consists of both ordinary income (e.g. dividends and interest income) and income from capital gains realised at the fund level. Both types of income may be distributed or accumulated within the investment fund. Distributions of ordinary income and income from capital gains are taxable with 27.5% with no difference between domestic and foreign funds. The key difference in treatment depends on whether the foreign investment fund is registered as a reporting fund or not registered and therefore a non-reporting fund.
Capital gains realised by the fund are taxable; however, for private investors, only 60% of accumulated realised capital gains are taxable (applicable for Austrian funds and in Austria registered foreign reporting funds, but not for non-registered foreign non-reporting funds).
The accumulated income of a fund is deemed to be distributed to the fund holders and taxed accordingly. The Austrian tax figures have to be filed by an Austrian tax representative within five months after the fund’s financial year-end for domestic investment funds and within seven months after the fund’s financial year-end for foreign investment funds.
Income (distributed or accumulated) from domestic Austrian investment funds and foreign investment funds held by a private investor on a domestic deposit account is basically subject to immediate and complete final taxation with 27.5% Consequently, domestic and foreign reporting investment funds held by a private investor on a domestic deposit account do not have to be included into the annual tax return.
Non-reporting foreign investment funds will be taxed differently. The tax rates are the same, but the calculation of the taxable amounts is different. As for these investment funds, the composition of the income (interest, dividends, capital gains) is not known. The calculation of the taxable deemed distributed income (DDI) is based on a lump sum calculation rule: taxable as DDI are 90% of the growth in value during the year, but at least 10% from the value of the fund at the end of the year. The DDI calculated will be taxed at 27.5%. The taxed DDI increases the acquisition costs of the investment fund. The actual distribution and the capital gains when the shares of the fund are sold are usually available. For this reason, the actual amounts can be calculated and are taxable at the 27.5% rate.
Income from investment funds held by a private investor on a foreign deposit must be included in the investor’s annual income tax return and is taxed at a 27.5% special tax rate.
## Rental income
Rental income is subject to the individual progressive tax rates.
Rental income is the difference between the rent payments received less any deductions for expenses paid (e.g. mortgage, repairs).
In case of foreign rental income, the conditions of the applicable DTT have to be considered, and foreign rental income has to be converted into Austrian rental income, based on the Austrian tax rules.
## Exempt income
Only income mentioned in the income tax act is taxable. For this reason, heritages, gifts, earnings from gambling or bets, specific awards, finder’s fees, etc. are income tax free.

## Family allowance
A monthly tax-free cash payment for children up to age 18, or up to 24 if still in school, or handicapped (up to age 25 under certain conditions), is granted by the government upon formal request. Family allowance (_Familienbeihilfe_) in Austria is only granted if no foreign entitlement to child benefit is given.
For children living in Austria, the allowances are as follows:
  * For children below the age of three: EUR 138.40 per month.
  * For children between the ages of three and ten: EUR 148.00 per month.
  * For children between the ages of ten and 18: EUR 171.80 per month.
  * For orphans and children between the ages of 19 and 24 (25 in some cases) who are in school: EUR 200.10 per month.


Monthly increase: The total family allowance is increased for each child by:
  * EUR 8.60 per month if the family allowance is paid for at least two children
  * EUR 21.10 per month for at least three children
  * EUR 32.10 per month for at least four children
  * EUR 38.90 per month for at least five children
  * EUR 43.40 per month for at least six children, and
  * EUR 63.10 per month for each additional child.


A 13th instalment of family allowance of EUR 121.40 per child will be paid by the tax office in the month of September in each calendar year for each child between the ages of 6 and 15.
These allowances are granted even in cases where no income tax is payable.
Family allowance is paid by the tax office in cash along with the monthly child allowance of EUR 70.90 for each child.
Furthermore, a child care allowance (_Kinderbetreuungsgeld_) is granted for new-born children. An amount between EUR 17.65 and EUR 80.12 per day is paid for children who have passed the mother-child check up and depends on the length of maternity leave taken by the individual. If the mother-child check up examination is not taken, the child pay will be reduced.
One can choose between flat-rate and income-related child care allowances, whereas the income limit with a flat-rate option is EUR 18,000 per year, the income limit is EUR 8,100 per year if one chooses the income-related option.
An additional allowance for three or more children is granted (_Mehrkindzuschlag_), but only when the family allowance for children has been obtained and the household income for the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 55,000. The additional allowance amounts to EUR 24.40 per month for the third and each additional dependent child. This allowance has to be applied by filing a tax return.

## Social security contributions
Monthly rates of compulsory (pre-tax) social security contributions are shown below for pensions, sickness, unemployment, accident insurance, and certain minor contributions:
Social security categories | Employer (%) | Employee (%) | Total (%)  
---|---|---|---  
Sickness | 3.78 | 3.87 | 7.65  
Unemployment | 3.05 | 2.95 | 6.0  
Pension | 12.55 | 10.25 | 22.80  
Accident | 1.10 | 0.00 | 1.10  
Miscellaneous | 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.60  
Total | 20.98* | 18.07* | 39.05*  
* On a maximum assessment basis (gross salary) of EUR 6,450 per month for current payments and is applied for both employer and employee. Special payments receive a tax favoured treatment (employer at 20.48%, employee at 17.07%, for a total of 37.55%). The maximum assessment basis (gross) amounts to EUR 12,900 per year.
There is also a possibility that family members can be co-insured without any additional contributions. An additional insurance contribution of 3.4% from the calculation base is collected, e.g., in cases when the co-insured person (a spouse, a registered partner, or a person running the household) does not bring up a child/children living in the common household or did it for at least four years.
In addition, the employer is liable to the Family Burdens Equalisation Levy at the rate of 3.7%, the municipal tax on payroll at the rate of 3% of monthly gross salaries and wages, and a public transportation levy of EUR 2 per week per employee in the city of Vienna. In addition, a contribution to the Chamber of Commerce is levied at a rate between 0.31% and 0.40% of monthly gross salaries paid (depending on the province). Moreover, a contribution to the mandatory employee pension fund at the rate of 1.53% on monthly gross salaries is payable for employments subject to Austrian employment law.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Generally, the Austrian VAT law is based on the 6th European Union (EU) VAT Directive. Under the Austrian VAT law, companies and individuals carrying out an active business on a permanent basis are qualified as entrepreneurs for VAT purposes. As entrepreneurs, they have to charge the supply of goods or services provided to their customers with Austrian VAT at a rate of 20%. A certain limited range of goods and services (such as food, books, passenger transportation, cultural events) is taxed at the reduced rate of 10% or 13%. Certain other transactions are exempted from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions).
#### Input VAT
Entrepreneurs are entitled to deduct Austrian input VAT insofar as the input VAT does not result from goods/services purchased that are directly linked to certain VAT exempt sales (e.g. interest income, insurance premium). However, certain transactions are exempt from Austrian VAT (e.g. export transactions) without limiting the ability of the entrepreneur to deduct the related input VAT. To be entitled to deduct input VAT, the entrepreneur must obtain an invoice from one's supplier that fulfils certain formal requirements.
#### VAT filing and payment
Entrepreneurs have to file monthly or quarterly VAT returns by the 15th day of the second month following the month concerned or by the 15th day of the second month following the quarter concerned. The balance of the VAT due and the input VAT deducted has to be paid to the tax office (if VAT burden) or is refunded by the tax office (if in a net input VAT position) to the electronic tax account of the entrepreneur. A separate report has to be filed by the entrepreneur at the tax office showing the cross‑border intra EU‑transactions made.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no wealth/worth tax in Austria.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, or gift taxes in Austria.
## Property taxes
### Real property acquisition tax
The following tax is levied on the acquisition of real estate, including land and buildings, or any entitlements to build on Austrian real estate. The tax rate is generally 3.5% of the consideration paid, but the minimum of the property value. However, in case of non-remunerated acquisition (e.g. donations), the tax rate is scaled as follows:
Value of property (EUR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
0 to 250,000 | 0.5  
250,001 to 400,000 | 2.0  
400,001 and more | 3.5  
## Real estate tax
Austrian municipalities impose an annual tax on real estate. The assessment base is 0.1% to 0.2% of the assessed value of the real estate. This amount will be multiplied by the assessment rate determined by each municipality, which may range up to 500%. The annual maximum amount of the real estate tax is 1% of the assessed value. Instalments will be levied quarterly on 15 February, 15 May, 15 August, and 15 November if the real estate tax exceeds EUR 75 _per annum._
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury taxes in Austria.
Excise taxes are imposed on certain products, including certain energy products such as petroleum (approximately EUR 60 to EUR 600 per 1,000 litres), tobacco products (mixture of percentage and fixed amount per unit [kilogramme, number]), and alcoholic beverages.
Since the year 2022 a CO2-tax is payable (as per 2025 EUR 55 per ton). This tax as well increases the price for petroleum accordingly.
## Other non-income taxes
### Stamp duty
Stamp duty is imposed in connection with certain legally predefined transactions for which a written contract has been established (e.g. lease contracts, bills of exchange). The Austrian administration's understanding of a ‘written contract’ is very broad and covers not only paper contracts but also contracts concluded by electronic means (e.g. electronically signed emails).
The stamp duty is triggered upon the establishment of a legal relationship if at least one Austrian party is contractually involved or, even if a contract is concluded between non‑Austrian parties only, if the subject of the contract relates to Austria (e.g. lease contract on Austrian real estate). However, various possibilities are available for most legal transactions subject to stamp duty to structure them in a way without triggering stamp duties (e.g. setting up of contracts abroad, offer‑acceptance procedure, usage of audio‑tapes).
