# Honduras
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Honduras, strategically located in the heart of Central America, is bordered by Guatemala to the west, El Salvador to the southwest, Nicaragua to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Honduras is divided into 18 departments. While its political capital is Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula is the industrial capital due to its contribution to the country's economy. The official language of Honduras is Spanish, and the currency is the lempira (HNL).
Honduras is a distribution centre, with Puerto Cort√©s as the main seaport in Central America. The economy relies heavily on a range of exports, notably apparel, bananas, and coffee. However, it has emerging sectors in agriculture, textile, light manufacturing, sustainable tourism, and business services. The United States-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into force in 2006 and has helped foster investment in this country. The economy expects to register positive economic growth in 2025.
