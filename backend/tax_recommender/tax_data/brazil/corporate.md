## The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (STF) confirms that the ICMS (State VAT) should not be included in the taxable basis of PIS and COFINS (Federal VATs)
The STF concluded the long-awaited judgment of the motion for clarification in the process in which it was determined that the ICMS amount informed by the companies in their invoices should not be included in the taxable basis of the PIS and COFINS.
The understanding of the STF allows companies to stop including such amount of ICMS in the PIS and COFINS calculation basis as from 15 March 2017. For companies that did not file a judicial or administrative measure until 15 March 2017, the retroactive recovery of the undue amount is limited until that date.
## Brazilian Double Tax Treaties (DTTs) recently ratified
In recent years, Brazil has signed new DTTs with Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and Uruguay, all of which have already been internalised.
At the same time, continuous changes have been made to the current treaties, which had their texts revised and updated, as is the case of the treaties with Sweden, Chile, China, and Norway.
Furthermore, Brazil has also signed or ratified DTTs with Colombia, Poland, and the United Kingdom (UK). Such DTTs, however, are not yet in force.
## ICMS (State VAT) rate restrictions on operations with fuels, electrical power, and telecommunications
In November 2021, the STF decided that higher ICMS rates for operations involving electrical power and telecommunications are not in line with the selectivity nature of this tax, as adopted by the State legislators, due to the essentiality of said items in daily life (as observed in _Recurso Extraordinário_ nº 714.139).
Considering the expected financial impact to the Public Treasury of the decision above, the STF decided to modulate the effects of its decision to start only in 2024.
Nevertheless, in March 2022, the Brazilian National Congress presented Bill nº 18/2022, which aimed to change Brazilian federal legislation to consider fuels, electrical power, telecommunications, and public transportation as essential goods and services, imposing restrictions to the Brazilian States concerning the ICMS rates adopted.
Following an expedited procedure in the National Congress, in June 2022, the Bill was approved and converted into Supplementary Law nº 194/2022 with its effects starting as of the date of publication.
As a result of the changes set forth by the federal legislation mentioned above, some Brazilian States have already started to issue tax rules in order to regulate the applicable ICMS rates for these items.
## New transfer pricing rules
On 29 December 2022, the Brazilian government issued the Provisional Measure (MP) 1152/22 seeking alignment with the arm’s-length principle in accordance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The MP was amended and ratified by the Congress, a process that was concluded on 10 May 2023. Afterwards, the MP was converted into Law 14,596, published on 15 June 2023.
Law 14,596 is mostly principles-based and delegates substantial authority to regulations issued and to be issued by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office (RFB), through Normative Instructions (INs).
IN/RFB 2,161/2023, the first set of regulations to rule Law 14,596/23, provides guidance on the interpretations of the arm’s-length principle, related parties, controlled transactions, delineation of transactions, methods, and documentation (the procedures related to the filings of the reports, among other measurements and future implementation of transfer pricing return); however, it does not regulate important ’specific provisions‘ from the new law that, as per the RFB, will be addressed in future INs.
## Brazil VAT / excise reform
On December 20, 2023, the Brazilian Congress enacted the VAT reform representing a historic milestone for Brazil, beginning the long-awaited modernization of its complex and uncompetitive tax system.
The main changes were the elimination of 4 taxes (Social Security Financing Contribution - COFINS, Contribution to the Social Integration Program - PIS, State Indirect Tax - ICMS, Local Services Tax - ISS), reduction of the general IPI (Federal Tax on ManufacturedProducts) rate to zero and the creation of 3 new taxes: Federal Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS), Subnational Tax on Goods and Services (IBS) (States and Municipalities) and Federal Excise Tax (IS).
The transition period will be marked by a coexistence of two tax systems with old and new taxes collected in parallel for 7 years:
  * 2026: IBS shall have a rate of 0.1% and CBS a rate of 0.9%, whereas the amount collected shall be offset against PIS and COFINS amounts due.
  * 2027: 
    * Extinction of PIS/Cofins provided that CBS is created.
    * Reduction of IPI rate to zero, except in relation to products that have industrialization in the ZFM.
    * IS collection begins.


  * 2028: 
    * IBS will be charged at the State and Municipal rates of 0.05% each.
    * CBS rate will be reduced by 0.1%.


  * 2032: 
    * ICMS and ISS rates will be reduced in the following proportions: 9/10 in 2029; 8/10 in 2030; 7/10 in 2031; and 6/10 in 2032.
    * ICMS and ISS benefits or incentives will be reduced in these same proportions until 2032, when they shall be effectively discontinued.


  * 2033: Full adoption of the new consumption tax system.


After the transition period, the expected simplification and rationalization of the consumption tax regime is expected to be achieved, since the VAT reform:
  * unifies the municipal, the state, and two federal taxes on consumption into the same type of Value Added Tax (“VAT”), although divided into a Federal and a Subnational VAT (“dual VAT”);
  * brings transparency, with the tax burden visible to taxpayers and consumers, and taxation at destination, eliminating the so-called "fiscal war" between States, contributing to business decisions mainly driven by economic-financial rationale rather than tax advantages;
  * implements a fully non-cumulative system, eliminating tax leakages that are harmful to the competitiveness of Brazilian companies;
  * reinforces the tax relief on exports and investments through a reimbursement mechanism for accumulated credits;
  * contributes to reducing the country's tax litigation and compliance costs;
  * creates a fund to compensate companies benefiting from tax benefits related to ICMS, respecting the return on investments legitimately planned based on such incentives.


It is worth mentioning that the legislation will still be the subject of many discussions within the scope of elaboration of the Complementary Laws required for its full regulation.
## Partial adoption of Pillar 2 via Additional CSLL (QDMTT)
Provisional Measure (MP) No. 1,262/2024, which seeks to introduce a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) in Brazil's through the "Additional Social Contribution on Net Profits" (CSLL), along with Normative Instruction (IN) RFB No. 2,228/2024, which regulates the MP, have been published by the Federal Government, representing Brazil's partial and selective adoption of the Pillar 2 rules as from January 1, 2025.
Provisional Measures have the immediate force of federal laws but need to be ratified (ormodified or rejected) and "converted" into ordinary federal law by Congress within up to 120 days.
Out of the four GloBE (Global Anti-Base Erosion) rules, Brazil currently proposes to adopt only one, while it maintains its full-inclusion regime ("TBU") which applies the full domestic rate annually, without deferral, to all income earned not only by Controlled Foreign Companies (CFCs) but also partly owned subsidiaries.
If approved as currently designed, the Additional CSLL will apply as from January 1st, 2025, however its payment is to be made only by the last business day of the seventh month following the end of the fiscal year – July 2026 for the 2025, and so on.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Taxable period
For tax purposes, a company’s year-end is 31 December. A different year-end for corporate/accounting purposes is irrelevant.
## Tax returns
With few exceptions, corporate entities, including those that are foreign-controlled, must file an annual tax return consolidating the monthly results of the previous calendar year. This tax return must normally be filed by the last working day of July following the tax year ending on 31 December.
Supporting documentation must be retained for at least five years.
Please note that there are a number of other declarations/returns imposed by the RFB, for different taxes, at federal, municipal, and state levels, which make the tax administration in Brazil notably bureaucratic.
## Payment of tax
In the case of income tax, it is generally calculated monthly, and payments should generally be collected and paid by the last working day of the subsequent month. Any amounts of income tax due for the year (exceeding the payments performed) must be paid by the last working day of March of the subsequent year.
There is an option to pay the tax due at the end of each quarter in three instalments, the first one starting from the subsequent month to the end of the quarter. When income tax is calculated quarterly, the taxpayer must perform the applicable payment by the last working day of the month subsequent to the end of the quarter.
There are many other taxes applied in Brazil with different due dates established by the domestic legislation.
## Tax audit process
As all tax returns are digital (_please refer to public digital bookkeeping system [SPED] below_) , they may be selected for audit by computer, according to various criteria, including type of business, unusually large or small amounts of income or deductions, and random sampling.
No corporate entity, whether a taxpayer or not, is excused from furnishing information or explanations required by the tax authorities.
When audits are conducted on the premises of taxpayers, tax inspectors have broad powers to inspect books and documents and to request information and any data deemed necessary. This is generally disrupting and, in practice, every effort is made to expedite the conclusion of these audits.
Whenever a violation is determined during a tax audit, the inspectors must draw up an infringement notification, which starts the administrative procedure for additional tax assessments.
It should be noted that, in case of doubts regarding the correct tax procedure to be adopted in a specific situation, taxpayers are allowed to consult with the RFB. From the date of its publication, the consultation has a binding effect within the RFB, and it is able to support any claims made by different taxpayers in similar situations (even if not the consulting party themselves). Nevertheless, the tax authorities, during an inspection procedure, can verify whether the fact pattern is indeed similar or not. In other words, it is possible to apply the results of the consultation to other taxpayers with no relation to the party that originally made the consultation request; however, this will not prevent the possibility of being challenged by the local tax authorities during the process of confirming, whether or not such unrelated taxpayers are indeed in the same situation as the original consultation.
## Statute of limitations
The tax authorities may generally audit taxpayers up to five years after the close of the tax year. There is some debate about the moment this five-year period begins, depending on the type of tax considered and certain situations. Certain specific taxes and labour obligations have a longer statute of limitation period.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
It should be noted that, over the years, Brazil has applied a 'form-over-substance' approach. Nonetheless, as of 10 January 2001, Supplementary Law 104/2001 introduced a substantial modification in the Brazilian Tax Code (the so-called anti-avoidance rule). This law establishes a substance-over-form approach that, once regulated, may allow the RFB to disregard tax-driven transactions.
Although Supplementary Law 104/2001 has not yet been regulated, in our local practice we have seen that tax authorities are keen on ensuring taxpayers have economic substance in their operations (e.g. the use of special purpose entities to enable the amortisation of goodwill for tax purposes in Brazil).
## Public digital bookkeeping system (SPED)
Brazil has implemented a public system of digital bookkeeping known as SPED, which aims at gradually replacing paper copies of invoices and tax records for electronic files. SPED can be defined as an instrument that unifies the activities of reception, validation, storage, and legalisation of records and documents that are part of the commercial and tax bookkeeping of companies, through a single, computerised flow of data.
Comprised of three pillars (electronic invoice, digital fiscal bookkeeping, and digital accounting bookkeeping), the implementation of SPED requires adjustments to the relationship with tax authorities, clients, suppliers and, mainly, on the internal operational processes, which will demand an integrated action from different areas (tax, labour [eSocial], indirect tax [bloco K], accounting, information technology, supplies, production, commercial, and others). On the other hand, occasional inconsistencies from databases, as well as operational errors related to tax and accounting information to be generated, usually unknown to the companies’ administration, are subject to increased visibility and monitoring by the RFB.
It is important to bear in mind that there are many more Brazilian ancillary obligations to fulfil, based on electronic frameworks established by the relevant federal, state, and municipal authorities, which may not be comprised within the SPED environment.
The RFB provide for so-called ‘accounting tax bookkeeping’ (ECF), which replaced the Brazilian corporate income tax return (DIPJ), where Brazilian taxpayers need to inform all transactions that impact the computation bases for IRPJ and CSLL purposes. The ECF shall be transmitted on an annual basis to the SPED system up to the last working day of July of the subsequent year to the calendar year it refers.
In addition, there are also two ancillary obligations for reporting payroll taxes, contributions, and certain withholding taxes, referred to as 'eSocial' and 'EFD-Reinf'. The eSocial specifically relates to payroll taxes and contributions and started in waves in January 2018, and the launching was concluded in June 2018 for companies with gross revenues exceeding BRL 78 million (in 2016). For the other companies, it was planned to start in the second semester of 2019, but the deadlines for certain parts of the overall implementation have been postponed until early 2020. An additional group of information related to health and safety became due in 2020 and 2021.
EFD-Reinf is a spinoff of eSocial, and aside from the disclosure of certain withholding taxes information, it replaces the 'EFD-contribuições' module in relation to the social security contribution levied on gross revenue (CPRB). Companies that should lodge the eSocial should also submit the EFD-Reinf.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
A legal entity is considered resident in Brazil if it has been incorporated in Brazil, and its tax domicile is where its head office is located.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The specific term ‘permanent establishment’ is not included in the Brazilian legislation, rather there is a concept of ‘taxable presence’.
In general, a non-resident company may be treated as having a taxable presence if it operates in Brazil either through: (i) a fixed place of business or (ii) an agent who has the power to enter into contracts in Brazil in the name of or on behalf of the non-resident.


# Brazil
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is allowable on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. The annual rates provided by the RFB normally allowable are 10% for machinery, equipment, furniture, and installations; 20% for vehicles; and 4% for buildings. Accelerated depreciation is allowed for companies with a two or three working shift operation by increasing normal rates by 50% and 100%, respectively.
Depletion allowances are allowed for natural resources on a useful-life basis. Special incentive depletion allowances are granted for mining and oil & gas operations.
For Brazilian accounting purposes, companies should generally perform or obtain a useful life study for fixed assets in order to determine the acceptable depreciation rates. For tax purposes, the depreciation considered deductible for the corporate income tax computation is generally determined based on the application of the annual depreciation rate for accounting purposes over the asset’s acquisition cost. In cases where the depreciation registered in the books of the company is lower than that calculated based on the depreciation charts issued by the Brazilian Revenue Service, the difference can be excluded from the company’s taxable income calculation made under the actual profits method.
## Goodwill
Under certain requirements, goodwill paid upon the acquisition of the shares or quotas of a permanent investment may be amortised for tax purposes before realisation/impairment occurs (e.g. after a merger or a spin-off). It is important to note that the amortisation of goodwill is not permitted in Brazil for accounting purposes.
Whenever the cost of a share acquisition is higher than the net equity value of the acquired company, the acquisition cost of the investments should be segregated into:
  1. the net equity of the acquired company
  2. the fair value of the net assets, and
  3. the goodwill deriving from future profitability, which corresponds to the remaining balance from items (i) and (ii).


Upon a merger between buyer and acquired company (downstream or upstream), the amount of goodwill can be amortised for tax purposes over a period of not less than five years, provided certain conditions are complied with.
These conditions include the preparation of an independent appraisal report supporting the value referred to in (ii) above, which will need to be filed with the RFB or a summary with the Register of Deeds and Documents, and that the transaction has been carried out among unrelated parties.
Taxpayers wishing to continue to apply the previous rules for goodwill amortisation in relation to acquisitions made on or before 31 December 2014 had until 31 December 2017 to complete the merger of the target and the acquiring entity.
Amortisation of patents, trademarks, and copyrights, based on their useful life, is a deductible expense within approved limits.
## Start-up expenses
As a general rule, for tax purposes, start-up/pre-operational expenses may be deferred and amortised on the straight-line basis over a period of not less than five years, beginning the month in which the business starts operating.
For purposes of corporate income tax calculation based on the actual profits method, the following expenses shall not be computed within the period in which they are incurred: (i) start-up organisation expenses, including from the initial operation phase, when the company only partially used its equipment or its installations and (ii) expenses for expansion of industrial activities.
The expenses mentioned above shall be excluded for purposes of computation under the actual profits method, based on a minimum period of five years, as of the beginning of the regular operations.
## Research and development (R&D) expenditures
At the option of the company, R&D expenditures may be deducted when incurred or deferred until termination of the project and then amortised over a period of not less than five years.
R&D expenses may be excluded, for purposes of computation based on the actual profits method, when registered as non-current asset intangibles, during the computation period in which they were incurred. To use this benefit, the taxpayer must add to the net income, for purposes of computation based on the actual profits method, any amount previously recognised for the relevant intangible asset, through amortisation, sale, or write-off.
## Interest on net equity (INE)
Companies can pay interest (calculated on a _pro rata_ basis and up to a given rate, known as the ‘long-term interest rate’ [TJLP], which is currently set at 6.91%/year) to share/quota holders, based on the company’s net equity. Such interest, which may not exceed the higher of 50% of the annual profits or 50% of the accumulated earnings and profits, is deductible for both IRPJ and CSLL purposes and is subject to 15% IRRF at the source (or 25% if the beneficiary is located in a tax haven jurisdiction). Whenever the beneficiary is a legal entity subject to normal income tax in Brazil, the tax withheld at the source may be taken by the recipient as a tax credit. If the beneficiary is a Brazilian resident individual, such interest will not become subject to any further taxation.
## Interest and other payments to entities in a tax haven or under a privileged tax regime
Provisions similar to those for thin capitalisation (_see the section_) are also applicable to interest paid or credited by a Brazilian entity to an individual or legal entity (whether or not a related party) resident or domiciled in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction under a privileged tax regime. In these cases, the interest expense is only deductible for Brazilian income tax purposes if it is viewed as necessary to the company’s activities and the total amount of the Brazilian entity’s debt with any foreign party resident or domiciled in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction under a privileged tax regime does not exceed 30% of the Brazilian entity's net equity.
The Law also provides that amounts paid, credited, delivered, used, or remitted under any title, directly or indirectly, to related or unrelated individuals or legal entities that are resident or domiciled in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction under a privileged tax regime will only be viewed as deductible for Brazilian income tax purposes if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the effective beneficiary of the payment is identified; (ii) there is evidence that the payment beneficiary has operational capacity (i.e. substance); and (iii) there is adequate documentation to support the relevant payments and the corresponding supply of goods, rights, or utilisation of services.
### Tax havens and privileged tax regime lists
The RFB has issued a list (i.e. ‘black list’) detailing the jurisdictions that are considered not to tax income or to tax it at a rate lower than 20%, or that deny access to information regarding shareholding and ownership of assets and rights.
Another list (i.e. ‘grey list’) contemplates jurisdictions that are considered to have ‘privileged tax regimes’, as set forth in Brazilian legislation. The following types of entities are included in the grey list:
  * Holding companies incorporated under the law of Denmark, which do not carry out substantive economic activity.
  * Holding companies incorporated under the law of the Netherlands, which do not carry out substantive economic activity.
  * International trading companies (ITCs) incorporated under the law of Iceland.
  * Holding company, domiciliary company, auxiliary company, mixed company, and administrative company incorporated in Switzerland and other legal entities subject to a ruling issued by the tax authorities that apply a combined tax rate lower than 20%.
  * Limited liability companies (LLCs) incorporated under the state law of the United States, owned by non-residents and not subject to federal income tax.
  * ITCs and international holding companies (IHCs) incorporated under the law of Malta.
  * Holding companies incorporated under the law of Austria that do not carry out substantive economic activities.
  * Foreign Trade Zones located in Costa Rica.
  * International Business Centre of Madeira (IBCM) in Portugal.
  * 20 different regimes of companies incorporated in Singapore.


A foreign holding company is deemed to carry out substantive economic activities if it has, in its country of domicile, operating capacity to manage and make decisions regarding (i) activities with the purpose of generating income from its assets or (ii) management of equity interests with the purpose of generating income in the form of profit distributions and capital gains.
Operating capacity should be measured by (i) the existence of physical facilities and (ii) qualified employees to manage and make decisions according to the complexity of the tasks to be performed. It is important to note that the definition only expressly makes reference to Dutch and Danish holding companies although it also could be considered to apply to Austrian holding companies.
It is generally understood that the concept of a privileged tax regime is subject to stricter transfer pricing, thin capitalisation, and tax deduction rules. There are also a number of adverse implications from a Brazilian CFC perspective. For the jurisdictions considered tax havens, in addition to the tax consequences applicable for privileged tax regimes above, the IRRF rate due on capital gains and cross-border payments, such as services fees, royalties, and interest, is generally 25%.
In 2014, an NI issued by the RFB reduced from 20% to 17% the minimum income tax rate used as a reference to list the tax havens and privileged tax regimes. This threshold was reduced for jurisdictions and regimes aligned to the ’international standards of fiscal transparency‘; however, jurisdictions that meet such requirements are not automatically excluded from the black or grey lists.
## Bad debt
Losses on bad debts are tax deductible, depending on the amounts, time overdue, and administrative and/or legal actions taken to recover losses. Losses arising from inter-company transactions are not tax deductible.
## Charitable contributions
Donations are deductible, up to certain limits, if recipients are registered as charitable institutions.
## Travel expenses
Travel expenses may only be considered deductible if they are incurred in connection with business activities, duly documented and substantiated.
## Medical and pension expenses
Expenses of group medical care and health insurance programmes for employees and contributions to private supplementary pension schemes are generally considered deductible if supplied to all employees indiscriminately.
## Fines and penalties
Punitive tax/contribution penalties are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes/contributions
Taxes, contributions, and related costs, such as late-payment interest, are generally deductible for tax purposes on an accrual basis. This rule does not apply to taxes/contributions being or to be challenged by the taxpayer at any level of litigation, which are deductible for tax purposes only on a cash basis.
## Tax losses carried forward
Tax losses (i.e. for IRPJ and CSLL purposes) may be carried forward without any time limitation. However, the tax loss may not reduce taxable income by more than 30% of its amount prior to the compensation of the tax loss itself (and is subject to certain loss recoupment rules).
There is no carryback of tax losses or monetary restatement.
## Payments to foreign affiliates and related companies
Royalties and technical service fees (with a transfer of technology or know-how) payable to foreign companies with a direct or indirect controlling interest in the Brazilian company are deductible for tax purposes (observing applicable deduction limits), provided the contract has been duly registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (_Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial_ or INPI) and approved by the Brazilian Central Bank.
## Payments under so-called "cost-sharing arrangements"
Reimbursements paid under the Brazilian so-called "cost-sharing arrangements" (reimbursement of costs) may be considered deductible for IRPJ and CSLL purposes, to the extent that certain requirements set forth by administrative decisions (especially tax ruling COSIT 8/2012) are met by the company performing such payments.


# Brazil
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Consolidated tax returns are not permitted in Brazil.
## Transfer pricing (applicable until 31 December 2023)
The Brazilian transfer pricing rules apply to import and export transactions of goods, services, and rights between related parties (the legislation provides a broad list of the parties considered as ‘related’ for transfer pricing purposes). Under such rules, the price determined between related parties shall be acceptable, for Brazilian tax purposes, if it is in accordance with one of the transfer pricing methods established by the legislation (no profit methods are available). Since there is no best method approach, taxpayers can choose the least onerous alternative for each good, service, or right on an annual basis (except in cases involving listed commodities). Moreover, all transactions with both tax havens and those subject to privileged tax regimes are subject to transfer pricing rules, whether involving related parties or not.
### Interest
Brazilian transfer pricing rules are applicable to interest derived from/charged to inter-company loans and/or with entities situated in low-tax jurisdictions, and such interest must comply with the rates established below, in addition to a spread determined by the Ministry of Finance, in order to be acceptable for tax deductibility purposes:
  1. In case of transaction in US dollars, subject to a fixed interest rate: Rate of Brazilian sovereign bonds issued in US dollars in foreign markets.
  2. In case of transaction in Brazilian reais, subject to a fixed interest rate: Rate of Brazilian sovereign bonds issued in Brazilian reais in foreign markets.
  3. In all other cases (e.g. euros): LIBOR for the period of six months.


The additional spread is currently set at 3.5% per year, applicable to interest due to foreign-related parties or to low-tax jurisdictions, and 2.5% per year, in case of interest charged by the Brazilian entity.
For transactions covered in item (iii) above, in currencies for which there is no specific LIBOR, the LIBOR for deposits in US dollars shall be the one to be considered.
### Royalties
Operations involving royalties registered with the National Institute of Intellectual Property should not generally be subject to transfer pricing rules.
### Services/Goods/Rights
The adequacy of the price performed between related parties in any operations involving goods, services, and rights shall be supported by the application of one of the following transfer pricing methods, as determined in the Brazilian transfer pricing rules (the company may choose the most convenient method as there is no ‘best method’ rule).
Methods available for documenting the import transactions:
  * Comparable independent price (PIC).
  * Resale price less profit (PRL).
  * Production cost plus profit (CPL).
  * Imports of quoted commodities (PCI) - applicable only to commodities.


Methods available for documenting the export transactions:
  * Export sales price (PVEx).
  * Wholesale price in the country of destination less profit (PVA).
  * Retail price in the country of destination less profit (PVV).
  * Acquisition or production cost plus taxes and profit (CAP).
  * Export of quoted commodities (PECEX) - applicable only to commodities.


Relief of proof rules (materiality and profitability safe harbours) for inter-company export transactions are available.
Please note that imports and exports of commodities, quoted in commodities exchange markets, must be tested by the use of specific methods called PCI and PECEX, respectively. Based on these methods, taxpayers shall compare the transaction amounts with the daily average quote for each product. 
Taxpayers should prepare the transfer pricing analysis in accordance with the provisions of Law 9,430/96 and further amendments, as well as respective guidelines from the tax administration, mainly substantiated in IN/RFB 1,312/12. Please note that substantial changes related to the tested price and parameter price analysis were made through the more recent IN 1,870/19.
## Transfer pricing (mandatory for 2024 onwards, optional for 2023)
As defined by law, the application of the new rules is optional for fiscal year 2023 (retroactively for transactions as of 1 January 2023) but will be mandatory for fiscal year 2024 (starting at 1 January 2024). The deadline for exercising this early adoption option is 31 December 2023.
In June 2023, the Brazilian government converted the MP 1152/22 into Law 14,596, which aligns the Brazilian transfer pricing rules with the arm’s-length principle in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
The new legislation is mostly principles-based and delegates substantial authority to regulations to be issued by the RFB through INs.
The main aspects of the new legislation are summarised below, but a detailed analysis of the new transfer pricing system is highly recommended: 
  * Introduction of the arm’s-length principle in the law as the pillar of the new system.
  * Definition of related parties considering the ’influence‘ exercised directly or indirectly by another party, which may lead to the establishment of terms and conditions in their transactions that differ from those that would be set between unrelated parties in comparable transactions.
  * The transfer pricing provisions also apply to transactions carried out with any entity resident or domiciled in low-tax countries or considered beneficiary of a ’privileged tax regime‘, both cases referencing a corporate tax rate of 17%.
  * Controlled transaction comprises any commercial or financial relationship between two or more related parties, established or carried out directly or indirectly, including contracts or arrangements in any form and series of transactions and is not limited to imports and exports of goods, services, and rights, as well as interest.
  * Comparable transaction concept is consistent with international standards.
  * The most appropriate method must be selected considering the facts and circumstances of the transactions and the availability of reliable information of comparable transactions, among other factors. There are no more fixed margins, and traditional transactional methods (i.e. comparable independent price method [PIC], resale price minus profit method [PRL], cost plus profit method [MCL]), as well as the profit-based methods (i.e. transactional net margin method [MLT] and profit split method [MDL]), are accepted, as well as a combination of methods is allowed.
  * The use of an interquartile range in a panel of comparables is allowed. Also, when the data collected is deemed reliable, the full range of comparables is the appropriate one.
  * Spontaneous and corresponding adjustments are allowed, while primary adjustments can be imposed by the tax authority.
  * Transactions with intangibles, intragroup services, cost contribution agreements (CCAs), business restructurings, and financial transactions have specific provisions consistent with the latest version of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.


On 29 September 2023, The RFB issued IN 2,161/2023, the first set of regulations to rule the Law. Further guidance through new INs is expected to address topics that were not included in this first regulation.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Although Brazil recently introduced the obligation to present the CbC report, it has not yet imposed the obligation to file either the Master or the Local file.
## Thin capitalisation
The Brazilian thin capitalisation rules establish that interest paid or credited by a Brazilian entity to a related party (individual or legal entity), resident or domiciled abroad, not constituted in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction with a privileged tax regime, may only be deducted for income tax purposes if the interest expense is viewed as necessary for the activities of the local entity and the following requirements are met:
  1. the amount of debt granted by the foreign-related party (which has participation in the Brazilian entity) does not exceed twice the amount of its participation in the net equity of the Brazilian entity
  2. the amount of debt granted by a foreign-related party (which does not have participation in the Brazilian entity) does not exceed twice the amount of the net equity of the Brazilian entity
  3. the total amount of debt granted by foreign-related parties as per (i) and (ii) does not exceed twice the sum of participation of all related parties in the net equity of the Brazilian entity, and
  4. in case debt is only granted by related parties that do not have a participation in the Brazilian entity, the total amount of debt granted by all of these related parties does not exceed twice the amount of the Brazilian entity’s net equity.


Consequently, if one of the mentioned 2:1 ratios is exceeded, the portion of interest related to the excess debt amount will not be deductible for Brazilian income tax purposes.
Similar provisions are also applicable to interest paid or credited by a Brazilian entity to an individual or legal entity (whether or not a related party) resident or domiciled in a tax haven or in a jurisdiction subject to a privileged tax regime. In these cases, the ratio reduces to 30% of the Brazilian entity's net equity (0.3:1 ratio).
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Law No. 12,973/2014 introduced rules for the treatment of controlled and affiliated companies for Brazilian CFC purposes.
For controlled companies, the law expressly applies to both directly and indirectly controlled entities individually (‘top down look through approach’). As such, any investment in a controlled foreign entity must be adjusted yearly to reflect the change in the investment value corresponding to the profits or losses of the directly and/or indirectly controlled entity. The change in investment must be recognised in proportion to the Brazilian parent’s participation in its equity, and any positive adjustment relating to profits earned, calculated under the local accounting standards of the jurisdiction of the controlled entity, must be subject to IRPJ and CSLL annually.
Taxpayers will be allowed to consolidate positive and negative adjustments until 2024, provided certain conditions are satisfied as defined by the legislation (the initial term was 2022, which was then postponed to 2024).
One of the requirements introduced by the legislation is related to the concept of the sub-taxation jurisdiction, which is defined as being a jurisdiction that has a nominal income tax rate of less than 20%. In order to be able to consolidate, a company cannot be subject to a sub-taxation regime, in addition to not being subject to a privileged tax regime or resident in a tax haven (or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such entities).
In case the taxpayer does not choose to consolidate its accounting losses, losses will only be compensated by the foreign controlled entity with its own future profits. Accumulated losses accrued before the above-mentioned law may also be used to offset profits without any time limitation, subject to appropriate disclosure.
Under certain conditions, taxpayers may choose to pay income tax due on the foreign profits proportionally to the profits actually distributed to the Brazilian entity, in subsequent periods to that in which such results were generated. However, in the first year, even where there is no distribution of profits, 12.5% of profits will be deemed to be distributed to the Brazilian parent. If no further profits are distributed, the remaining profits will be deemed to be distributed in the eighth subsequent year. Taxpayers choosing to postpone payment of income tax due should consider the impact of interest as well as foreign exchange rates.
In addition to corporate taxes paid, the law expressly extends foreign tax credits to withholding income tax paid abroad on the profits distributed to the Brazilian parent.
For affiliated companies, the law does not require adjustments to the Brazilian entity’s accounts but rather focuses on the profits distributed. Profits will be considered distributed to the parent when credited or paid or in other specific circumstances defined by the legislation. As such, any profits earned by a Brazilian entity through a foreign affiliate will generally only be taxable in Brazil on 31 December of the year in which they were actually distributed to the Brazilian entity, provided that the affiliate satisfies certain conditions defined by the legislation, including not being located in a low-tax jurisdiction.
The CFC rules will not apply for directly or indirectly controlled foreign entities and affiliates in case of activities related to the exploration of oil and gas in Brazil.
Until calendar year 2024, Brazilian parent companies may deduct up to 9% as a presumed/deemed credit on the CFC’s taxable profit, generated by investments abroad that are engaged in the manufacture of food and beverage products and in the construction of building/infrastructure works (the initial term was 2022, which was then postponed to 2024).
This list of activities has been extended to include manufacturing, mineral extraction, exploitation, under public concession contracts, of public assets located in the country of residence of the CFC entity, as well as other general industry.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Brazilian resident companies are taxed on worldwide income, but they may offset the income tax paid in the country of domicile of the branch, controlled, or associated company, and the tax paid on earnings and capital gains, against the corporate income tax due in Brazil. The amount of tax effectively paid abroad, to be offset, may not exceed the amount of income tax and surtax due in Brazil on the amount of profits, earnings, and capital gains included in the calculation of taxable income.
_Please refer to Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the section for a description of the use of foreign tax credits_.
## Investment project incentives
Total or partial exemption from duty, excise tax, and social contributions on imported equipment is granted on certain approved investment projects.
Approved investment projects are also granted accelerated depreciation on nationally produced equipment and access to low-cost financing. Sales of some capital equipment are exempt from state sales tax.
Brazilian corporate taxpayers can recover a portion of their income tax and social contributions taxes on revenues (PIS/COFINS) based on investment in their own approved investment projects. These approved investment projects are normally granted total or partial income tax exemption. As of December 2023, MP 1,185/23 was converted into Law 14,789/23, effective as of January 2024, and it changes the means and limits for such tax relief.
The Brazilian legislation also provides tax incentives for projects focusing on technological innovation.
## Program for Investment Partnerships
The Program for Investment Partnerships (_Programa de Parcerias de Investimentos_ or PPI) intends to amplify and strengthen the interaction between the Brazilian state and private sector through partnership agreements to carry out public infrastructure projects.
PPIs can be used for (i) public infrastructure projects that are already under way or to be performed through partnership agreements to be signed by the direct or indirect bodies of the Brazilian federal government; (ii) public infrastructure projects to be performed through partnerships signed by the government of states or municipalities directly or indirectly, but delegated or fomented by the federal government; and (iii) other measures established by the National Privatization Plan, per law 9,491/97.
The Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) is authorised to support the PPIs through the Partnership Structuring Support Fund (_Fundo de Apoio à Estruturação de Parcerias_ or FAEP), created specifically for such partnerships. The fund will be responsible for providing technical services to structure the aforementioned PPIs and the necessary privatisation measures, and shall have a ten-year period, renewable for an additional ten-year period if necessary.
## Regional incentives
Income tax exemptions or reductions are also available for companies set up in specified regions within Brazil, primarily the north and northeast regions. These incentives are designed to accelerate the development of certain less-developed regions and industries considered to be of importance to the economy.
## ICMS tax incentives - State tax incentives / benefits
According to the Federal legislation (Complementary Law 24/1975), the ICMS tax incentives or similar tax benefits granted by an individual state should be approved by all states through an agreement with the National Council of Fiscal Policy (CONFAZ). However, such tax incentives were usually granted by the states without this formal acceptance. As a result, ICMS tax incentives, granted in such terms, were or could be challenged by the other states, claiming the unconstitutionality of the incentive.
In 2017, the Brazilian Congress approved the validation of all ICMS tax incentives currently granted by the Brazilian states to taxpayers. In practical terms, such validation will sort out the so-called 'tax war' in which any state would not be able to challenge going forward the unconstitutionality of any ICMS tax incentive already granted at the Supreme Court level. It is worth mentioning that, if the VAT reform currently under discussion is approved, such incentives will remain in force until the end of the transition period (i.e. December 2032), being gradually reduced over the years.
In this sense, all states have listed their ICMS tax incentives in order to be valid as per the applicable tax legislation (Complementary Law 160/2017 and CONFAZ Agreement 190/2017). Until each of such incentives is valid, other states may grant similar tax incentives of any other state to their taxpayers in order to achieve tax equality.
Under the new VAT tax system, the "Compensation Fund for Tax or Financial-Tax Benefits of ICMS" will be established to compensate, by December 31, 2032, the legal entities benefiting from exemptions, incentives, and tax or financial benefits related to ICMS, granted for a certain period and under defined conditions. The criteria will be established by Complementary Law.
## Other incentives
In addition, certain excise and sales tax exemptions are granted to exporters of manufactured goods.


# Brazil
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Profits/dividends distributed to resident or non-resident beneficiaries (individuals and/or legal entities) are generally not subject to IRRF (Brazilian term for withholding income tax) (_please see the section for more information_). This provision is also applicable to dividends paid to non-resident companies located in a tax haven jurisdiction.
The IRRF rate applicable to payments for services, royalties, and interest to non-resident companies or individuals is generally 15% but can be increased to 25% in certain cases. Other transactional taxes also need to be considered on such payments.
Payments for services, royalties, and interest to non-resident companies located in a tax haven jurisdiction (black list only) are subject to IRRF at the rate of 25%.
The RFB issued guidance in relation to how they should treat certain service fees, which, in effect, allow certain payments to be exempt from IRRF in Brazil, under certain tax treaties.
Certain types of income paid by Brazilian companies to non-resident recipients are subject to IRRF as follows:
Recipient | IRRF (%) (3)  
---|---  
Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties  
Non-resident companies and individuals:

Notes
  1. Note that the remittance of dividends is generally not subject to taxation in Brazil.
  2. Treaty rates in excess of those in force for non-treaty countries are automatically reduced. The relevant treaty should be consulted on a case-by-case basis to confirm that the tax reduction is applicable in each case.
  3. For treaties with multiple IRRF rates, the following rules generally apply: 
     * Dividends: If there was IRRF on dividends, which is not the case according to Brazilian legislation, the 10% (or 15%) rate would generally apply if the beneficial owner is a company that directly holds a certain minimum participation in the capital of the company paying the dividends; the 15% (or 25%) rate is considered for all other cases.
     * Interest: The 10% rate generally applies to loans with a certain minimum term granted for specific purposes (e.g. acquisition of capital goods); the 15% rate is considered for all other cases.
     * Royalties: The 10% rate generally applies to royalties arising from the use of, or the right to use, cinematographic films, films or tapes for television or radio broadcasting, and any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work produced by a resident of a contracting state; the 25% (or 15%) rate generally applies to royalties arising from the use of, or the right to use, trademarks; and the 15% (or 10%) rate is considered for all other cases.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
## Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
Since June 2014, the RFB has closely followed the discussions of the G20/OECD BEPS project and adopted a series of measures in relation to the minimum standards proposed by the BEPS Action Plans. As a result of the formal request from Brazil to join the OECD as a full member in 2017, additional developments in relation to other OECD BEPS initiatives have been implemented.
### Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance (MCAA)
Although not strictly developed under the BEPS project, the MCAA, signed by Brazil and in force since October 2016, provides a platform for automatic and on-demand exchange of information between tax authorities of different jurisdictions.
Under the umbrella of the MCAA, Brazil has signed two Multilateral Competent Authority Agreements, which will allow tax authorities to automatically exchange financial information (CRS MCAA) and country-by-country reportings (CbC MCAA).
### Common reporting standards (CRS)
On 29 December 2016, the RFB issued the final regulations in relation to the implementation of the CRS in Brazil. The regulations define the relevant information that should be exchanged, including information on financial assets, as well as the specific procedures that should be followed by the financial institutions that will present the report starting in 2018.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
On 29 December 2016, the RFB issued the final regulations in relation to the implementation of the CbC reporting, establishing the framework under which multinational enterprises (MNEs) are required to disclose information in Brazil related to their economic activities worldwide. The information has been disclosed on the Corporate Income Tax Return (ECF) since 2017.
### Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)
RFB issued Normative Instruction 1669/2016 laying out the rules to allow taxpayers to access the MAP. Although Brazil had included Article 25 of the OECD Model Convention (related to MAP provision) in its Double Tax Treaties, before NI 1669/2016 there were no specific procedures to access this resource. On 28 November 2018, NI 1669/2016 was revoked by NI 1846/2018, which added a few additional clarifications for the MAP. 
In December 2018, a manual for the MAP was published by the tax authorities, further illustrating the processes to be followed in order to make use of the MAP.
### Multilateral Convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS (MLI)
Brazil has not signed the MLI, but has started to include the minimum anti-abusive standards in its newly negotiated treaties.
### Exchange of information of Brazilian Rulings
Normative Instruction 1689/2017 introduces the compulsorily exchange of information on tax rulings rule, which according to the RFB should include '_solução de consulta'_ , '_solução de divergência',_ and '_ato declaratório interpretativo'_. The exchange of information should be restricted to transfer pricing, PE, or the PADIS tax benefit.
## Brazilian pension reform bill in 2019
Brazil has a historical public debt issue related to the public pension regime, which has begun to be reformed for upcoming years. After considerable discussion during past years, a reform was approved in 2019.
The reform has established certain measures to reduce the current social security deficit, such as raising the minimum retirement age and reducing or restructuring some of the benefits currently available to workers, both from private companies as well as civil workers.
It should be noted that a transition regime is currently in force, designed to capture the situation of the workers and employees who had already started to contribute to the public pension regime but had not yet officially retired.
## Ongoing Brazilian tax reform proposals
Brazil is the home to an increasingly complex and overly bureaucratic tax system, with several different ancillary obligations and different types of taxes, which have traditionally led to a significant cost for tax compliance that is not mirrored in other jurisdictions.
As a result, a tax reform has always been discussed, but it was not until 2019 and with a new presidential term starting that such discussions got more tangible.
On December 20, 2023, the Brazilian Congress enacted the VAT reform representing a historic milestone for Brazil, beginning the long-awaited modernization of its complex and uncompetitive tax system.
The main changes were the elimination of 4 taxes (Social Security Financing Contribution - COFINS, Contribution to the Social Integration Program - PIS, State Indirect Tax - ICMS, Local Services Tax - ISS), reduction of the general IPI (Federal Tax on ManufacturedProducts) rate to zero and the creation of 3 new taxes: Federal Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS), Subnational Tax on Goods and Services (IBS) (States and Municipalities) and Federal Excise Tax (IS).
The transition period will be marked by a coexistence of two tax systems with old and new taxes collected in parallel for 7 years
Although not formally presented by the current government, the Corporate Income Tax Reform, which will likely include measures such as CIT rate reduction and reintroduction of WHT for dividends, is the potential next topic; however, the current environment is still heavily driven by uncertainty so currently is difficult to determine and/or predict the actual changes that will be proposed and the expected timing for this to happen.


# Brazil
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Brazilian taxpayers are subject to IRPJ and CSLL using an ‘actual profits’ method (i.e. APM - _Lucro Real_), which is based on taxable income (i.e. earnings before taxes or EBT), adjusted by certain additions and exclusions as determined by the legislation. The actual profit can be calculated annually or quarterly. For the annual calculation, the tax authorities collect anticipations during the year, as the taxpayer is required to calculate the income tax monthly.
Subject to certain restrictions (i.e. where gross income does not exceed BRL 78 million and depending on the activity), Brazilian taxpayers have the option to calculate IRPJ and CSLL using a ‘presumed profits’ method (i.e. PPM - _Lucro Presumido_). Under the PPM, the income is calculated on a quarterly basis on an amount equal to different percentages of gross revenue (i.e. based on the entity’s activities) and adjusted as determined by the prevailing legislation. Below we exemplify the main presumed profit rates that must be applied to determine the calculation basis:
Activities | Presumed profit rate (%)  
---|---  
Retail sale of fuel and natural gas | 1.6  
Sale of goods or products | 8.0  
Cargo transportation  
Real estate activities (purchase, sale, subdivision, development, and construction of real estate)  
Hospital services  
Rural activity  
Industrialisation with materials supplied by the client  
Other unspecified activities (except services)  
Transportation services (except freight) | 16.0  
General services with gross revenues up to BRL 120,000/year (*)  
Professional services (Simple Societies [SS], doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, auditors, engineers, consultants, economists, etc.) | 32.0  
Business intermediation  
Administration, lease, or assignment of movable/immovable property or rights  
Construction services, when the provider does not use materials owned by it or is not responsible for the execution of the work.  
Services in general, for which no specific percentage is established  
In the case of exploration of diversified activities, the respective percentage will be applied to the gross revenue of each activity. | 1.6 to 32.0  
* Not applied to legal entities engaged in the performance of hospital activities or transportation services, as well as the professional services societies.
## Inventory valuation
Brazilian income tax regulations require that inventory may be valued at the actual average cost or by the cost of the most recently acquired or produced goods. Rulings to the effect that last in first out (LIFO) is not acceptable have been given. With the introduction of the public digital bookkeeping system (i.e. SPED), the Brazilian tax authorities (i.e. RFB) should have access to the productive process and inventory movement of companies (_see the section for more information_).
## Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the sale of assets and rights, including shares/quotas, are generally taxed as ordinary income.
Carried forward capital losses may be offset only against capital gains. Unused capital losses are treated similarly to income tax losses with regard to limits on use and carryforward period. Capital losses may be used to offset other operating income in the year that they are incurred.
Capital gains derived by non-residents (including transactions carried out abroad between two non-resident investors, involving assets or rights located in Brazil) may be taxed in Brazil.
Such gains should be subject to progressive income tax rates, which range from 15% (for capital gain that does not exceed BRL 5 million) to 22.5% (for the portion of the gain that exceeds BRL 30 million), as per the table below:
Capital gain (BRL) | Income tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 5 million | 15.0  
5 million | 10 million | 17.5  
10 million | 30 million | 20.0  
30 million | 22.5  
For beneficiaries residing in tax haven jurisdictions, the rate applicable remains at 25%, irrespective of the amount of the gain, due to an explicit provision in the law for these situations.
Exemptions from capital gains taxation may be available for specific transactions (e.g. certain regulated investments on the Brazilian stock market).
## Dividend income
In general terms, no IRRF is due on cash dividends or profits paid or credited to either corporate or individual shareholders. Brazilian resident beneficiaries are not subject to further income tax on receipt of dividends.
## Financial income
Fixed-rate interest income from short, medium, or long-term financial market transactions, including swap transactions, is subject to IRRF at rates ranging from 15% to 22.5%. Non-fixed financial gains related to stock/commodities exchange and/or futures market transactions are taxed at rates of 20% (day-trade) and 15% (all other cases). For legal entities, the total income or gain is considered taxable income, and the tax withheld may be offset against the total tax due by the corporate taxpayer.
Additionally, PIS/COFINS may be levied at a rate of up to 4.65%, depending on the type of transactions and taxation regime (i.e. non-cumulative method).
## Royalty income
Under Brazilian tax legislation, royalties are defined as the remuneration agreed between contracting parties for the use or exploration of:
  * industrial property rights (i.e. patents, trademarks, brand names, and other rights of the same nature)
  * know-how (sharing of technical information, necessary for the industrial manufacturing of a product or process, deriving from experience previously acquired), and
  * copyrights.


Royalty income should be subject to regular corporate income taxation in Brazil.
## Foreign currency exchange gain/loss
With respect to foreign currency exchange gain/loss, which may arise from receivables or liabilities denominated in foreign currency, Brazilian tax legislation allows the local company to elect to consider the related effect, for tax computation purposes, either upon an accrual or cash basis (i.e. actual receipt/payment of funds).
## Foreign income
Brazilian resident companies are taxed on worldwide income. _See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the section for more information_.


# Brazil
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
Brazilian resident companies are taxed on worldwide income. Non-resident companies are generally taxed in Brazil through a registered subsidiary, branch, or PE, based on income generated locally. Other than that, non-resident companies can be subject to withholding tax (IRRF) on income derived from a Brazilian source.
Corporate income tax (IRPJ) is assessed at the fixed rate of 15% on annual taxable income, using either the 'actual profits' method (APM) or the 'presumed profits' method (PPM) (_see the section_).
## Surcharge
Corporate taxpayers are also subject to a surcharge of 10% on the annual taxable income in excess of 240,000 Brazilian reais (BRL).
## Social Contribution on Net Income (CSLL)
Legal entities are generally subject to CSLL at the rate of 9% (except for some prescribed entities, such as financial institutions and private insurance companies, which are taxed at higher rates), which is not deductible for IRPJ purposes. The tax base is the profit before income tax, after some adjustments, depending on the calculation method (i.e. APM or PPM).
## Local income taxes
Corporate income taxes are levied only at the federal level (i.e. there are no state or municipal income taxes).

## Corporate - Other taxes

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The Brazilian indirect taxes system is complex and has been subject to multiple changes during the past years. The text below contains general information applicable to each of the taxes herein mentioned. It is important to note that the respective legislation includes various exceptions to the general stated rules. In the case of the state VAT (ICMS), although a federal law should be followed, each state issues its own legislation, which brings certain differences when compared to the federal law.
The Brazilian indirect tax system comprises three key indirect taxes:
  * VAT on Sales and certain Services (ICMS)
  * Excise Tax (IPI), and
  * Service Tax (ISS),


which are state, federal, and municipal taxes, respectively.
### VAT on Sales and Services (ICMS)
ICMS is a state tax on the circulation of merchandise, electric power, rendering of interstate and intermunicipal transportation services, and communications, even when the transaction and the rendering of services start in another country. It is not a cumulative tax, that is, the tax is only assessed on the increase in the price of the product in each part of the circulation process.
The calculation process involves a system where the taxpayer should check the amount of debits and credits related to the state VAT. In case the taxpayer upholds more debits than credits, the taxpayer will be required to pay tax on the difference between them.
In summary, the credits are calculated when the raw materials enter the taxpayer’s premises, and the debits are computed when the final product exits the establishment. Moreover, ICMS credits are not allowed for all acquisitions (e.g. use and consumptions items), and, as a rule, taxpayers are not allowed to account for credits on materials purchased that will be used as inputs for non-taxable goods (with some exceptions, such as exports).
ICMS is due on a monthly basis; however, on imports, ICMS is due on customs clearance.
The internal ICMS rates vary according to each State of Brazil, ranging, as a rule, from 17% to 20%. In the State of São Paulo, for example, ICMS is collected at an 18% rate. Certain products can attract a higher internal rate (such as 25%) or a lower internal rate (such as 12%). Different states may apply different rates according to the type of good as well as the nature of the operation.
Special rates apply to interstate sales, as shown in the chart below. A 4% rate applies on all interstate sales of imported goods.
From (shipper) | To (addressee) | Rate (%)  
---|---|---  
South and Southeast | South and Southeast | 12  
North, Northeast, and Midwest | Any Brazilian state | 12  
South and Southeast * | North, Northeast, and Midwest * | 7  
* Including the State of Espírito Santo.
#### ICMS-ST regime
In order to avoid illegal tax evasion, enhance the tax control processes, and facilitate tax collection, the legislation may appoint a single taxpayer of a product’s chain as the sole liable party, who will collect the ICMS due by all parties until the final consumer. The so-called ICMS-ST regime is imposed for certain goods as listed by each state tax legislation.
#### ICMS due on interstate sales of goods to final consumers
As a general rule, ICMS is collected by the state where the supplier of the goods is located. ICMS is collected by most states at internal rates ranging from 17% to 20% (some products attract a lower/higher rate). As noted above, special rates apply to interstate sales, which will be equivalent to 4%, 7%, or 12%, depending on the location of the supplier and client, as well as whether the goods are imported, have a certain content of imported inputs, or are domestically sourced.
The legislation determines that on interstate transactions with final consumers, the 4%, 7%, or 12% rates shall be applied (instead of the internal rate), and the difference between the internal and interstate rates shall be paid by the acquirer (transactions between ICMS taxpayers) or supplier (transactions involving non-ICMS taxpayers) of the goods to the consumer’s state.
### Excise Tax (IPI)
This Federal excise tax is paid by manufacturers on behalf of their customers at the time of sale, either to another manufacturer who will continue the manufacturing process or to the retailer who sells to the end user.
The tax paid is stated separately on the sales invoice, as is the nature of the goods involved. Certain exemptions are given to goods considered to be of basic necessity to the country's economy. The rates are defined by the product’s tariff code (normally around 5% to 30%, but in certain cases ranging to over 300%) and are in accordance with the essentiality of each product, which generally means that essential products will attract lower tax rates.
As mentioned above, when manufactured products are sold between producers, the IPI is imposed. However, the subsequent manufacturer is allowed a credit against its IPI liability, on the amount of IPI paid to its suppliers (non-cumulative tax, similar to what happens with ICMS). Furthermore, to retailers, IPI is not recoverable and is considered as a cost of the operation.
Imports of goods are also subject to IPI taxation, while exports are not.
IPI is due on a monthly basis; however, on imports, IPI is due on customs clearance.
### Municipal Service Tax (ISS)
The ISS is a municipal tax levied on the provision of services listed by Supplementary Law 116/2003. ISS is imposed on a cumulative basis (it is not creditable), and the rates may vary between 2% and 5%, depending on the type of service (rates to be stipulated on a municipal basis). The municipality to which the ISS must be collected to also changes depending on the nature of the service performed.
Concerning certain services, the municipal legislation may appoint the service recipient as the liable party, establishing its obligation to withhold ISS payment on behalf of the service provider.
Service import is also subject to ISS, to be collected by the Brazilian entity that is contracting the services from a supplier located abroad.
ISS is not levied on export of services. However, if the result of a certain service is verified in Brazil, ISS is imposed, even if the payment for such service is made by a non-resident. The definition of 'result', however, has not yet been pacified in Brazil.
## Import tax
The import duty (II) is a federal tax levied on permanent import of goods into Brazil and is also referred to as import tax or customs duty. The rates vary according to the product’s tariff code based on Mercosur Harmonised System (NCM/SH), usually ranging from 10% to 20% (there are some exceptions, but the maximum consolidated rate is 35%). As a general rule, the taxable basis consists of the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the product (i.e. cost, international insurance, and international freight), calculated pursuant to the World Trade Organization’s (WTO’s) Customs Valuation Agreement.
Import duty is not recoverable by the importer (i.e. it is considered a cost).
## Property taxes
A municipal property tax (IPTU) is levied annually based on the fair market value of property in urban areas at rates that generally vary according to the municipality and location of the property. In the municipality of São Paulo, the basic IPTU rate is 1% for residential properties or 1.5% for commercial properties (both rates may be increased or decreased according to the market value of the property).
## Transfer taxes
A municipal property transfer tax (ITBI) is levied on the transfer of immovable property, with rates also varying based on the municipality where the property is located. The ITBI rate in the municipality of São Paulo is currently 3%, applied over the market value of the property or the transaction price (whichever is higher).
A state property transfer tax (ITCMD) is normally payable at rates varying from state to state on inheritances and donations of goods and rights. In the state of São Paulo, ITCMD is charged at the rate of 4%.
## Tax on financial operations (IOF)
IOF is a tax levied on certain financial operations, such as loans, foreign exchange operations, insurance, and securities, as well as operations with gold (as a financial asset) and foreign exchange instruments. The applicable rate will vary depending on the operation. The IOF rate may be reduced to 0% in some cases, such as: (i) exchange operations relating to the inflow of revenues in Brazil deriving from the export of goods and services; (ii) exchange operations relating to the inflow and outflow of resources in and from Brazil, stemming from foreign loans; and (iii) remittances of interest on net equity and dividends relating to foreign investment.
## Social Contribution on Billing (COFINS)
COFINS, a monthly federal social assistance contribution calculated as a percentage of revenue, is levied at the rate of 7.6%. Under the non-cumulative method, a COFINS credit system is meant to ensure that the tax is applied only once on the final value of each transaction. However, some taxpayers (such as financial institutions, telecommunication companies, cooperatives, and companies that opt to calculate IRPJ and CSLL using a ‘presumed profits’ method) are subject to the cumulative method of COFINS system, which applies a rate of 3% with no credit system.
The general rates of COFINS may be reduced in certain circumstances (e.g. financial revenues may be subject to a rate of 0% or 4% depending on the nature of the transaction). Also, certain transactions are exempt from COFINS (e.g. exportation of services or assets are typically exempt where it results in funds entering Brazil).
Certain products may be subject to a single-phase taxation method, in which the legislation appoints a single taxpayer of a product’s chain as the sole liable party. These types of operations involve specific products listed by the legislation and usually involve a higher applicable tax rate.
## Contribution to the Social Integration Program (PIS)
PIS, which is also a federal social contribution calculated as a percentage of revenue, is levied at the rate of 1.65%. Under the non-cumulative method, a PIS credit system is meant to ensure that the tax is applied only once on the final value of each transaction. However, some taxpayers (such as financial institutions, telecommunication companies, cooperatives, and companies that opt to calculate IRPJ and CSLL using a ‘presumed profits’ method) are still subject to the cumulative method of PIS system, which applies a rate of 0.65% with no credit system.
The general rates of PIS may be reduced in certain circumstances (e.g. financial revenues may be subject to a rate of 0% or 0.65% depending on the nature of the transaction). Also, certain transactions are exempt from PIS (e.g. exportation of services or assets are typically exempt where it results in funds entering Brazil).
Certain products may be subject to a single-phase taxation method, in which the legislation appoints a single taxpayer of a product’s chain as the sole liable party. These types of operations involve specific products listed by the legislation and usually involve a higher applicable tax rate.
## PIS and COFINS on imports
Importation of goods and services are also subject to PIS and COFINS (in addition to other taxes imposed on import transactions). PIS and COFINS are generally imposed on the Brazilian entity or individual (the importer of goods or services) and should apply to the import of services at the rates of 1.65% and 7.6%, respectively.
PIS/COFINS rates on importation of goods, however, are 2.1% (PIS) and 9.65% (COFINS), respectively. Accordingly, the combined general rate for the import of goods is 11.75%. There are also increased rates for PIS and COFINS on importations of certain specific products, including pharmaceutical products; perfumes, cosmetics, and toiletries; machinery; and vehicles (under these cases, specific rates were provided). For the import of certain goods listed in the legislation, an additional 1% for COFINS is also applicable.
The contributions paid upon import transactions may, in some instances, be creditable.
## Payroll taxes
Legal entities incorporated in Brazil are subject to employer social costs, including: Social Security Contribution (INSS), Employees’ Severance Indemnity Fund (FGTS), work accident insurance (RAT), and variable contribution destined to 'third parties' engaged in social development activities (e.g. SENAI, SESC, SESI). As a general rule, INSS is due by the companies at a 20% rate over the employees’ payroll. However, certain entities may be eligible to calculate INSS at a range of 1% to 4.5%, applied on the company’s gross revenue rather than being calculated upon the company’s payroll (CPRB). In relation to FGTS, such contribution is levied on employee’s salary at the rate of 8%.
The employer is responsible to withhold income tax and social security contribution on behalf of the employee on a monthly basis.
## Contribution for Intervention in the Economic Domain (CIDE)
CIDE is a federal contribution levied at the rate of 10% on remittances made by corporate taxpayers for royalties and for administrative and technical services provided by non-residents. CIDE is payable by the local entity, and, therefore, not creditable to the non-resident. CIDE does not represent a liability to the foreign recipient. CIDE is not applied on the payments relating to the license to use, market, or sub-license software, provided that it does not involve transfer of technology, which is considered to be the transfer of the corresponding source code.
