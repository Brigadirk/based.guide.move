## Income Tax Act rewrite
In 2020, Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) Treasury released for public consultation the much-anticipated rewrite of the Income Tax Act (the Act). The consultation draft proposed a commencement date of 1 January 2021. However, despite consultation during 2021 and 2022, the Bill was not presented to Parliament for the budget session in 2021 and was again not presented in November 2022. As of the end of 2022, there has been no formal commitments from Treasury in relation to further consultation or the expected date of entry into force once passed, although the Treasurer did note that, in accordance with feedback from various stakeholders, the Bill's transitional provisions and certain subsidiary legislation would be fully developed before the Bill is presented to Parliament.
This statement from the Treasurer is a reaction to the fact that despite the rewrite being advertised as an attempt to simplify tax law to enable greater participation, and ultimately greater compliance, in the tax system, a number of design features have permeated the initial and most recent drafts, including:
  * simplifying and consolidating provisions in a more consistent and structured manner
  * placing further emphasis on self-assessment
  * assuming the application of the legislated, but not yet enacted, Tax Administration Act by removing administration elements from the rewritten Act, and
  * proposing to implement a number of policy shifts, including some that were previously unannounced.


A number of the proposed policy shifts that may impact companies include:
  * Capital Gains Tax (CGT): The previously announced CGT regime has been narrowed and included. Commencement of a CGT regime will require additional steps beyond the passage of the rewritten Act; however, it is expected to apply to PNG land and interests in companies whereby more than 50% of their assets are PNG land.
  * Resources taxation: Whilst ring fencing of project income and expenditure looks to be maintained, changes to depreciation calculations, including deductions for acquisition costs and the reduction in the additional profits tax uplift factor from 15% to 13%, may impact the resources sector. Transitional provisions and how the measures will impact other projects taxed under the existing regime are the subject of further consultation.
  * Taxation of employment benefits: The rewritten Act has opened the possibility of revisiting the taxation of employment benefits, in particular housing and motor vehicle benefits, from a ‘prescribed value’ approach to a 'market value' approach (albeit with a long transition period). Previous suggestions to revisit this policy were met with strong resistance from a number of stakeholders.
  * Taxation of non-residents: Recent policy changes have sought to rely more heavily on withholding taxes (WHTs), as opposed to income taxes, to collect taxation from non-residents deriving PNG-sourced income. The current draft of the rewritten Act suggests a return to taxation of non-residents in PNG only where a permanent establishment (PE) exists in PNG, with WHTs applying to specific payments of amounts that may be deemed to have a PNG source.


Although the timing for the reintroduction of the Bill is uncertain, if the matters above are relevant to your circumstances, then these potential changes should be considered and discussed with a PwC contact.
## 2024 legislative developments
The National Budget for 2024 introduced legislation to make a temporary increase in the tax-free threshold for salary and wages tax imposed on individuals (SWT) into a permanent change. The annual tax-free threshold is now 20,000 PNG kina (PGK).
There was also a repeal of the dependent tax rebate that was available for individuals to be applicable from 1 January 2024. However, during early 2024, in response to public unrest, the dependent rebate is set to be reinstated. The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) will administer the dependent rebate as remaining in existence from 1 January 2024.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Residents of Papua New Guinea are taxed on their worldwide income. A foreign tax credit may be available to offset foreign tax paid against PNG tax payable (_see the section_).
Non-residents are generally taxed only on their PNG-sourced income. A non-resident's PNG-sourced passive income, including dividends, interest, and royalties, may be subject to WHT. The payer of the dividend, interest, or royalty must withhold the relevant amount of the tax and remit this to PNG's IRC.
## Personal income tax rates
Income derived by individuals, including salary or wages income, will generally be taxed at the following rates:
The rates for residents are as follows:
Taxable income (PGK) | Tax thereon (PGK) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
20,000 | 0 | 30  
33,000 | 3,900 | 35  
70,000 | 16,850 | 40  
250,000 | 88,850 | 42  
The rates for non-residents are as follows:
Taxable income (PGK) | Tax thereon (PGK) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
0 | 0 | 22  
20,000 | 4,400 | 30  
33,000 | 8,300 | 35  
70,000 | 21,250 | 40  
250,000 | 93,250 | 42  
## Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) taxation of individuals
The 2020 Budget included changes to introduce a new SME taxation regime. The regime, which only applies to individuals and excludes employment income and income from professional services, applies such that all tax compliance obligations for the SME (e.g. goods and services tax [GST], personal income tax [PIT]) are satisfied where tax is calculated and paid on the following basis:
  * 2% of turnover for an SME that derives less than PGK 250,000 in an income year, or
  * a PGK 400 annual fee for a business with a turnover of less than PGK 50,000.


Once a taxpayer elects out of the SME regime, or exceeds the threshold, they will be taxed as an individual (i.e. at marginal tax rates).
The changes are intended to encourage the development and increased compliance of SME businesses in Papua New Guinea.

## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the period 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
Taxpayers who have only employment income and are fully taxed at source by virtue of salary or wages tax need not complete an annual income tax return. Taxpayers with other income, such as interest, dividends, rental income, trust distribution, or partnership income, must disclose this in an annual income tax return. Tax payable is generally calculated with reference to graduated tax rates (_see the section for more information_). Income tax is levied by the IRC and not by the states or provinces.
Annual income tax returns are generally due for lodgement by 30 June of the following year under most tax agent lodgement programs. Where a tax agent is not used, the return is due to be lodged by 28 February of the following year. Each individual is assessed separately. There is no joint assessment for husbands and wives.
Papua New Guinea operates on a full assessment basis, and, where required, individuals lodge an annual income tax return showing the calculation of taxable income for the year. In addition, the return must provide detailed disclosures in relation to income derived and expenses incurred during the year of income.
## Payment of tax
Salary or wages income is subject to salary or wages tax and is subject to fortnightly assessment of tax, regardless of the employer's actual pay period. The tax assessed is a final tax and is determined by reference to standard rate tables. Employer's are required to remit salary or wages tax deducted from employee salary or wage payments on a monthly basis.
Provisional tax is levied on non-salary or wages income to ensure that, as far as possible, all income is taxed in the year in which it is earned. Every taxpayer who earns in excess of PGK 100 from non-salary or wages sources has a liability to pay provisional tax. Provisional tax is normally calculated as being equal to the income tax assessed for the preceding year but can be varied to a lesser amount if an application is lodged with the IRC prior to the due date for payment. The tax is payable no earlier than 30 September of the year of income.
Where an individual is served with a notice of assessment to income tax, any tax payable is due within 30 days of the date of service of the notice.


# Papua New Guinea
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Employment expenses
Salary or wage earners receive a 25% rebate for allowable deductions to the extent of any salary or wages tax paid during an income year.
Additionally, an employee can apply to the IRC requesting a variation in the amount of salary or wages tax to be deducted to take into account the expected rebate on work-related expenses or otherwise deductible expenditure (such as housing expenditure). This variation must be made in writing together with fully supported documentation for each expense.
## Business deductions
Non-salary or wage earners or taxpayers who derive other income in addition to salary or wages are allowed deductions incurred in earning their assessable income. Those taxpayers who are eligible and chose to be taxed as an SME are not entitled to tax deductions (_see the section_) as their tax liability is calculated with reference to turnover.
In PNG taxation law, there are general deductions and specific deductions.
Under the general deduction provision, all losses and expenditures, to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing that income, are allowable deductions. This is except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private, or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income.
Specific deductions include:
  * Interest on borrowed funds. 
  * Travelling expenses, in limited circumstances. 
  * Gifts of more than PGK 50 paid to a sporting body established in Papua New Guinea and qualifying charitable organisations. 
  * Depreciation of income-producing assets, such as freehold, leasehold, or company title buildings (except those situated outside Papua New Guinea), motor vehicles, machinery, and equipment. 
  * Rates, advertising, and repairs to rental properties. 
  * Certain tax-related expenses. 


## Personal deductions
Expenditures of a private nature, such as dental or medical costs, are neither deductible nor subject to rebate or credit.
## Personal allowances
In Papua New Guinea, personal allowances take the form of tax credits (s _ee Dependant rebates in the section for more information_).
## Losses
Tax losses incurred in an income year may be carried forward for utilisation in future income years for a maximum of seven years. Losses derived in earning foreign income are quarantined and are therefore not allowable as deductions against PNG-sourced income.
Capital losses are not deductible.

## Individual - Other issues

## Treatment of flow-thru business entities
In Papua New Guinea, individuals may conduct their business through various different structures, including as a sole trader, a partnership, or a trust.
A partnership is required to submit a return of income to the IRC. The net income disclosed in the partnership return is then shared amongst the individual partners for inclusion in their income tax returns. Similarly, losses are also able to be shared amongst partners to offset their individual income.
Trusts that operate a business in Papua New Guinea will be deemed to be resident in Papua New Guinea unless certain criteria are satisfied. The trustee is generally taxed at 30% of the net income of the trust; and unless the trust is a unit trust that meets certain criteria, the income is also taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries who are presently entitled to a share of the net income.

## Employment income
Salary or wages are widely defined to include, in addition to normal employment-related receipts and benefits, any remuneration paid as consultancy fees or fees for professional services, where the remuneration is paid wholly or substantially for personal services performed in Papua New Guinea.
### Payments to employees taxed at 2%
The following payments to employees qualify to be taxed at the rate of 2%:
  * A distribution from a superannuation fund not exceeding the 'prescribed sum' accrued to 31 December 1992, where paid on termination. 
  * A distribution of amounts accrued after 31 December 1992 up to the 'prescribed sum' will be taxed at 2% in the following three circumstances: 
    * Where contributions have been made on behalf of the employee for 15 years. 
    * Where the distribution is to an employee who is age 50 years or over or who is subject to enforced early retirement, provided, in either case, contributions have been made for not less than seven years. 
    * Where the distribution is made as a result of the death or disablement of the employee. 
  * Pay-out of long service leave accrued to 31 December 1992, where paid on termination to an employee who has completed a minimum of six years of continuous service. The leave entitlement must not exceed six months per 15 years of service. 


### Concessional taxation of redundancy payments
Concessional taxation treatment will apply to redundancy payments made after 1 January 2012 under an approved redundancy scheme. The Commissioner General shall approve a redundancy scheme if satisfied that at least 30 employees are to be genuinely made redundant under that scheme or employees are genuinely made redundant from the public sector. The rate of tax applicable to a redundancy payment is 15% up to a cap determined by reference to years of services. Amounts in excess of the cap will be subject to tax at marginal rates.
### Employee benefits
Certain benefits provided to employees are taxed at the prescribed values listed below. The value of benefits not listed below is generally a cost to the employer.
Benefit | Taxable value per fortnight  
---|---  
Accommodation owned or rented by employer | PGK 0 to PGK 2,500 per fortnight, depending on area, market value, or market rental per week.  
Housing allowance | The employee will be taxed on the excess of housing allowance over eligible housing expenditures and on the prescribed value of the housing. A PNG citizen who receives an allowance under an approved Low Cost Housing Scheme is not subject to tax on the allowance.  
Motor vehicle:  
Without fuel | PGK 95 per fortnight.  
With fuel | PGK 125 per fortnight.  
Education expenses (except tertiary education) | PGK 0 (a rebate may be available)  
Leave fares | One annual fare for the employee and family to the place of recruitment or origin is exempt from tax. Alternatively, recreational fares and accommodation for travel within Papua New Guinea equal to the value of the benefit of one annual leave fare are exempt from tax. Additional leave fares are fully taxable; however, additional leave fares within Papua New Guinea for a person employed solely in, or in connection with, most resource projects are exempt. Additional leave fares for employees serving in hardship or remote areas may be exempted from tax at the discretion of the IRC.  
Meals:  
Messing | PGK 30 per fortnight.  
Other | Subject to tax at the employee’s marginal rate on the amount equal to the employer’s cost or may be treated as non-deductible entertainment by the employer.  
Public utilities, gas, domestic services, security, club subscriptions | If paid by the employer on behalf of the employee, not taxable to the employee; however, the employer is denied a deduction for the payment. If paid in the form of an allowance, fully taxable in the hands of the employee.  
Telephone | Fully taxable to the employee at the employee’s marginal rate of tax. However, the employee can claim a rebate for work-related telephone costs.  
Entertainment | If business entertainment expenditure is reimbursed to the employee by the employer, the reimbursement of the actual expenditure is not taxable to the employee. However, the employer is denied a deduction for the entertaining expenses. If paid in the form of an allowance, fully taxable in the hands of the employee.  
Cash allowances | All allowances paid by the employer are to be fully taxed at the employee’s marginal rate of tax.   
## Equity compensation
There are no specific rules around stock options in Papua New Guinea. As such, gains and losses derived or incurred on these instruments are determined based on ordinary concepts and common law principles.
Where stock options have been provided in the course of employment, the value of the benefit provided is likely to be subject to salary or wages tax as employment income.
As noted below, there is no capital gains tax in Papua New Guinea. Where a gain made on stock options is considered to be capital in nature, the gain will not be taxable. It follows that any capital loss incurred is not deductible.
## Capital gains
There is no general capital gains tax in Papua New Guinea. However, profits arising on the sale of property acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit, or from the carrying out of a profit-making scheme, are fully taxable as ordinary income.
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to a dividend WHT at the rate of 15%.
## Interest income
Interest WHT of 15% must be deducted from any interest paid by a financial institution, the Central Bank, or a company to a person resident in Papua New Guinea. The WHT deducted is creditable against tax ultimately payable by a resident recipient on that income.
## Rental income
There are no special rules around rental income. Such income will be assessed as ordinary income and is required to be disclosed in the annual income tax return.


# Papua New Guinea
## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Tax credits are also known as rebates in Papua New Guinea.
## Dependant rebates
The allowable dependant rebates for salary or wage earners are built into the tax rate schedule. Non-salary or wage earners who are resident in Papua New Guinea receive the following rebates for dependants:
  * First dependant: 15% of gross tax with a maximum of PGK 450 and a minimum of PGK 45.
  * Second and third dependants: 10% of gross tax with a maximum of PGK 300 and a minimum of PGK 30.


The maximum rebate available to an individual is PGK 1,050 _per annum_ (i.e. no rebates are available for more than three dependants).
A dependant is a person whose separate net income does not exceed PGK 1,040 in the year and who is either:
  * a spouse of the taxpayer
  * an unmarried child of the taxpayer of less than 16 years of age
  * a student receiving full-time education who is over 16, but less than 25, years of age, or
  * a PNG resident parent of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse.


Although legislation was introduced in the National Budget 2024 to repeal the rebate, in response to public unrest in January 2024, the government have announced that the rebate will continue. The IRC have confirmed that the law for employers will be administered on the basis that the rebate continued to be available from 1 January 2024. 


# Papua New Guinea
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
A person becomes a resident of Papua New Guinea during a year of income in which one commences to reside in Papua New Guinea. The definition extends to a person whose domicile is in Papua New Guinea, unless their permanent place of abode is outside Papua New Guinea, and to a person who is present in Papua New Guinea for a period of more than one-half of the year of income. This is unless the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue is satisfied that the person's usual place of abode is outside Papua New Guinea or that person does not intend to take up residence in Papua New Guinea.

## Contributions to employee superannuation funds
Papua New Guinea does not have a social security system. However, there are compulsory superannuation contributions for PNG citizen employees (superannuation contributions are not currently required for non-citizen employees but may be made on a voluntary basis). An employer of 15 or more persons must register with an authorised superannuation fund, unless operating in an exempt industry (currently certain agricultural sectors). Membership is compulsory for PNG citizens who work for more than 59 days in any three-month period and voluntary for non-citizens.
Contributions are remitted by the employer at the following rates, as a percentage of gross basic salary (excluding overtime, bonus, and commission):
  * 6.0% employee contributions (i.e. after-tax contributions). 
  * 8.4% employer contributions (i.e. pre-tax contributions). 


Distributions from authorised superannuation funds (other than the employee's own contributions) are taxed at the employee's marginal rate unless the distribution to the employee qualifies for concessional taxation. Concessional taxation is based on years of membership of the fund, as set out in the following table:
Years of membership of a fund | Rate of tax  
---|---  
Less than 5 | Marginal rate  
5 to 9 | The lesser of 15% or the marginal rate of tax  
9 to 15 | The lesser of 8% or the marginal rate of tax  
More than 15 | 2%
