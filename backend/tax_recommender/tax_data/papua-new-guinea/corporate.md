## Income Tax Act rewrite
In 2020, Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) Treasury released for public consultation the much-anticipated rewrite of the Income Tax Act (the Act). The consultation draft proposed a commencement date of 1 January 2021. However, despite consultation during 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Bill has not yet been presented to Parliament. As of the middle of 2023, there has been no formal commitments from Treasury in relation to the expected date of entry into force once passed, although the Treasurer did note that, in accordance with feedback from various stakeholders, the Bill's transitional provisions and certain subsidiary legislation would be fully developed before the Bill is presented to Parliament. 
This statement from the Treasurer is a reaction to the fact that despite the rewrite being advertised as an attempt to simplify tax law to enable greater participation, and ultimately greater compliance, in the tax system, a number of design features have permeated the initial and most recent drafts, including:
  * simplifying and consolidating provisions in a more consistent and structured manner
  * assuming the application of the legislated, but not yet enacted, Tax Administration Act by removing administration elements from the rewritten Act, and
  * proposing to implement a number of policy shifts, including some that were previously unannounced.


A number of the proposed policy shifts that may impact companies include:
  * Capital Gains Tax (CGT): The previously announced CGT regime has been further narrowed and included. Commencement of a CGT regime will require additional steps beyond the passage of the rewritten Act; however, it is expected to apply to interests in mining and oil and gas projects.
  * Resources taxation: Whilst ring fencing of project income and expenditure looks to be maintained, changes to depreciation calculations, including deductions for acquisition costs and the reduction in the additional profits tax uplift factor from 15% to 13%, may impact the resources sector. Transitional provisions and how the measures will impact other projects taxed under the existing regime are the subject of further consultation.
  * Taxation of employment benefits: The rewritten Act has opened the possibility of revisiting the taxation of employment benefits, in particular housing and motor vehicle benefits, from a ‘prescribed value’ approach to more of a 'market value' approach (albeit with a long transition period). Previous suggestions to revisit this policy were met with strong resistance from a number of stakeholders.
  * Taxation of non-residents: Recent policy changes have sought to rely more heavily on withholding taxes (WHTs), as opposed to income taxes, to collect taxation from non-residents deriving PNG-sourced income. The current draft of the rewritten Act suggests a return to taxation of non-residents in PNG only where a permanent establishment (PE) exists in PNG, with WHTs applying to specific payments of amounts that may be deemed to have a PNG source.


Although the timing for the reintroduction of the Bill is uncertain, if the matters above are relevant to your circumstances, then these potential changes should be considered and discussed with a PwC contact.
## 2024 National Budget and other legislative developments
The 2024 National Budget (released in November 2023) contained very limited tax changes.
There were no changes to corporate income tax (CIT), and there was no commitment to bring forward the rewrite of the Income Tax Act.
The most significant change was to make a temporary increase in the tax-free threshold for salary and wages tax imposed on individuals (SWT) into a permanent change. There was also a repeal of the dependent tax rebate that was available for individuals to be applicable from 1 January 2024. However, during early 2024, in response to public unrest, the dependent rebate is set to be reinstated.
## MLI and MAAC ratified
At the end of August 2023, the Internal Revenue Commission announced that Papua New Guinea has ratified the Multilateral Administrative Assistance Convention (MAAC) and the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), establishing Papua New Guinea's presence within the realm of international tax collaboration. However, there have been no consequential amendments introduced to legislation.

## Taxable period
The tax year is generally the period 1 January to 31 December; however, application may be made for a substituted tax year-end. These will normally be granted where the substituted tax year-end coincides with the accounting year-end of an overseas holding company. A company’s tax year does not need to be the same as its accounting period.
## Tax returns
Papua New Guinea operates on a full assessment basis, and companies are required to lodge an annual CIT return showing the calculation of taxable income for the year. In addition, the return must provide detailed disclosures in relation to income derived and expenses incurred during the year of income.
A company must file a tax return by 28 February in the year following the year of income to which the return relates. However, the following automatic extensions apply where the company lodges its return through a registered tax agent:
  * Five months from the taxpayer’s year-end for taxable returns and partnership returns.
  * Six months from the taxpayer’s year-end for non-taxable returns.


## Payment of tax
CIT is collected under a provisional tax system. Under this system, tax is paid in respect of a company’s current year profits (i.e. payments made in the year of income are in respect of income derived in the same year as the payment is due).
Provisional tax is assessed by the IRC based on the last return lodged. In the event that no tax was payable on the previous year’s return, the Commissioner General has the right to estimate the amount of tax based on any other information available.
Provisional tax is payable in three equal instalments by 120, 210, and 300 days after commencement of an income year.
Applications may be made to reduce provisional tax assessed if the tax due for the year in question is expected to be lower than the provisional tax assessed. Where estimated provisional tax is less than 75% of the income tax ultimately assessed, additional tax may be levied. Additional tax at a rate of 20% will be assessed, based on the difference between the estimate lodged and the provisional tax originally determined, or the actual tax payable, whichever is less. The Commissioner General has the discretion to require payment of additional tax.
Mining, petroleum, and gas companies are subject to advance payments tax, a system that broadly mirrors the provisional tax system in place for non-resource companies. The main difference for resource companies is they have the option to lodge an estimate of their taxable income for the year prior to 120, 210, and 300 days from the commencement of its income year, which the IRC uses to assess each advance payments tax instalment. 
Following the lodgement of the CIT return, the IRC will serve a notice of assessment on the company. The balance of tax payable for a year of income, after the application of provisional tax (or advance payments tax in the case of a resource company) and other tax credits or rebates, is due to be paid within 30 days of the date of service of the notice of assessment.
## Tax audit process
There is no prescribed tax audit process in Papua New Guinea, and resource constraints have historically limited the IRC's audit activities. However, the IRC has instigated a number of structural changes, including the creation of a Large Taxpayer Office and an enhanced audit and risk assessment function in order to support their review activities. They have also partnered with 'tax inspectors without borders' to conduct a number of audit programs.
## Period for amendment of assessments
Where the IRC considers that a taxpayer made a full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for assessing their returns as originally assessed, the IRC may only amend an assessment that increases the tax liability of the taxpayer within three years from the date that tax became due and payable under the original assessment.
Where the IRC considers that a taxpayer did not make a full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for the assessment of their returns, and there has been an avoidance of tax, then:
  * the IRC may amend any assessments previously issued to the participants if the IRC is of the opinion that the avoidance of tax was due to fraud or evasion (i.e. no time limit applies), or
  * in cases of tax avoidance due to reasons other than fraud or evasion, the IRC may amend an assessment within six years from the date that tax became due and payable under the original assessment.


## Topics of focus for the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC)
In late 2011, the IRC issued Taxation Circular No 2011/2, which provided guidance on transfer pricing matters in Papua New Guinea. The IRC continues to consider transfer pricing as an area of focus and has recently commenced targeted reviews of taxpayers with cross border transactions. 
The IRC has indicated an increased focus on the effective collection of taxes and tax compliance through the implementation of a Standard Integrated Tax Accounting System (SIGTAS). The IRC has indicated that it is likely to replace SIGTAS at some stage before 2023.
Recent audit programs have also focused on employee-related taxes, and they have conducted data matching exercises alongside the immigration department targeting foreign employees and contractors.
The IRC has commenced reviews in relation to taxpayers' related party dealings as it looks to implement a number of BEPS initiatives in the coming years. 


# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
A company will be deemed a resident for CIT purposes if it meets either the (i) incorporation test or (ii) the management and control test.
## Incorporation test
A company incorporated in Papua New Guinea is automatically regarded as a PNG tax resident. However, the operation of the law of another country and a relevant double taxation treaty (DTT) may result in a company also being treated as resident in another country.
## Management and control test
A company is a PNG tax resident if it is managed and controlled in Papua New Guinea, regardless of where it is incorporated. Generally, a company is managed and controlled in Papua New Guinea if key decisions affecting the company are made at directors’ meetings held in Papua New Guinea. This also includes a company incorporated outside Papua New Guinea that trades in Papua New Guinea and has its voting power controlled by resident shareholders.
## Dual residence
An entity may be a tax resident of both Papua New Guinea and another country by application of domestic legislation. A DTT entered into between Papua New Guinea and another country may contain a tiebreaker test to determine the country of residence for the purposes of the DTT.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The concept of 'permanent establishment' has limited significance in the domestic taxation law of Papua New Guinea and is defined to mean a place at or through which a person carries on any business. Under domestic taxation law, Papua New Guinea will seek to tax the PNG-sourced income of a non-resident irrespective of whether or not that income is derived at or through a PE in Papua New Guinea.
Where PNG has entered into a DTT, the concept of PE becomes more important as it will then be one of the factors determining Papua New Guinea’s taxing rights over income sourced in Papua New Guinea, particularly with respect to the business profits of a non-resident company. In general terms, Papua New Guinea’s DTTs:
  * define a PE to be a fixed place at or through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on, and 
  * deem a PE to exist in various circumstances, including those relating to the presence of substantial equipment in the contracting state and the time spent by personnel of an enterprise furnishing services in a contracting state. 




# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
General deduction provisions provide that all losses and expenditures, to the extent incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing that income, are allowable deductions. However, the general deduction provisions do not allow a deduction to the extent a loss or expenditure is an outgoing of capital, or of a capital, private, or domestic nature, or incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income.
## Depreciation
Depreciation is allowed for equipment and other assets at prescribed rates. A taxpayer must use the diminishing-value method unless an election is made to use the prime-cost method. The applicable diminishing-value rates are 150% of the prime-cost rates.
### Plant, machinery, and equipment
Plant, machinery, and equipment (including buildings) are depreciable at rates according to their estimated lives. A taxpayer other than a taxpayer who derives income from mining, petroleum, or gas operations may elect to claim special accelerated depreciation rates for certain capital items. For example, flexible depreciation rates (up to 100%) may be claimed on new industrial plant with a life exceeding five years that is used for manufacturing purposes. Other new plant and articles used in manufacturing, construction, transport, storage, communication, and agricultural production are eligible for an accelerated deduction equal to 20% of cost in the year of purchase. New plant and articles used for tourism are eligible for an accelerated deduction equal to 55% of cost in the year of purchase.
### Motor vehicles
Motor vehicles are generally depreciable at 20% of prime cost. There is no upper limit in value for depreciation purposes.
### Buildings
Buildings forming an integral part of plant, machinery, and equipment are depreciable at a prime-cost rate of up to 7.5%, depending on the construction materials. Buildings housing plants eligible for the one-year write-off deduction (_see comments on new industrial plant under Plant, machinery, and equipment above_) can be written off in the year of construction. Other income-producing buildings may qualify for the accelerated deduction of 20% in the year of purchase.
### Agricultural and fishing plants
Most items of new agricultural and commercial fishing plants qualify for 100% depreciation, as do boats and ships, including ancillary equipment, used solely as dive boats or for scuba diving by accredited tour operators. Other new items having a life exceeding five years used by a person carrying on agricultural operations are eligible for accelerated depreciation in the initial year of use.
## Goodwill
A deduction is not available for goodwill or the amortisation of goodwill in Papua New Guinea (this being an amount not deductible under ordinary concepts and an item for which there is no specific deduction provision).
## Start-up expenses
It will generally be the case that start-up expenses will not be deductible in Papua New Guinea. Such expenses are generally either capital, or of a capital nature, or incurred prior to the derivation of assessable income. There is no specific deduction provision for the deductibility of start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
A deduction is generally available for interest incurred on an arm’s-length basis, subject to meeting the general principles for deductibility and the requirements under the thin capitalisation rules (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_). Where interest is incurred in connection with the construction or acquisition of a plant or capital asset, that interest is not immediately deductible. Rather, such interest is deemed to form part of the cost of that asset (and in the case of a plant will then form part of the base from which future depreciation deductions may be claimed).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible if they have previously been included in assessable income and written off by year-end or if the bad debt was in respect of money lent in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business of money lending.
## Double deductions
An additional amount equal to the actual amount of expenditure incurred is deductible in respect of certain expenditures (e.g. export market development costs, certain donations). In other words, a ‘double deduction’ is available with respect to these items.
### Donations
It is considered that donations made by a corporate taxpayer meet the general principles for deductibility and hence will generally be deductible (notwithstanding the specific provision dealing with gifts to charitable bodies has no current effect as there are no charitable bodies approved by the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue for this purpose). There are specific provisions in Papua New Guinea’s taxation law dealing with the deductibility of certain donations, some of which provide a deduction for up to 200% of the value of the amount donated.
## Pension expenses
Contributions paid to an authorised superannuation fund are tax-deductible to the extent that they do not exceed 15% of the relevant employee’s gross taxable salary. Contributions to non-resident funds are not tax-deductible. _See the section for more information_.
## Taxes
A deduction is not allowable in respect of payments of income tax. Other taxes may be deductible, subject to meeting the general principles for deductibility.
## Net operating losses
### Domestic
Trading losses may be offset against all income received in the same accounting period or carried forward and offset against future trading profits. The limitation period on the carryforward of losses is generally 20 years. Losses may not be carried back against prior years’ profits. Primary production losses and resource project losses may be carried forward without a time limitation, although, again, they may not be carried back (_see the section for more information_).
Note that the carryforward of losses is subject to a 50% or more continuity of shareholding and control test, or a continuity of business test where there is a breach of the ownership test.
### Foreign
Losses incurred by a resident taxpayer from a source outside Papua New Guinea (other than in relation to export market development) are not deductible against assessable income derived within Papua New Guinea. In practice, overseas losses can be carried forward and offset against overseas income for up to 20 years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The deduction available to a taxpayer for management fees paid to an associated person is limited to the greater of:
  * 2% of assessable income derived from PNG sources by the taxpayer or 
  * 2% of the total allowable deductions, excluding management fees incurred by the taxpayer in Papua New Guinea. 


The limitation applies to both resident and non-resident taxpayers. Special rules apply to mining, petroleum, and gas companies. These limits may not apply where the recipient of the management fee is resident in a country with which Papua New Guinea has a DTT or where it can be demonstrated that the management fee arrangements do not have the purposes or effect of avoiding or altering the income tax payable in Papua New Guinea.


# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Companies are assessed for CIT separately, regardless of whether they are part of a group of associated or related companies. Losses of one company within a group cannot be offset for tax purposes against the profits of another company within that group.
The Companies Act allows two or more companies to amalgamate and continue as one, and provisions are in place to allow this to occur without any adverse CIT consequences.
## Transfer pricing
Papua New Guinea has transfer pricing provisions that require transactions with foreign affiliates to be conducted on an arm's-length basis. Disclosure of such transactions is done through an international dealings schedule (IDS). Corporate taxpayers (including companies, superannuation funds, and unit trusts) that have transactions or dealings with international affiliates that exceed PGK 100,000 in an income year or have aggregate loan balances with international affiliates in excess of PGK 2 million at any time during an income year are required to prepare and lodge an IDS with their income tax return for that year of income.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules apply to prevent taxpayers from incurring excessive levels of debt. By excessively gearing their investments, companies are able to claim greater tax deductions through the interest expense charged on such debt. Thin capitalisation rules typically feature a debt-to-equity ratio that governs the ratio by which companies can borrow from related parties relative to their equity. Any interest charged on debt that exceeds this ratio will not be deductible for CIT purposes.
Papua New Guinea's thin capitalisation rules apply a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1 for all PNG companies. Note that the 2020 Budget amended the ratio of resources companies from 3:1 to 2:1 effective immediately. We understand that the intention of parliament was that this reduction would apply from 1 January 2021; however, legislative amendments will be required in 2020 to give effect to this intent.
These rules do not apply to licensed financial institutions and do not apply to interest paid under domestic debt for non-resource companies. If the ratio is breached, a proportion of the interest on foreign debt will be denied as a tax deduction. For resource companies, a proportion of interest on all debt will be denied.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Papua New Guinea does not have CFC rules.


# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Income derived by a non-resident contractor for services in Papua New Guinea is usually subject to a WHT at the rate of 15% of gross income. The provisions extend to payments for the following:
  * The installation, maintenance, and use in Papua New Guinea of substantial equipment or machinery. 
  * Construction projects. 
  * For the lease or charter of any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or any machinery or vehicle. 
  * Consultancy or management services. 


Where the non-resident contractor rules do not apply, the non-resident company will be subject to income tax at the non-resident tax rate of 48% on its PNG-sourced taxable income (_see the section for a definition of taxable income_).
PNG branch remittances are not liable for dividend WHT or any branch profits or similar tax.


# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
In this section, we comment on the more significant tax credits and incentives available in Papua New Guinea, followed by a summary of those with more limited application.
## Foreign tax credit
A foreign tax credit may be available to offset foreign tax paid against PNG tax payable. The foreign tax credit is limited to either the foreign tax paid or the average PNG tax payable on that foreign income, whichever is less. There is no mechanism to carry forward excess foreign tax credits for utilisation in a subsequent year.
## Primary production incentives
Key incentives that are available with specific application to primary production activities include:
  * Outright deductions for certain capital expenditures, including clearing, preparing, or conserving land for agriculture; eradicating pests; providing labourers’ accommodation; and for the conservation and conveyance of water.
  * A 100% deduction is available for a new plant used directly for the purposes of agricultural production, and an initial 20% accelerated depreciation deduction is allowed for a new plant with a life exceeding five years.
  * Losses incurred in carrying on a primary production business can be carried forward for 20 years.
  * Agricultural companies may transfer to their shareholders the benefit of the outright tax deduction available for many types of capital expenditures. The total deduction available to shareholders may not exceed the amounts paid on their shares.
  * As part of promoting investment in primary production, a 20% tax rate is prescribed in respect of ‘incentive rate primary production income’ derived by a company (as opposed to the normal 30% tax rate for a resident company or 48% for a non-resident company) for up to ten years.


## Agricultural production extension services deduction
A 150% deduction is available for expenditure on services provided free of charge to smallholder growers, including the provision of advice, training, and technical assistance in relation to primary production to assist growers with production, processing, packaging, and marketing issues.
## Double deduction for export market development costs
Expenditure incurred in the promotion for sale outside Papua New Guinea of goods manufactured in Papua New Guinea or tourism promotion is eligible for double deduction. The total tax saving cannot exceed 75% of the expenditure incurred.
## Export incentives
Prior to 1 January 2015, the net export income from the export sale of certain types of goods was exempt for the first four years of income, with a partial exemption in the following three years. This exemption is not applicable from 1 January 2015 (except in respect of goods that qualified for the exemption prior to that date).
## Tax credit for infrastructure development by agricultural, mining, petroleum, and gas companies
A tax credit is available to agricultural, mining, petroleum, gas, and certain tourism companies that incur expenditure on a prescribed infrastructure development. The credit is limited to 2% of the assessable income or the amount of tax payable for the year (in respect of that mining, petroleum, or gas project), whichever is less. Excess expenditure over the 2% or tax payable may be included in the following year’s rebate claim. Unutilised credits or excess expenditure can generally be carried forward for up to seven years from the year it was incurred. 
A prescribed infrastructure development includes a school, aid post, hospital road, and other capital assets that have been approved as such by the Department of National Planning and the IRC. It cannot be an expenditure required under the Mining Act or the Oil and Gas Act.
## Other tax incentives in Papua New Guinea
Other tax incentives available in Papua New Guinea include:
  * Manufacturers’ wage subsidy.
  * Immediate deduction for the costs of acquiring and installing solar heating plant.
  * A ten-year tax exemption for qualifying new business located in prescribed remote areas of Papua New Guinea.
  * A specific deduction for environmental protection and clean-up costs.


## Incentives for petroleum, mining, and gas operations
Special incentives and rules apply to mining, petroleum, and gas exploration, extraction, and production activities. The main aspects are as follows:
### Project basis of assessment
A project basis of assessment (ring-fencing) is adopted for all resource projects. This means losses from other operations, regardless of whether or not they are resource related, cannot generally be offset against resource project income from a particular ring-fenced project. However, there are some concessions to the ring-fencing principle in respect of exploration expenditure and expenditure in respect of discontinued projects and losses arising from site restoration costs.
In general, all costs incurred in the exploration and development phases of the project are accumulated and amortised over the life of the project. Once production starts, an immediate deduction is allowed for 'normal' operating and administration expenses. Capital expenditure incurred after the start of production are capitalised and amortised over the life of the project.
### Rate of tax
A standardised rate of 30% applies to all companies resident in Papua New Guinea.
### Interest deductions
Interest is not deductible prior to the commencement of a resource project. Following the issue of a resource development licence, a person carrying on a resource project or exploration in relation to a resource project may claim a deduction against resource income for interest on money borrowed for carrying on the relevant operations or exploration. This is subject to a number of conditions, including the resource company maintaining a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1 (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
### Capital allowances
Allowable exploration expenditures (AEE) are amortised over the life of the resource project. The deduction is calculated by dividing the unamortised balance by either the remaining life of the project or four, whichever is less. The amount of the deduction is limited to the amount of income remaining after deducting all other deductions, other than deductions for allowable capital expenditure. In other words, the deduction cannot create a tax loss.
Allowable capital expenditures (ACE) are amortised over the life of the resource project. The ACE is split into two categories: capital expenditures with an estimated effective life of more than ten years (long-life ACE) and capital expenditures with an estimated effective life of less than ten years (short-life ACE).
The annual deduction for long-life ACE is claimed on a straight-line basis over ten years.
Where the remaining life of the project is less than ten years, the rate at which the deduction is allowed is calculated by referring to the remaining life of the project. For short-life ACE, the annual deduction is calculated by dividing the unamortised balance by either the remaining life of the project or four, whichever is less. For new mining projects, the deductions for both long-life ACE and short-life ACE are calculated by dividing the unamortised balance by either the remaining life of the project or four, whichever is less.
The amount of the deduction for ACE is limited to the amount of income remaining after deducting all other deductions. In other words, the deduction cannot create a tax loss.
### Off-licence exploration expenditure
A major easing of the ring-fencing principle applies to taxpayers that are involved in a producing project where the taxpayer or a related party incurs exploration expenditure outside the area of the productive project. In this situation, the taxpayer can elect (whether or not it is currently involved in a producing project) to add such exploration expenditure to an exploration pool that can be amortised against income from the producing project.
The amount allowable as a deduction from this exploration pool in respect of resource operations carried on by the taxpayer or a related corporation is the lesser of:
  * 25% of the total undeducted balance of expenditure in the exploration pool or
  * such amount as reduces CIT (other than additional profits tax _[see below]_) that would, but for this deduction, be payable by the taxpayer and its related corporations in respect of those resource operations for that year of income, by 10% (or 25% for mining projects).


### Management fees
Once a resource project derives assessable income, the deduction for management fees is restricted to 2% of operating expenses other than management fees. During the exploration phase of a project, the amount of management fees that can be treated as allowable exploration expenditure is limited to 2% of the exploration expenditure other than management fees. Furthermore, during the development phase, the amount of management fees that can be treated as allowable capital expenditure is limited to 2% of the allowable capital expenditure other than management fees.
### Transfer of expenditure
When interests are transferred from one taxpayer to another, the vendor and purchaser can agree to transfer deduction entitlements for the unamortised balances of allowable exploration expenditure and allowable capital expenditure to the purchaser.
### Liquefied natural gas (LNG) project
A number of provisions with specific application to the PNG LNG project have been included in the Income Tax Act, Stamp Duties Act, Goods and Services Tax Act, Customs Act, and Excise Act.
### Additional profits tax
A modified additional profits tax applies to all resource projects (mining, petroleum, and gas). The additional profits tax applies a tax rate of 30% to returns in excess of a 15% hurdle rate.

Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
## Dividends, interest, royalties, and technical/management fees
The following WHT rates apply to dividends, interest, royalties, and technical fees under PNG domestic law and tax treaties. PNG domestic legislation provides an exemption from WHT for dividends and interest in certain circumstances. The higher rates quoted are the maximum rates allowable under the treaties.

Notes
  1. There is no WHT on interest when: 
     * interest is paid or credited to a licensed financial institution in Papua New Guinea, the Bank of Papua New Guinea, or the state, or 
     * the interest income is otherwise exempt income in the hands of the recipient. 
  2. A royalty paid to a non-resident associate of the payee will suffer a 30% WHT. Where the non-resident is not an associate of the payee, the WHT rate will be 10% (or 48% of the taxable income derived from the royalty if the non-resident chooses to lodge an income tax return in Papua New Guinea). 
  3. The treaty with Germany has not yet been ratified by Germany. 


## Business income WHT
Income derived by local contractors in certain industries is covered by the business income WHT regime. The industries affected include:
  * Building and construction. 
  * Road transport. 
  * Motor vehicle repairs. 
  * Security. 
  * Equipment hire. 


Businesses affected are required to have a certificate of compliance and to produce it when entering into contracts with their customers. Payers are required to file an annual income reporting statement where they make either an eligible payment of PGK 500 or more in relation to one contract or eligible payments for several contracts exceeding PGK 5,000 in the year of income in relation to a single payee. Payers are required to deduct a 10% WHT if payees do not produce a certificate of compliance.
## Non-resident insurer WHT
Premiums paid to non-resident insurers in respect of insurance contracts on property situated in Papua New Guinea or insured events that can only occur in Papua New Guinea are subject to tax in Papua New Guinea. The tax is calculated on a deemed taxable income equal to 10% of the gross premium, which is taxed at the non-resident tax rates of 48% (companies) or 30% (unincorporated associations). Tax treaties may limit the rate of tax applied.


# Papua New Guinea
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Taxable income is defined as the sum of assessable income minus allowable deductions. In practice, profits are calculated for tax purposes by reference to the profits reported in the financial accounts. Accounts must be prepared in accordance with PNG accounting principles, which follow the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
## Inventory valuation
There is no form of stock relief or trading stock valuation adjustment to recognise the effects of inflation in Papua New Guinea. There is a once-only option to adopt the lowest of the cost amount, the market selling value, or the replacement value (which, in practice, may mean that book and tax valuations for trading stock are not aligned). Where the option is not exercised, the value of the stock is deemed to be the cost price; however, neither the income tax law nor the associated regulations provide detailed guidance on what constitutes 'cost price' (the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue has not produced any related guidance to date). It will generally be the case that where a taxpayer has determined a cost price in accordance with IFRS, that cost price will also be accepted for income tax purposes.
In special circumstances, the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue may accept a lower valuation.
## Capital gains
There is no general capital gains tax in Papua New Guinea. However, profits arising on the sale of property acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit, or from the carrying out of a profit-making scheme, are taxable as ordinary income.
## Dividend income
Unless otherwise exempt from CIT, dividends are included in the assessable income of a shareholder.
### Inter-company dividends
Dividends received by a resident company from other companies, whether resident or non-resident, while being assessable to tax, are generally subject to a full tax rebate and are effectively received tax-free. However, where a company has losses on other activities or losses carried over from earlier years, those losses are applied against dividend income before the calculation of the dividend rebate.
### Stock dividends
In most cases, the payment of a dividend by way of the issue of shares is subject to the same taxation treatment as the payment of a dividend by way of cash or the distribution of other property. However, dividends paid by the issue of shares wholly and exclusively out of profits arising from the sale or revaluation of assets not acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit are exempt from income tax and dividends WHT.
## Interest income
Unless exempt under specific provisions, interest paid or credited by a financial institution, the Central Bank, or a company to a person resident in Papua New Guinea is includable in income, and the person making the payment of or crediting interest in the account is liable to withhold and pay tax upon the amount.
## Royalty income
Tax is imposed on royalties and similar payments made to non-residents who do not have a PE in Papua New Guinea. The tax must be withheld by the payer on behalf of the payee and remitted to the IRC. The tax payable on royalties paid to a party who is not an ‘associated person’ is the lesser of:
  * 48% of the net royalty (i.e. gross royalty, less applicable expenses), and 
  * 10% of the gross royalty. 


Royalty payments to a non-resident ‘associated person’ are liable for a WHT of 30% of gross payments (subject to any DTT), with no option to adopt the net income basis.
The definition of ‘associated person’ is detailed and widely drawn. Broadly, it encompasses relatives, partners, companies under effective common control, and related trust interests.
There is also a 5% WHT on mining, petroleum, timber, and fishing royalties to landowners.
## Partnership income
A partner’s share of the assessable income of the partnership less all allowable deductions to the partnership is includable in the partner’s assessable income for the year of income. Likewise, the partner’s individual interest in a partnership loss incurred in the year of income is an allowable deduction. Further, if income is exempt income to the partnership, this income will be exempt income to the individual partner relative to their individual interest.
## Unrealised exchange gains/losses
Generally, foreign exchange gains realised and derived from debts made on or after 11 November 1986 or denominated in a currency other than the Papua New Guinea kina are included in assessable income.
## Foreign income
PNG resident companies are liable for CIT on their income from all sources (i.e. including foreign-sourced income). A foreign tax credit may be available to offset foreign tax paid against PNG tax payable (_see the section for more information_).
There are no provisions in Papua New Guinea that permit the deferral of the taxation of income derived outside Papua New Guinea. Subject to the operation of a DTT, foreign-sourced income derived by a resident of Papua New Guinea is subject to tax in Papua New Guinea in the year in which it is derived, irrespective of whether or not that income is repatriated to Papua New Guinea.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
PNG resident companies are liable for income tax on their worldwide income. Companies that are not resident in Papua New Guinea are only required to remit tax on income sourced in Papua New Guinea. A non-resident’s PNG-sourced passive income, including dividends, interest, and royalties, may be subject to WHT. It is ordinarily the case that the payer of the dividend, interest, or royalty must withhold the relevant amount of the tax and remit this to PNG’s Internal Revenue Commission (IRC).
Papua New Guinea levies corporate income tax (CIT) on companies on a flat rate basis.
Generally, trading profits and other income (except income that is specifically exempt) of resident companies in Papua New Guinea are assessed tax at a rate of 30%, whereas non-resident companies operating in Papua New Guinea are assessed tax at a rate of 48%.
The most recent budget also introduced a new income tax rate to apply to commercial banks. These entities will be subject to tax at the rate of 45%. 
## Overseas shippers
Income derived by overseas shippers or charterers carrying passengers, livestock, mail, or goods out of Papua New Guinea is taxable in Papua New Guinea. The tax is calculated on a deemed taxable income equal to 5% of the gross income, which is taxable at the non-resident rate of 48% in the case of companies. The IRC may exempt the overseas shipper from tax if the shipper’s home country exempts PNG shippers from a similar tax.
## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or local income taxes in Papua New Guinea.

## Goods and services tax (GST)
The GST rate is 10% and applies to most goods and services supplied in Papua New Guinea. Exported goods and services attract a zero rate of GST. The supply of some goods and services are exempt, including medical, educational, and financial services. Land is excluded from GST, but buildings and other improvements are subject to the tax.
An import GST deferral scheme is also available. Taxpayers wishing to participate in the import deferral scheme are required to apply for approval by the IRC and must have a good history of tax compliance in order to qualify.
Directors of companies that fail to comply with GST obligations are personally liable for a penalty equal to the outstanding tax liability that the company ought to have remitted to the IRC.
## Customs duties
The majority of manufacturing inputs (including plant and machinery) attract no customs duties, and other customs duty rates are being progressively reduced. The remaining rates for customs duties vary depending on the nature of the good being imported and are assessed on the total value of the goods imported, including cost, insurance, and freight (CIF). Customs bonds may be issued for the temporary importation of goods that are to be re-exported within 12 months.
## Excise taxes
Although customs duties are now minimal in many cases, some goods, most notably motor vehicles, now attract excise tax. Private motor vehicles can attract excise tax of up to 40%, whereas work vehicles attract excise tax of 10%. Excise taxes can also apply to some domestically produced goods, including refined fuel products, alcohol, and tobacco. The tobacco excise tax is increased 5% biannually (10% annually).
## Land tax
Land tax is imposed annually by provincial governments on the unimproved value of the land, and the power to levy land tax is vested exclusively with the provincial governments. In Papua New Guinea, land tax is difficult to implement and faces major geographical and social problems.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duty applies at varying rates on documents and certain transactions. Of particular note is duty charged on the conveyance of property, which rises to a maximum of 5% where the value of the property being transferred exceeds 100,000 PNG kina (PGK). The duty is payable by the purchaser, and a 5% duty on the unencumbered value of land may also be payable where there is a transfer of shares in certain landholding companies.
Other dutiable transactions include share transfers (including some share buy-backs), which are subject to a rate of 1%. The Collector of Stamp Duties has the power to amend assessments and refund overpayments of stamp duty.
The Stamp Duties Act was amended to implement a rental income compliance system. The amendment effectively makes it compulsory for a landlord to provide their Taxation Identification Number (TIN) on lease documents, as lease documents will not otherwise be stamped.
Stamp duty is payable on documents executed outside Papua New Guinea that relate to property or matters done or to be done in Papua New Guinea.
## Export duties
### Timber
Export duty on timber logs (not sawn timber or plantation logs) is calculated with reference to the freight on board (FOB) value per cubic metre of exported logs and rates that increase as the value of the exported logs increase.
### Spices
Levies are imposed from time to time on the export of specified spices (e.g. vanilla).
## Payroll taxes
### Salary or wages tax (SWT)
Businesses paying salary or wages to employees are required to withhold SWT (calculated at the prescribed marginal rates) and remit to the IRC on the seventh day of the month following the month of payment.
Salary or wages is defined as remuneration paid to employees in cash or kind, including benefits such as accommodation and transportation.
Normal employment-related receipts and benefits also include any remuneration paid as consultancy fees or fees for professional services, where the remuneration is paid wholly or substantially for personal services performed in Papua New Guinea.
Directors are personally liable for any unpaid SWT obligations of their companies. Directors who fail to ensure their company complies with its SWT reporting obligations may be penalised at a rate of 20% of the unpaid tax liability _per annum_. After three months of non-payment of outstanding SWT, directors will not be able to obtain a remission of penalties imposed.
## Contributions to employee superannuation funds
Contributions to employee superannuation funds are compulsory for entities with 15 or more permanent employees. The employer’s compulsory contribution is 8.4% of each employee’s gross basic salary. The employee’s minimum contribution is 6.0%.
Membership is generally compulsory for citizens. Non-citizens are currently exempt; however, this is under continuing review.
Contributions must be paid to an authorised superannuation fund. Contributions paid to an authorised fund are tax-deductible to the extent that they do not exceed 15% of the relevant employee’s gross taxable salary. Contributions to non-resident funds are not tax-deductible.
## Training levy
The training levy is abolished effective from 1 January 2018.
Previously, all businesses whose annual payroll exceeded PGK 200,000 were subject to a 2% training levy, calculated on the sum of the taxable salaries, including benefits, of all personnel. Qualifying expenses incurred in training PNG citizen employees were creditable up to the actual amount of the levy. The training levy, if payable, was not tax-deductible.
## Departure tax
A departure tax is collected by airlines issuing tickets for persons departing Papua New Guinea.
## Gaming machine tax
Papua New Guinea imposes a 74% tax on gross revenue from gaming machines.
## Resource project production levies
Production royalties of 2% are payable to the national government on the net smelter return from mining operations. These royalties are tax-deductible. A royalty, at the rate of 2% of the wellhead value, is also payable from the production of petroleum and gas operations. Holders of new petroleum development licences are entitled to treat royalties as income tax paid. However, new petroleum projects will also pay a tax-deductible development levy calculated at the same rate of 2% of the wellhead value.
Mining projects are also required to pay a production levy to the Mineral Resources Authority calculated at a rate between 0.25% and 0.5% of the assessable income from production.
