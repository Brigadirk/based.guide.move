## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
According to law, the fiscal year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The filing deadline for the income tax return is generally the first week of April. The system is one of self-assessment, but the tax return filed with the tax authorities is subject to review.
## Payment of tax
Income tax payments are due in 12 monthly instalments (advanced payments). The due date for the final income tax payment for a year is generally the first week of April.
The estimated payment calculation system has been established, and the amount of the estimated payment will be the greater of the result of multiplying the net revenue of the month by (i) 1.5% or (ii) the applicable coefficient. The coefficient is calculated by dividing the income generated in the previous fiscal year by the income tax that was determined.
### Moratorium interests
According to the Peruvian tax legislation, the SUNAT applies a moratorium interest rate of 0.03% for each delayed day for payment of tax debts (0.9% per month).
Beginning 2024, the moratorium interests related to fines are calculated using the legal interest rate.
## Tax authority
The National Superintendency of Customs and Tax Administration (SUNAT) is responsible for administering all of the aforementioned taxes (income tax, VAT, etc.). Companies resident in Peru must be registered with the tax administration (Taxpayer’s Registry).
The Tax Court is a specialised administrative tribunal, which depends on the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but is otherwise autonomous regarding its specific functions. Its mission is to rule over tax controversies that may arise between the tax administration and the taxpayers, by interpreting and applying the corresponding tax legislation, issuing mandatory observance jurisprudence, and establishing homogenous criteria that continue to support the progress of the tax system.
Finally, taxpayers are entitled to file an appeal before the Judiciary (Court) against resolutions issued by the Tax Court, but payment of the tax debt must be performed or guarantees must be provided.
## Tax audit process
The tax audit performed by the SUNAT includes all the aspects of the tax and period being subject to review. The tax audit is formal, and the process is fully regulated.
The SUNAT is also able to conduct partial audits of limited scope.
## Statute of limitations
Pursuant to the Peruvian tax legislation, the SUNAT is entitled to audit taxpayers in order to assess their tax liabilities, request the payment of any due tax, and assess any applicable penalty for up to (i) four years from 1 January of the year following the date the corresponding tax return had to be filed, (ii) six years to the extent that the corresponding tax return was not filed, and (iii) ten years when the tax withheld by the taxpayer has not been paid to the SUNAT.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The SUNAT mainly focuses on the following topics:
  * Deduction of expenses, including cost share expenses.
  * Market value of transactions between related parties.
  * Peruvian source income WHT.
  * Income tax advance payments.


## General Anti-avoidance Rule (GAAR)
The GAAR (provision XVI of the Tax Code) allows the SUNAT to consider the acts, situations, and economic activities performed, established, or desired by the taxpayers in order to determine the real nature of the taxable event. To this extent, provision XVI establishes that when tax evasion is detected, the SUNAT is entitled to collect the tax debt and fines; reduce the amount of balances due, NOLs, or tax credits; or eliminate any tax advantage, without prejudice, to recover any amount that was wrongfully reimbursed.
While interpreting the tax legislation, substance should be selected over a legal form. The fact that a taxpayer's transactions are legal does not imply that they are acceptable with reference to the underlying meaning embedded in the tax rules. Thus, where there is no business purpose except to obtain a tax benefit, the SUNAT should challenge such transactions as artificial and apply the corresponding tax rules.
In 2014, provision XVI was partially suspended until regulations that would establish their scope and application were enacted by the Peruvian government. Until this day, the tax administration was only empowered to disregard simulated transactions.
However, Legislative Decree 1422 was enacted on 13 September 2018, establishing that the SUNAT is authorised to review the operations carried out since the publication of provision XVI once the regulations are published. Likewise, the presumption of fraudulent behaviour, serious negligence, or abuse of powers was incorporated to the legal representatives when they collaborate with the design, approval, or execution of situations that could be subject to the GAAR.
At the same time, it was established as a non-delegable faculty of the Board of Directors to approve the operations carried out by the company in the framework of tax planning. In summary, directors can be held responsible if in a board meeting they approve acts, situations, or economic relations that prevent the correct payment of taxes in question or are aimed at obtaining a tax advantage.
This, nonetheless, has been challenged by the Peruvian Congress through a report submitted on 9 November 2018, requesting the repeal of the Board of Directors obligation to communicate operations related to provision XVI, as well as the SUNAT's faculty to review operations carried out upon the approval of the regulation that lifts the aforementioned suspension, and not (as Legislative Decree 1422 established) since 2012.
This report was approved on 4 December 2018, and it is possible that in the near future the obligations of the Board of Directors will be repealed with respect to provision XVI, as well as the retroactive application of the SUNAT's control power.
On 6 May 2019, parameters for the application of the GAAR contained in Norm XVI were approved, lifting the partial suspension of its effects as per the 2014 ruling.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
For income tax purposes, the following entities, among others, are considered as resident entities in Peru:
  * Corporations duly incorporated in Peru.
  * Branches, agencies, and PEs in Peru of non-resident individuals or entities.
  * Partnerships and limited liability companies.


## Permanent establishment (PE)
The following scenarios might trigger a PE presence in Peru:
  * Any fixed place of business in which the activities of a foreign Company are totally or partially carried out.
  * A building site or construction or installation project, as well as supervision activities related to them, when their duration exceeds 183 days within any 12 month period, unless a lower term has been established through a Double Tax Treaty. 
  * The provision of services, when they are performed in the country for the same project, service or for a related one, for a periodor periods that in total exceed 183 days within any 12 month period, unless a lower term has been established through a DoubleTax Treaty.
  * A person acting in the country on behalf of a foreign Company and, in doing so, habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are that are routinely concluded without material modification by the foreign Company.


PEs must comply with all the formal and substantial tax obligations of any domiciled taxpayer. If a PE presence is determined, then the tax contingency will have to be quantified by calculating the taxes, fines, and interest accrued as from the moment in which the PE presence can be deemed, except for the period barred by statute of limitations.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Acceptable payment methods
Obligations that are fulfilled through cash payments equal to or exceeding PEN 2,000 or USD 500 must be made via bank account deposits, wire transfers, payment orders, credit cards, non-negotiable cheques, or other means of payment provided by entities of the Peruvian financial system. In transactions with subjects that are qualified by the tax administration as subjects with ‘low‘ or ’very low‘ level of compliance, means of payment must be used starting at PEN 600 or USD 150. Failure to use one of these payment methods when such an obligation exists will result in the disallowance of deductions for any expenses or costs for income tax purposes and the disallowance of a credit for the corresponding VAT.
Payments shall be considered as valid payments for tax purposes if they are made directly to the creditor, supplier of the goods, or provider of services. Payments made to a third party shall be valid as long as they are previously communicated to the tax administration. 
Payments made through financial institutions that are residents in tax havens shall not be considered as valid payments.
## Expenses derived from transactions entered into with entities resident in tax havens
Certain expenses are not tax-deductible, including expenses incurred with respect to transactions with (i) entities resident in tax havens on the list attached to the PITL regulations, (ii) PEs located in tax havens, or (iii) entities that generate revenues or income through tax havens.
Nonetheless, expenses incurred from the following transactions are excluded from the above-mentioned limitations, provided the consideration paid falls within market value:
  * Interest on loans.
  * Insurance premiums.
  * Leases of aircraft or ships.
  * Maritime freight.
  * Fees for passing through the Panama Canal.


## Depreciation
Assets may be depreciated for tax purposes via the straight-line method, capped at the following rates, but without exceeding the amount of the financial depreciation:
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Cattle (both labour and reproduction) and fishing nets | 25  
Vehicles (except trains) and any kind of ovens | 20  
Machines and equipment used for mining, oil and construction activities, excluding furniture, household, and office goods | 20  
Equipment for data processing | 25  
Machines and equipment acquired as of 1 January 1991 | 10  
Other fixed assets | 10  
Buildings must be subject to a flat 5% depreciation rate, regardless of the financial depreciation.
Due to recent government dispositions, as from fiscal year 2023, buildings and constructions will be subject to a flat 33.33% depreciation rate, provided that the following requirements are met: (i) the construction has to be initiated as from 1 January 2023, and (ii) until 31 December 2024, the construction had a work progress of at least 80%.
Furthermore, hybrid or electric land transportation vehicles (except trains), acquired in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, used for the production of taxable income, may be subject to a 50% depreciation rate.
Due to the State of Emergency, the Legislative Decree No. 1488 also established a special and temporary depreciation regime for buildings and constructions, and other type of assets, provided that they met certain conditions. 
## Amortisation of intangible assets
The amortisation of property rights, trademarks, patents, and manufacturing procedures, as well as other similar intangible assets, are not deductible for income tax purposes. However, the price paid for intangible assets of a limited duration, at the taxpayer's choice, may be considered as an expense and applied to the results in a single year or amortised proportionally over a ten-year term.
The Peruvian tax administration, prior to an opinion from the corresponding technical organism, is permitted to determine the real value of those intangible assets for tax purposes when the price does not reflect the real one.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisation expenses, pre-operating expenses (including initial operations and further expansion of operations), and interest accrued during the pre-operating period may be expensed in the first period of operation or amortised using the straight-line method over a maximum of ten years. However, once a company has elected to recover start-up costs via the straight-line method, it may revoke such election only upon receiving approval of the tax authorities.
## Interest expenses
In general terms, interest on loans and related expenses are deductible, provided they are related to the acquisition of goods or services incurred, or to be incurred, in order to obtain or produce taxable income or to maintain the source of such income.
In the case of loans entered into between related and non-related parties, the amount of interest to be deducted is limited to interest from indebtedness not exceeding 30% of the tax EBITDA of the previous fiscal year (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
## Bad debts
Write-offs of bad debts and equitable provisions are deductible, provided that the accounts to which they belong are determined. For the provisions of bad debts, it is necessary that:
  * there is a debt due and the taxpayer can provide evidence of the financial difficulties of the debtor that could foresee a risk in the collection of the debt, and
  * the provision is registered separately in the inventory and balance book at the fiscal year closing. In this sense, a generic bad debt provision will not be deductible in the assessment of the net taxable income, nor will bad debts whose terms have not yet elapsed.


Bear in mind that the following debts are not considered bad debts:
  * Debts incurred between related parties.
  * Debts guaranteed by banks or financial companies by means of rights over real property, money deposits, or purchase-sale agreements with reservation of right of legal ownership.
  * Debts that have been subject to renewal or express extension.


## Charitable contributions
Donations made to entities of the public sector, except companies, and to non-profit associations with certain purposes are deductible, provided that the receiver of the donation is duly qualified by the tax administration.
The deduction will be limited to 10% of the net income of the donor and only during the fiscal year in which it is granted (carryforward of the donation is disallowed). This means that if the donor does not obtain taxable income in the fiscal year in which the donation is made, no deduction will be available.
In addition, companies can deduct the expenses for the food they donate. This donation requires the food to no longer have commercial value and be apt for human consumption. The deduction cannot exceed 1.5% of the total sales that the donor makes.
## Profit sharing
Entities with more than 20 employees, provided they obtain taxable income during the fiscal year, must distribute a percentage (5%, 8%, or 10% depending on the industry) of their profits (the basis is the tax profit of the fiscal year) among their employees. The amount of distribution for each employee depends on the effective working days during the year and annual remuneration.
## Employee’s retributions and health insurance premiums
Employee’s retributions paid during a fiscal year may be deducted in such year, provided the payments are made by the employer before the term to file its annual income tax return expires. Likewise, health insurance premiums for employees, their spouses, and children are deductible.
For fiscal years 2024 and 2025, employers that contract employees that are between 18 years and 29 years old can obtain an additional deduction equivalent to 50% of their retribution, provided certain requirements are met.
## Vehicle expenses deductions
Vehicle expenses may be deducted, provided the vehicles are essential to a company’s business activities and are continually used for such purpose. There is a limitation on the tax deductibility of car expenses used for administrative of representation purposes, depending on the amount of income generated by the company. The number of company cars assigned to directors, managers, and representatives of a company may not exceed five under any circumstances.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for income tax purposes.
## Taxes
Other taxes assessable on properties and activities generating taxable income are deductible for income tax purposes.
## Net operating losses (NOLs)
Tax losses may be offset according to either of the following systems:
  * Against net income generated within the following four fiscal years after the year in which the loss is incurred. Any losses that are not offset within such period may not be carried forward to any future year (system A).
  * Against 50% of the net income generated in the following fiscal years after the year in which the loss was generated. Under this system, there is no time limitation for carrying forward the losses (system B).


After choosing one of the aforementioned systems, the taxpayer will not be able to change the system until the accumulated tax losses from prior fiscal years are exhausted. Losses will not be carried back to years prior to the year in which the loss is generated.
## Payments to foreign companies
Payments in favour of non-domiciled beneficiaries may be deducted as a cost or expense in the fiscal year in which they correspond to the extent that they have been effectively paid or credited within the term established to file the annual tax return (for the year in which they were incurred). Expenses that are not deducted in the fiscal year to which they correspond will be deductible in the fiscal year in which they are effectively paid, even if they have been registered in a previous fiscal year.
## Expenses derived from transactions entered into with subjects without operational capacity
As a general rule, invoices issued by subjects without operational capacity do not grant tax credit or any other right or benefit derived from VAT or support costs or expenses for income tax purposes.
A subject without operational capacity is the one who appears as the issuer of the invoice, but does not have the economic, financial, material, human, and/or other resources, or these are not suitable, to carry out the operations indicated in the invoice.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Group taxation is prohibited in Peru.
## Transfer pricing
Transactions between related parties and those entered into with parties domiciled in tax havens are subject to transfer pricing rules.
The existence of the transactions between related parties determine the application of specific valuation methods, which are established in the Income Tax law.
The rules related to market value and transfer pricing establish that, in any kind of transaction, the value assigned to the goods and services must be the market value for tax purposes. If such value differs from the market value, either by overvaluation or sub-valuation, the tax administration will proceed to adjust it for both the purchaser and the seller, even when one of them is a non-domiciled entity, provided that the value agreed to results in a lower tax than the one that would have applied if transfer pricing rules had been applied. The adjustment will be imputed in the taxable period in which the operations with related parties were performed.
In case of transactions between related parties or those entered with tax havens, the market value will be equivalent to the value agreed with independent parties in similar transactions, being mandatory to support such value with a transfer pricing study.
The law states that transfer pricing rules will not apply for VAT purposes.
### Benefit test requirement
The benefit test must be accomplished when a domiciled entity receives a service rendered by any of its related parties. Such test is considered complied with when the rendered service provides economic or commercial value to the recipient of the service, improving or maintaining its commercial position, which occurs if independent parties have satisfied the need for the service. The providers’ cost structure must be proved.
If the domiciled entity complies successfully with the benefit requirement test, then the deduction of the cost or expense incurred for the services rendered would be accepted. Low value services must not exceed the margin of 5%.
### Formal obligations
New formal obligations have been approved. Such obligations are the following informative tax returns:
  * Local report: Mandatory for taxpayers whose accrued income in the taxable year exceeded 2,300 tax units. They must provide information of transactions that generate taxable income and deductible costs/expenses.
  * Master report: Mandatory for companies that are part of a group with profits higher than 20,000 tax units, and companies that would have performed transactions within the scope of transfer pricing rules, whose amount of operations is equal to or higher than 400 tax units. They must give information regarding the organisational structure of the group, description of their business, their transfer pricing policies for intangibles and financing, and their financial and tax status.
  * Country-by-country (CbC) report: Mandatory for domiciled companies within a multinational group. They must provide information of the global distribution of profits, taxes paid, and business activities performed by each entity of the group in any country.


### Tax price adjustments
Adjustments to prices are only required whenever the price paid generates a higher tax deduction or a lower income tax in Peru; consequently, the existence of a tax prejudice will be required for an adjustment to be requested.
Adjustments are performed individually (on each operation) and not in an overall or global manner.
The adjustment of the value assigned by the tax administration or the taxpayer will be effective for both the transferor and the purchaser or transferee, without any constraints. In the case of non-domiciled parties, the bilateral adjustment will only proceed on transactions that could trigger taxable income in Peru and/or deductions for determining the income tax in Peru.
The adjustments are attributed to the corresponding tax period, according to the attribution rules depicted in the PITL (accrual regime for corporate taxpayers). However, when, under such rules, the adjustment cannot be attributed to a particular period, the adjustment will be allocated among all tax periods where income or expense has been allocated, in proportion.
Operations where no consideration has been paid are subject to transfer pricing rules. In this kind of transaction, the adjustment shall be allocated to the period or periods in which revenue would have accrued if consideration had been paid and the income was to be acknowledged by a domiciled taxpayer. On the other hand, if the income were to be recognised by a non-domiciled taxpayer, it would be attributed to the period or periods where the expenses accrued, even if it was a non-deductible expense, and the domiciled taxpayer would be responsible for payment.
### Commodities
There is a specific methodology for determining prices in the sales of internationally traded commodities to tax havens or intermediaries.
In this methodology, it is required to determine the price of the specified operation based on the international price without taking into account the particularities of each case.
## Thin capitalisation
According to the provisions of the PITL, the interest on debts and the expenses originated by the constitution, renewal, or cancellation of the same are considered as deductible expenses, provided that they have been contracted to acquire goods or services related to the obtaining or production of taxable income within the country or maintain its source of production.
As of 1 January 2021, thin capitalisation rules establish that net interest on the part that exceeds 30% of the EBITDA of the previous year will not be deductible ('Tax EBITDA rule'). For this purpose, EBITDA is understood to be the net income after compensation for losses plus net interest, depreciation, and amortisation.
Also note that the rule provides that net interests that could not have been deducted in the fiscal year due to exceeding the above-mentioned limit may be added to those corresponding to the next four fiscal years.
The aforementioned limit is not applicable to:
  1. Companies of the financial/banking and insurance system.
  2. Taxpayers whose net income in the taxable year is less than or equal to 2,500 tax units.
  3. Taxpayers who develop public infrastructure projects, public services, services related to these, applied research, and/or technological innovation that are carried out within the framework of the Legislative Decree of the Framework for the Promotion of Private Investment through Public-Private Associations and Asset Projects.
  4. Interest on debts for the development of public infrastructure projects, public services, services related to these, applied research, and/or technological innovation under the modality of Asset Projects within the framework of the Legislative Decree of the Framework for the Promotion of Private Investment through Public Private Associations and Active Projects
  5. Interest on indebtedness from the issuance of securities representing debt that meet certain conditions.


Interests indicated in (d) and (e) will be considered to calculate the legal limit. However, they will be deductible even if the amount exceeds the aforementioned limit.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
CFC rules are in force in order to avoid the deferral of income tax on passive income obtained from CFCs (defined as at least 50% of ownership, voting rights, or gains) by domiciled taxpayers, provided such companies are situated in tax havens or jurisdictions with nil or reduced tax rates.
## Taxation of indirect disposal of shares in Peruvian entities
Domiciled taxpayers are levied on their worldwide income, whereas non-domiciled taxpayers are levied only on their Peruvian-source income. Income obtained from the indirect transfer of shares issued by entities incorporated in Peru is deemed Peruvian-sourced. For such purposes, an indirect transfer of shares is deemed to exist when the shares of a non-domiciled entity, which in turn owns (directly or indirectly through other entities) shares issued by a domiciled entity, are transferred, provided the following two conditions are jointly met:
  * During the 12 months prior to transfer, the fair market value (FMV) of the shares of the Peruvian entity owned by the foreign entity equals 50% or more of the FMV of the shares of the foreign entity (the 50% test).
  * During any given 12-month period, shares representing 10% or more of the foreign entity’s share capital are transferred (the minimum rule).


Since 2019, an additional scenario for indirect transfer is included. An indirect transfer is considered when the total value of the shares of the domiciled entity being indirectly transferred is equal to or greater than 40,000 tax units. Such amount will be determined by applying the percentage obtained for the 50% test on the total value agreed for the sale of the shares transferred by the taxpayer and its related parties. 
The Regulations establish the methods by which the FMV of the shares will be calculated for purposes of the 50% test and also for calculating the capital gain. If the shares are listed in the stock exchange market, then the FMV will be highest quotation value. If not listed, the FMV will be determined by the discounted cash flow method; the equity value, in case of companies under control and supervision of the Peruvian Superintendence of Stock Market (SMV); the equity value adjusted by the average active market rate; or the appraisal value. The FMV method applicable will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Pursuant to the PITL, taxpayers may deduct the foreign income taxes paid due to their foreign-source income levied by the PITL, provided that it doesn't exceed the amount that results from applying the average rate of the taxpayer to the incomes obtained abroad, or the tax paid abroad. The amount that, for any circumstance, is not used in the corresponding fiscal year cannot be set off (or compensated) in others fiscal years or be refunded.
As of 1 January 2020, the following will be taken into account:
  * Tax credit will be granted for the entire tax paid abroad that falls upon income taxed by the PITL.
  * Taxes paid abroad, whatever its denomination, shall bear the characteristics of income taxes.


Taxes paid abroad should be converted to national currency (the taxpayer should apply the average purchase price exchange rate corresponding to 31 December of the fiscal year in which the income was obtained). Since 1 January 2019, specific rules on tax credits were introduced for domiciled entities. As of 2019, domiciled entities will be able to deduct the following taxes as credits (specific requirements will apply):
  * Income tax paid or withheld abroad for dividends distributed ('direct credit') by non-domiciled entities ('first level entities').
  * Income tax paid abroad for the performance of a business carried out by the first level entities ('indirect first level credit') in proportion of the above-mentioned dividends.
  * Income tax paid abroad for the performance of a business carried out by non-domiciled entities that distribute dividends to first level entities, in proportion to such dividends ('indirect second level credit').


## Special deduction regime for projects related to scientific research, technological development, and technological innovation
A special deduction regime has been established for projects related to scientific research, technological development, and technological innovation. As of 1 January 2020, taxpayers investing in these projects will be able to deduct the expenses incurred as follows:
  * For taxpayers whose net income does not exceeds 2,300 tax units: 
    * 240% if the project is executed directly by the taxpayer or through centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation domiciled in Peru.
    * 190% if the project is executed by non-domiciled centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation.
  * For taxpayers whose net income exceeds 2,300 tax units: 
    * 190% if the project is executed directly by the taxpayer or through centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation domiciled in Peru.
    * 160% if the project is executed by non-domiciled centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation.


There are some requirements that must be fulfilled in order to access the benefit.
## Early recovery of VAT
Companies in a preoperative stage with large projects in process may apply for early recovery of VAT prior to commencing operations. An investment agreement with the government (the Ministry of its sector) is required.
Among other requirements, companies that carry out investment projects and generate CIT can access the regime if they make an investment commitment of not less than USD 5 million as a total investment amount, including the sum of all stages. 
## Stability agreement
Investors may enter into stability agreements with the government, either under the general regime or specific regimes (i.e. mining and petroleum).
Under the general regime, investors may enter into Juridical Stability Agreements that guarantee the following advantages for a ten-year period:
  * Stability of the income tax regime in force at the time the agreement is entered into with respect to dividends and profit distribution.
  * Stability of the Peruvian government monetary policy, according to which there is a complete absence of exchange controls, foreign currency can be freely acquired or sold at whatever exchange rate the market offers, and funds can be remitted abroad without any previous authorisation.
  * Right of non-discrimination between foreign and local investors.


Under the mining regime, local mining companies may enter into stability agreements of guarantees and investment promotion measures that guarantee the following for 10, 12, or 15 years:
  * Stability of the overall tax regime.

  * Agriculture and livestock enterprises.
  * Aquaculture.
  * Fishing.
  * Tourism.
  * Manufacturing activities linked to the processing, transformation, and commercialisation of primary products originating in the activities listed above and in forest transformation, provided these products are produced in the area.


## Special zones - Centres of Export, Transformation, Industry, Commercialisation, and Services (CETICOS)
CETICOS are geographical areas duly delimited with customs primary zone status and special treatment, destined to generate development poles through industrial, _maquila_ , assembling, or storage activities. CETICOS are located in Paita, Ilo, and Matarani cities.
Agribusiness and agro-exporting activities may be performed within a CETICOS. Agribusiness activity is primarily the transformation of agro-farming products produced in the country. Such transformation must be carried out at CETICOS.
Companies engaged in industrial, _maquila_ , or assembling activities, established or set up in the CETICOS, until 31 December 2022, are exempt from income tax, VAT, excise tax, municipal promotion tax, as well as from any other taxes, fees, contributions levied by the Central Administration, and even taxes that require express exempt regulation.
## Tax credit for textile and clothing companies
Taxpayers who mainly carry out activities in the textile and clothing industry will have a tax credit equivalent to 20% of the amount of annual profits reinvested during fiscal years 2024 to 2028. 
## Special depreciation regime for textile and clothing companies
A special deduction regime has been established for machinery and equipment of taxpayers who mainly carry out activities in the textile and clothing industry according to the following detail:
  * The machinery and equipment acquired in 2024 and 2025 may be depreciated applying a maximum rate of 33.33%.
  * The machinery and equipment acquired in 2026, 2027, and 2028 may be depreciated applying a maximum rate of 20%.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Domestic corporations are required to withhold income tax with respect to income paid to non-resident entities at the following rates:
Type of payment | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends or profit distributions | 5  
Interest on non-related party loans, provided certain requirements are fulfilled | 4.99

If the retribution for technical assistance exceeds 140 tax units, a report issued by an audit firm will be required, in which is stated that the technical assistance has been effectively rendered in order to apply the 15% WHT rate; otherwise, a WHT rate of 30% will apply.
Capital gains derived from the sale of stocks issued by a Peruvian company through the Lima Stock Exchange are taxed at a 5% rate. 
The royalties received by Peruvians and foreign authors and translators of books or related editorial products will be exempted from the income tax until to 2026.
In the case of the services mentioned below that entail the execution of activities both in Peru and abroad, non-resident entities are subject to a 30% WHT (except for the lease of vessels and aircraft, which are subject to a 10% WHT) on deemed Peru-source income determined by applying the following percentages to gross income:

Peru has entered into treaties with Brazil, Canada, Chile, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Portugal, and Switzerland regarding double taxation on income tax under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model. 
Peru, as a member of the Andean Community, which also includes Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador, is subject to a double-taxation standard (based in source income and not on the OECD Model). 
In May 2024, Peru and the United Kingdom completed the negotiation of an Agreement to avoid double taxation with the objective of eliminating tax barriers that discourage trade and investment. Both countries expect to sign the Treaty in the following months.
Please see the chart below for the reduced WHT rates that apply under DTTs in force.
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties | Technical assistance | Digital services  
Non-treaty | 5 | 4.99/30 | 30 | 15 | 30  
Treaty:  
Brazil | 10/15 (1) | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15  
Canada | 10/15 (1) | 15 | 15 | N/A | N/A  
Chile | 10/15 (1) | 10/15 (2) | 15 | N/A | N/A  
Japan | 10 | 10 | 15 | N/A | N/A  
Korea | 10 | 15 | 15 | 10 | N/A

Switzerland | 10/15 (1) | 10/15 (2) | 15 | 10 | 10  
Notes
  1. The lower rate applies in case the beneficial owner is a company that controls at least 20% (Brazil), 10% (Canada, Portugal, and Switzerland), or 25% (Chile and Mexico) of the voting power in the company paying the dividends.
  2. The lower rate applies to loans from banks (Portugal and Switzerland) and sale on credit of industrial, commercial, and scientific equipment (Switzerland). Beginning 2 July 2023, a Treaty signed by the members of the Pacific Alliance entered into force. In this Treaty, a lower rate (10%) will apply to the pension funds. The reduced tax rate will apply to the Treaties in place with Chile and Mexico. According to this treaty if, due to domestic rules, the interests are exempted or the tax rate applicable is lower than 10%, rules of Article 11 (Interest) of those Treaties will apply.
  3. The treaty rate applies to technical assistance in connection with copyrights, goods, or rights that generate royalties.

## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
A Model 1 Intergovernmental agreement (IGA) is treated as 'in effect' by the United States (US) Treasury as of 1 May 2014. The US and Peruvian governments have reached an agreement in substance, and Peru has consented to disclose this status. In accordance with this status, the text of such IGA has not been released, and financial institutions in Peru are allowed to register on the FATCA registration website consistent with the treatment of having an IGA in effect, provided that the jurisdiction continues to demonstrate firm resolve to sign the IGA as soon as possible.
## Peru as a full member of the OECD
Peru is currently working on becoming a full member of the OECD. 
## Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) Report
As of 2019, legal persons and entities are required to identify, obtain, update, declare, retain, and provide information about their ultimate beneficiaries and, in this regard, they have to submit the UBO Report.
The Peruvian tax administration established that any legal person considered as a principal taxpayer in Peru had until 23 December 2019 to submit the Report. Furthermore, in March 2022, the Peruvian tax administration provided a new schedule stating that:
  * Legal persons that in 2021 generated a net taxable income greater than 1,000 tax units had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of May 2022.
  * Legal persons that in 2021 generated a net taxable income between 500 tax units and 1,000 tax units had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of August 2022.
  * Legal persons that in 2022 generated a net taxable income greater than 300 tax units and were not required to file this affidavit before had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of May 2023.
  * Entities registered in the Taxpayers' Identification Registry (RUC) by 30 September 2024 had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of September 2024.


The identification of these beneficiaries is based on the following criteria: (i) the individual who directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the legal entity’s shares, (ii) the individual who, acting individually or with others as a decision unit, has power to designate or remove the majority of the administrative, management, or supervisory bodies, or has decision-making power in the financial, operational, and/or commercial agreements that are adopted, or (iii) when there is no possibility to identify an individual by criteria (i) and (ii), the ultimate beneficiary of the legal entity that should be reported is the individual within the company with the highest administrative position.
## Special Regime for Tax Debts
To provide greater flexibility to taxpayers in fulfilling their tax obligations, a Regime was approved to establish a special instalments payment plan for tax debts. The tax debts that can be eligible for the Regime are the ones generated until December 2023. The Regime offers three payment options: cash payment, summary payment and instalments payment.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
The first in first out (FIFO), average, specific-identification, retail, and normal or base-stock methods are allowed for inventory valuation. The last in first out (LIFO) method is not permitted.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. However, capital gains derived from the sale of stock issued by a Peruvian company through the Lima Stock Exchange are taxed at a 5% rate, provided that the seller is a non-domiciled party.
Indirect transfer of Peruvian shares is also subject to income tax in Peru, provided certain requirements are met. 
## Dividend income
Dividends distributed to domiciled individuals and non-domiciled taxpayers (entities or individuals) are subject to WHT. Nevertheless, dividends distributed to domiciled entities are not subject to any taxes.
If the dividends distributed correspond to earnings obtained up to fiscal year 2014, the WHT applicable will be 4.1%. If the dividends correspond to earnings obtained in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the WHT applicable will be 6.8%. For dividends generated from fiscal year 2017 onwards, the WHT applicable will be 5%.
## Interest income
The PITL establishes that the WHT rate on interest arising from loans for non-resident corporations is 4.99%, provided the following requirements are met:
  * In case of cash loans, the entrance into Peru of the foreign currency must be duly accredited.
  * The credit must not accrue an effective interest that surpasses the preferential rate prevailing in the place where it comes from, plus three points.
  * The preferential rate is the average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in 30 days plus four points.
  * The loan must be destined to finance business or taxable activities.
  * The parties involved must not qualify as related parties for tax purposes.


If the loan does not comply with these requirements, a WHT rate of 30% would be applicable.
## Royalty income
Royalties paid to non-domiciled parties are subject to a 30% withholding rate, to the extent that the goods or rights generating royalties are economically used in the country or the royalties are paid by a domiciled taxpayer.
## Foreign income
A Peruvian corporation is taxed on Peruvian and foreign-source income. For active income of foreign source, the company must pay taxes in the fiscal year in which the earned income is accrued. For passive income, the company must pay taxes in the fiscal year in which the income is perceived.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Companies incorporated in Peru are considered resident in Peru for tax purposes and thus subject to a corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 29.5% on worldwide net income.
For purpose of determining taxable income, such entities are allowed to deduct expenses to the extent that they are necessary to generate or maintain the source of taxable income. Requirements, limitations, and/or caps may apply to the deduction of certain expenses (thin capitalisation rules), bad debt provisions, salaries, travel expenses, gifts, donations, penalties, etc.
The PITL allows crediting for various payments against income tax, including income taxes paid in advance, amounts paid for certain other taxes, and income taxes paid in foreign tax jurisdictions, provided that the foreign country’s tax rate is not higher than the Peruvian CIT rate and the taxable income qualifies as foreign-source income for Peruvian income tax purposes.
Dividends and any other type of profit distributions are taxed at a rate of 5% upon distribution, when the distribution is made to a non-resident entity (either individuals or legal entities) and to resident individuals, or when the distribution is agreed to by the shareholders, whichever happens first (resident legal entities are not subject to withholding tax [WHT] over dividends received from other Peruvian corporations). The entity distributing dividends or profits is liable for WHT at the aforementioned rates. 
Nevertheless, enterprises are subject to an additional tax rate of 5% on every amount or payment in kind that, as result of a tax audit, is construed as taxable income to the extent that it is an indirect distribution of such income that escapes further control from the tax administration, including income that has not been declared.
On the other hand, companies incorporated abroad are considered as non-domiciled in Peru for tax purposes and thus subject, in most cases, to an income tax rate of 30% over the gross Peruvian-source income. As a general rule, foreign companies are not allowed to deduct expenses and are taxed on gross income.
## Local income taxes
There are no local or provincial taxes on income in Peru.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The general rate of VAT is 18%. VAT is applicable to the following operations:
  * Sale of goods within the country.
  * Rendering or first use of services within the country.
  * Construction contracts.
  * The first sale of real estate made by constructors.
  * Import of goods.


For all transactions, the vendor is subject to VAT, except in the case of importation of goods or services rendered abroad, but economically used within Peru, for which VAT is self-assessed by the importers and users, respectively.
The VAT law follows a debit/credit system, and input VAT may be offset by output VAT. Should excess input VAT be obtained in a particular month, it shall offset output VAT obtained during the following months, until it is exhausted.
The export of movable goods (including the sale of goods in the international zone of ports and airports) is not subject to VAT, nor is the exportation of the services that meet concurrently with the four requirements that the VAT law states. Thus, VAT paid upon the acquisition of goods, rendering of services, construction agreements, and the importation of goods related to exported goods or services creates a positive VAT export balance.
The positive balance may offset output VAT, income tax, or any other outstanding tax debt in favour of the central government. If the positive balance is not completely offset, as the amount of the aforementioned tax obligations is insufficient, the taxpayer may apply for a refund.
The VAT rate is reduced to 8% for micro and small companies engaged in the activities of restaurants, hotels, tourist accommodations, catering services, and food concessionaires for years 2025 and 2025 and to 12% in 2027.
### Tax Obligatory Payment System (SPOT)
The SPOT is applicable to the sale of certain goods and the rendering of services subject to Peruvian VAT. The main purpose of the SPOT is to generate funds to enable the payment of tax obligations by the VAT payer.
According to the SPOT, all the sales of goods listed in the appendices of the Resolution that are levied with VAT will be subject to withholding, applying the rates established for each kind of good (1.5%, 4%, 10%, or 15%).
Any service subject to VAT, except expressly excluded, will be subject to the SPOT with a withholding rate of 10%. The following services are subject to a withholding rate of 12%: (i) labor intermediation, (ii) maintenance and repair of movable goods, (iii) other corporate services, and (iv) other services levied with VAT. The purchaser or service recipient must withhold a percentage of the transaction price and deposit such amount within the seller’s or service provider’s State Bank (_Banco de la Nación_) account. It is important to note that the right of the purchaser or user of the service to offset input VAT related to such goods and services may be exercised only after the deposit with the State Bank has been executed.
The amount deposited is applied towards the payment of the seller’s or service provider’s Peruvian tax obligations (not just VAT). If after three consecutive months such amount is not used, the seller or service provider may request a refund or use the amount to pay withholdings applicable to purchasers or services recipients.
## Customs duties
Customs duties applied to imports are linked to their classification under the Customs Tariff, given by NANDINA subheading that is determined by the information provided by the importer (through the invoice and other complementary information), as well as the physical recognition by the Customs Officer at the time of customs clearance.
As such, the taxes required are:
  * _Ad valorem_ customs duty (rates of 0%, 4%, 6%, and 11%, as the case may be).
  * VAT (18%).


Other taxes that may apply, depending on the equipment, include the following:
  * Excise Tax.
  * Specific duties.
  * Antidumping and compensatory.
  * VAT perception.


There are no restrictions on imports and exports, although there is a limited list of products that cannot be imported or exported. Exports are not subject to any taxes. The importation of most capital goods is subject to the 0% rate.
The government is empowered to grant duty exemptions under certain circumstances and also to temporarily suspend the assessment of duties on certain products. Customs duties are imposed on an _ad valorem_ basis (the carriage, insurance, and freight [CIF] value of the imported goods). Goods are classified for customs duty purposes under the Harmonized System.
Pursuant to the drawback regime, an exporter may apply for a refund of customs duties paid upon: (i) the importation of goods contained in exported goods or (ii) the importation of goods that are consumed during the production of exported goods.
The refund rate is currently 3% of the freight on board (FOB) value of the exported good, provided such amount does not exceed 50% of the good’s production cost. The refund will proceed for each type of good exported and for the first 20 million United States dollars (USD) worth of goods exported per year (the excess will not be subject to refund).
For such purposes, the beneficiaries of the drawback regime are the manufacturer/exporter companies whose cost of production has been increased by the customs duties paid upon the importation of: (i) raw material, (ii) intermediate products, or (iii) pieces incorporated or consumed in the production of exported goods. Note that fuel or any other energy source used to generate heat or energy for purposes of obtaining the exported good is not considered as raw material.
## Excise tax
The sale of specific goods, including fuel, cigarettes, beer, liquor, and vehicles, is subject to excise tax.
Gambling and betting activities are taxed with the excise tax, including the ones carried out through digital platforms. 
Excise tax rates, and the manner on which the tax is applied, depend on the type of goods or services.
## Real estate property tax
The real estate property tax is levied on the value of urban and rural real estate property. Individuals and legal entities owning the referred real estate properties are considered taxpayers for such purposes. The taxable base is calculated taking into account the value of all the properties owned in a specific local district, as reflected in the internal records of the corresponding local authorities.
The tax is calculated and paid on an annual basis applying the following progressive cumulative scale:
Real estate’s value | Real estate property tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Up to 15 tax units | 0.2  
For the excess of 15 tax units and up to 60 tax units | 0.6  
Over 60 tax units | 1.0  
## Real estate transfer tax
The real estate transfer tax is levied on all transfers of urban and rural real estate property. The taxpayer is the purchaser of the property. The taxable base is equivalent to the consideration agreed upon by the parties to the transaction, provided it is higher than the property’s value (in the relevant year for purposes of the real estate property tax) as reflected in the internal records of the corresponding local authorities.
The tax rate is 3% and must be borne exclusively by the buyer, regardless of whatever the parties agree. The first ten tax units (approximately USD 13,900) should be deducted from the consideration agreed upon by the parties, and the taxpayer should apply the tax rate to the resulting amount.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Peru.
## Payroll taxes
Payroll taxes in Peru are only those characterised as social security contributions (_see below_).
## Social security contributions
### Health contributions
Employers shall make monthly health contribution payments equal to 9% of the compensation paid to employees. In the case of agricultural companies, the rate applicable for fiscal years 2024 to 2028 will be 6%.
Employees shall be affiliated either to the National Health System (EsSalud) or the Private Health System (EPS), according to what option they choose. In the latter, a portion (25%) of the amount paid to the EPS may be used by the employer as a credit to be offset against EsSalud contributions.
### Insurance for high-risk work
Employees who perform high-risk activities established in Law 26790, such as mineral extraction and iron and steel smelting, among others, must have a complementary insurance for high-risk work, which provides coverage such as health care, temporary or permanent disability pensions, and burial expenses relating to work accidents or professional diseases. This insurance is compulsory and must be paid for by the employer.
### Pension funds contributions
Employers shall apply monthly withholdings for pension funds contributions equal to 13% of the remuneration received by the employee in cases where the employee is affiliated with the National Pension System (ONP) or approximately 12.4% in cases where the employee is affiliated with the Private Pension System (AFP). In this last case, 10% corresponds to the personal pension account and almost 2.4% to insurance and commissions for managing the fund.
Regarding the termination of employment of foreign individuals who leave the country, their pension funds in an AFP may be wired to an account of the employee in a foreign bank (the aforementioned 10%).
## Financial transactions tax (FTT)
FTT is applied at a rate of 0.005% on all debits and/or credits on bank accounts held by the taxpayers.
The following operations, among others, are exempted from the FTT:
  * Operations made between accounts of the same holder.
  * Credits to bank accounts for payment of salaries.
  * Credits and debits to bank accounts of diplomatic representations and international organisations recognised in Peru.


Payments of FTT are deductible as expenses for income tax purposes.
## Temporary net assets tax (TNAT)
Companies subject to income tax are obligated to pay TNAT, except for companies that are in preoperative stages or that commenced business on 1 January of the fiscal year in which TNAT must be paid.
The taxable basis is the value of the assets set forth in the taxpayer’s balance sheet as of 31 December of the year prior to that of the tax payment, adjusted for deductions and amortisations accepted by the Peruvian law.
The amount of TNAT is determined by applying the following rates on the taxable basis:
  * Up to 1 million Peruvian soles (PEN): 0%.
  * Excess of PEN 1 million: 0.4%.


The amount paid for TNAT may be credited against the taxpayer’s income tax. If not totally used, the remaining TNAT may be refunded by the tax administration.
## Special taxation on mining industry
The new mining royalty (NMR) regime, special mining tax (SMT), and special mining contribution (SMC) are economic considerations paid to the Peruvian government for the exploitation of mineral resources. The NMR applies to metallic and non-metallic mineral resources, while the SMT and SMC only apply to metallic mineral resources.
The SMC is only applicable to mining companies with projects with tax stability agreements in force. Such companies have voluntarily entered into agreements with the Peruvian government with the purpose of paying this contribution. This special contribution is determined for each stability agreement entered into.
In all three cases, the tax basis is the operating profit of the company, and the special rates and considerations are explained below:
New mining royalty (NMR) | Special mining tax (SMT) | Special mining contribution (SMC)  
---|---|---  
Concept | No tax stability | No tax stability | With tax stability  
Regime | Previous mining royalty modified | New | New  
Cumulative progressive scale based on operating margin | 1% to 12% | 2% to 8.4% | 4% to 13.2%  
Minimum payment | 1% of the sales revenue | N/A | N/A  
The amounts paid will be deductible for income tax purposes as long as they are actually paid during the fiscal year.
## Energy and Mining Investment Regulatory Agency (OSINERGMIN) contribution
The basis for calculating the OSINERGMIN contribution is the monthly invoicing of activities directly related to OSINERGMIN’s regulatory scope (mining activities), after deducting the VAT. The applicable rate is 0.14% in 2020.
## Agency for Environmental Assessment and Enforcement (OEFA) contribution
The basis for calculating the OEFA contribution is the monthly invoicing of activities directly related to OEFA’s regulatory scope (mining activities), after deducting the VAT. The applicable rate is 0.10% in 2020.
## Gaming Tax
The entities (domiciled/branches/non-domiciled) that develop remote gaming and remote sports betting activities will be taxed at a 12% tax rate. The taxable base will be equal to the monthly net revenues (gross revenues minus reimbursements and prizes granted to players) minus the maintenance expenses (a fixed amount equal to 2% of the monthly net revenues).
