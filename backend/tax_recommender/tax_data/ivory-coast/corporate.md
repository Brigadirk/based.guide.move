## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Taxable period
Companies are required by law to have a 31 December fiscal year-end.
## Tax returns
The deadline for filing is 30 June for companies subject to audit requirements and 30 May for other entities.
Taxpayers with a turnover between XOF 5 million and XOF 50 million are taxed under the _taxe d'Etat de l'entreprenant_ and are required to produce electronic, as well as paper, financial statements.
The micro-enterprise scheme is a tax scheme related to taxpayers with turnover between XOF 50 million and XOF 200 million. Micro-enterprises with turnover of at least XOF 100 million can opt for the simplified real taxation scheme or non-commercial income tax regime.
The simplified real taxation scheme (_Réel simplifié d'imposition_) applies to taxpayers with turnover ranging from XOF 200 million to XOF 500 million. Under the simplified real taxation scheme, annual financial statements have a lighter presentation.
The real taxation scheme applies to taxpayers with a turnover above XOF 500 million. 
Financial statements are filed annually, according to local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
## Payment of tax
Payment of CIT is made in three instalments in April, June, and September following the end of the fiscal year, depending on the sector of activity and taxpayer's office, as follows:
  * Medium and large-size companies tax office: 
    * 10 April, 10 June, and 10 September for industrial, oil and gas, and mining companies.
    * 15 April, 15 June, and 15 September for commercial companies.
    * 20 April, 20 June, and 20 September for service providers.
  * Companies with other tax offices: 
    * 15 April, 15 June, and 15 September.


## Tax audit process
Many types of tax audits are available to the tax administration, which may request any accounting-related document for the purpose of tax audit.
The most common is the general tax audit of the taxpayer’s situation, which covers the statute of limitation period. It is carried out with a notice at least five days before the beginning of the audit. The audit is carried out on the premises of the taxpayer for a maximum of six months (with a possibility to extend for a period of three additional months), and a primary tax assessment is issued.
The taxpayer then has 30 days to agree or challenge the assessment, and the definitive assessment is issued within a maximum of three months following the primary tax assessment notification date.
The definitive tax assessment has to be issued within a maximum of two months for taxpayers with annual turnover up to XOF 500 million.
The Tax Annex to the 2023 Finance Law instituted an obligation to digitise tax audits. This obligation to digitise tax audits only concerns the adversarial procedure in the context of in-depth verification of the overall tax situation (VASFE) or accounting checks. The exchange of documents by electronic means between the tax administration and the taxpayers is now mandatory.
Further challenge of the definitive assessment is possible before the head of the tax administration and the court.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations covers the current year and the three prior years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax administration generally focuses on compliance with the CIT filing deadline and on the payment of the instalments.
For consistency of the tax returns, the tax administration focuses on the filing of the additional records (Annual Financial Statements, Etat 301: Annual Salary Statement, Etat 302: Annual Fees Statement), records of the provisions, tax losses, and amortisations carried forward.
During tax audits, the focus is on transactions with non-resident related parties.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
In Côte d’Ivoire, companies are considered resident in tax jurisdictions where they have a registered fixed establishment (e.g. subsidiaries, branches, representative offices).
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A non-resident is considered as having a PE in Côte d’Ivoire when its activities involve a comprehensive commercial cycle in Côte d’Ivoire or when it operates through a dependent agent in Côte d’Ivoire.
According to DTTs, a non-resident is considered as having a PE in Côte d’Ivoire when it has a registered establishment, including a subsidiary, a branch, a representative office, a mine or an oil well, a building site, a manufacture plant, or a trading establishment. Sometimes, a time threshold of six months is considered.


# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset (e.g. 20 years for buildings, 3 years for automobiles). Accelerated depreciation is sometimes permitted for machinery. The following depreciation rates are generally accepted for tax purposes:
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Buildings | 5  
Machinery, equipment (rate depending on equipment) | 8/10/20  
Office furniture | 10  
Office equipment | 20  
Vehicles | 33.3  
Computing equipment | 20 to 50  
A time coefficient is applied to the rate of depreciation to obtain the declining balance. Depreciation rates may be amended, but only after agreement with the tax authorities.
New plants and equipment may be depreciated at twice the normal rate in the first year of use, provided they are depreciated over at least six years. Under certain circumstances, buildings used for staff housing may be depreciated at 40% of cost in the first year. Annual depreciation must be booked to preserve tax deductibility. The whole or any part of the annual charge can then be deferred in annual accounts for fiscal years showing a tax loss. Recaptured depreciation is taxed at full rates. Tax and book conformity is obligatory.
Depletion allowances, as such, do not exist, but tax incentives are available for exploration to replace depleted natural reserves.
## Goodwill
Goodwill (capital gain) deriving from the transfer of assets is included in taxable profit. The gain may be exempt from the income tax basis if the taxpayer commits to reinvest the purchase price of the transferred assets plus the goodwill in the three following years.
If the reinvestment is not completed in the three years, the gain will be subject to income taxation.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses (e.g. legal fees, registration duties on share capital subscription, the costs of any registration procedure, advertisement expenses) have to be amortised over a period from two to five years.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid to shareholders may be deducted. The deduction is limited to the interest on a loan where the amount of the loan does not exceed the company's share capital, even for local holding companies (FY19 Financial Law).
The maximum interest rate allowed is related to the _Banque Central des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest_ (BCEAO) rate plus two points.
The reimbursement of the loan must take place in the five years following the loan.
Total interest must not exceed 30% of the company's pre-tax book income before interest, depreciation, and reserve.
The company's share capital must be paid out entirely.
## Bad debt
Provisions for bad debts are deductible, provided that a minimum set of collection procedures have been engaged.
Bad debts are deductible for income tax purposes unless the debt results from abnormal business decisions.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions to recognised sport and health associations are deductible.
Charitable contributions to individuals or non-recognised beneficiaries are not tax deductible.
Charitable contributions, in cash or in kind, to the state or local authorities for the purpose of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic are tax deductible.
Donations to the state and its branches as part of their actions in matters of public health and hygiene, as well as in the field of social actions, are tax deductible.
## Fines and penalties
Fines borne by corporations are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Regular taxes paid by corporations are deductible for income tax purposes.
Third party taxes (such as WHT on non-resident service providers) borne by corporations are not tax deductible.
## Other significant items
In respect to legal reserves, 10% of net profit must be transferred to a reserve for legal fees until the reserve equals 5% of the paid-up share capital.
To be tax deductible, provisions must relate to existing liability or loss. General reserves are not deductible.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for five years.
Losses derived from depreciation can be carried forward indefinitely.
Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Reasonable royalties, interest, and management and service fees paid to foreign parent companies are tax deductible. However, the deductions should not exceed 5% of the turnover and 20% of the overhead. Otherwise, the portion exceeding the ceiling is not tax deductible. The onus is on the taxpayer to prove that expenses are justified and reflect real transactions.
Sums owed by the Ivorian company in return for an intra-group transaction that have remained unpaid for more than two years and without being subject to WHT on non-commercial profits and/or VAT on behalf of third parties are not deductible.
Where payments are made to a beneficiary located in a non-cooperative country or a tax-privileged country, deduction of sums paid is capped at 50% of their amounts. Non-cooperative and tax haven countries are those recorded on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) blacklist. Tax-privileged countries are defined as countries in which the due income tax amount is less than half of the income tax that would have been due on the same transaction in Côte d'Ivoire.
The excessive portion is added back to the CIT basis.
Deduction of expenses from group transactions is subject to the filing of a transfer pricing form. Failure to file the transfer pricing form results in the disallowing of the expenses. Filing of an incomplete or incorrect transfer pricing form results in a fine of XOF 2 million per error or omission.
CbC reporting is applicable when the group consolidated turnover threshold is met (i.e. XOF 250 billion).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Côte d’Ivoire.
## Transfer pricing
Profits directly or indirectly transferred to related non-resident companies are disallowed from the income tax basis.
The tax administration may inquire on transfer pricing when local subsidiaries having most of their transactions with non-resident group companies record losses.
A transfer pricing report on group transactions must be filed together with annual financial statements, and the description of the method used by the taxpayer to determine its transfer prices must be expressly specified.
Since the 2023 Tax Annex law entered into force, the obligation to produce the master file and the local file is charged to Ivorian companies carrying out international intra-group transactions and coming under the management of large and medium-sized enterprises.
The master file-local file documentation must be produced and made available to the tax authorities on the date of the start of the verification of accounts, namely the date of the first intervention on place as shown on the tax notice.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
A CbC report must be filed when group consolidated turnover of XOF 250 billion is met.
## Thin capitalisation
The deduction of the interest of loans granted on top of the share capital by related parties is subject to restrictions (_see Interest expenses in the_ _section_).
When, because of losses, the equity of the company is less than 50% of the share capital, the company must be recapitalised in the two following years, unless the company is dissolved.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Côte d’Ivoire.


# Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire)
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
The tax rate for branch income is the same as that for corporate income. After-tax branch earnings are subject to a 15% tax (_Impôt sur le revenu des valeurs mobilières_ or IRVM) calculated on 50% of the taxable profit. This is analogous to the WHT on dividends.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Since income derived from business conducted outside Côte d’Ivoire is not taxable, no tax credit is allowed.
## Investment Code
A new Investment Code was enforced in October 2018, the aim of which is to favour:
  * sustainable development by producing socially responsible investments in Côte d’Ivoire
  * local and regional development
  * local content (employment of nationals), and
  * competitiveness of companies.


The Investment Code regimes involve the creation of three zones (A, B, and C), which will be defined by an Order issued by the government.
The duration for the granted tax benefit is:
  * 5 years for Zone A.
  * 10 years for Zone B.
  * 15 years for Zone C.


The Investment Code includes two specific tax incentive regimes: the Investment Declaration Regime and the Investment Approval Regime. Both regimes apply to all economic activities, excluding finance and banking, non-industrial buildings builders, liberal activities (e.g. lawyer, notary), and commerce activities. However, investment related to the creation or the development of important shopping centres could qualify for the exemptions if certain conditions are met.
The new Code has also created priority economic sectors (Category 1), as opposed to non-priority economic sectors.
Category 1 includes:
  * Agriculture and agro-industrial activities.
  * Hotels for projects from XOF 5 billion in Zone A and from XOF 2 billion in Zones B and C.
  * Health.
  * Private investment in high and specialised education.


Category 2 includes all other economic sectors (except those excluded from the benefit from the Investment Code) and hotel projects that do not reach the thresholds for Category 1.
A company eligible for Category 1 can take a definitive option for Category 2 when submitting one's demands for the investments approval regime in Category 1.
The Investment Declaration Regime has no minimum investment threshold, but has special requirements related to the activities of the company.
For the Investment Approval Regime, the minimum investment cost is:
  * XOF 200 million (VAT and working capital exclusive) for large companies (with more than XOF 1 billion turnover).
  * XOF 50 million (VAT and working capital exclusive) for SMEs.
  * For shopping centres: XOF 10 billion in Zone A and XOF 5 billion in Zones B and C.
  * For Category 1 hotels: XOF 5 billion in Zone A and XOF 2 billion in Zones B and C.
  * For Category 2 hotels: Less than XOF 5 billion in Zone A and less than XOF 2 billion in Zones B and C.
  * For major structuring investments: XOF 100 billion in Zone A, XOF 50 billion in Zone B, and XOF 15 billion in Zone C.


The benefit from the Investment Code is granted by the Centre for the Promotion of Investments (named CEPICI), after an application is filed by the requestor.
During the investment period, the beneficiary enjoys the following:
  * Exemption from customs duties (excluding statistic fee and community levies).
  * Temporary suspension of VAT on acquisition of equipment, goods, and service for activities subject to VAT.
  * Exemption of VAT for activities exempted.


After the completion of the investment, the beneficiary enjoys the following exemptions during a period that depends on the Category of activity and Zone the company is located in.
The investments companies approved for developing activities are not concerned by the below exemptions.
### Category 1
####  Zone A
  * 50% CIT exemption during five years for large companies and 75% CIT exemption for five years for SMEs.
  * 50% CIT exemption from business licence tax for five years for large companies and 75% exemption for five years for SMEs.
  * 50% exemption from real estate tax for five years for large companies and 75% exemption for five years for SMEs.
  * 50% exemption from employer contribution on salary for five years for large companies and 75% exemption for five years for SMEs.


####  Zone B
  * 100% exemption for CIT, business licence tax, real estate tax, employer contribution on salary, and dividend tax for five years.
  * 50% exemption for the same taxes for large companies and 75% exemption for SMEs for the last five years.


####  Zone C 
  * 100% exemption for CIT, business licence tax, real estate tax, employer contribution on salary, and dividend tax for ten years, and 50% exemption for the same taxes for large companies for the last five years.
  * 100% exemption for CIT, business licence tax, real estate tax, employer contribution on salary, and dividend tax for 15 years for SMEs.


### Category 2
Category 2 investments enjoy:
  * 25% CIT credit for Zone A for large companies and 37.5% for SMEs.
  * 35% CIT credit for Zone B for large companies and 52.5% for SMEs. 
  * 50% CIT credit for Zone C for large companies and 75% for SMEs.


These incentives may not be combined with sector-specific investment programs, such as those for mining and hydrocarbons.
## Capital investment incentives
With prior approval of the tax authorities and varying with geographical location, 35% to 40% of the total investment in fixed assets related to commercial, industrial, or agricultural activity may be deducted from taxable income. The deduction is limited to 50% of taxable profits. The balance of deduction of the first year may be carried forward over the three following years.
The minimum investment threshold required to benefit from the tax reduction measure is XOF 100 million. This amount is reduced to XOF 25 million for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
## Tax credit for waste recycling business
A tax credit is granted to waste recycling business for the four years following the end of the investment.
This tax credit is equal to 10% of the investment amount but cannot exceed 50% of the taxable profits.
## Special incentive tax measures for investments in agro industry
Special incentive tax measures are granted for investments made in cashew and rubber processing under the approval investments regime of the Investment Code.
The specific incentive measures provide additional tax credits and exemptions regarding companies operating in Category 1.
## Tax credit for hiring and training
Tax credits are available for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large companies for hiring local individuals and interns for degree validation internships.
## Export incentives
No VAT is levied on export sales.
### Export incentives for the mining industry
During the exploration phase, investments may be exempt from payroll tax; VAT on goods and services; additional tax (on the sale of goods) on imports and purchases; all import taxes and duties, including VAT on materials, machines, and equipment used in research activities; registration duties applicable to in-kind or cash share-capital contributions; real estate tax; CIT; and minimum tax.
In the exploration phase, mining subcontractors can benefit from the same import VAT and customs exemptions granted to mining title holders.
Under the FY21 Financial Law, mining activities can no longer benefit from the corporate tax five-years exemption. However, they remain exempted from all import duties, including VAT on recovered investment necessary for operation, special equipment tax, business franchise tax, etc. In addition, they may be granted temporary admission of machines and equipment that facilitate research and exploitation. Mining subcontractors are exempt from customs duties, including VAT on importing of liquid or gas fuels, lubricants, and chemical or organic products intended for the treatment of minerals, for the whole duration of the mine.
A tax on profit is levied as soon as investment funds are recovered. Mining enterprises may not combine these incentives with those of the Investment Code.
### Export incentives for petroleum service contractors
A special and optional tax treatment applies to petroleum service contractors that meet established criteria. The FY21 Financial Law provides for two rates as follows:
  * 6% for service providers to oil companies in the exploration phase.
  * 2.17% for service providers to oil companies in the exploitation phase.


The above-mentioned rates are applicable on all tax-free turnover made in Côte d'Ivoire (FY22 Financial Law).
This optional simplified tax regime covers dividend tax and payroll tax.
CIT and the tax on insurance premiums are exempted.
Standard rates apply for business franchise tax and social security contributions for local personnel. The exemption from customs duties and VAT for oil companies is extended to petroleum service contractors.
## Favourable tax regime for investment companies with fixed capital
The 2022 tax schedule provides for a favourable tax regime for the benefit of fixed capital investment companies. This regime results in exemptions, particularly in terms of income tax and IRVM, for a period of 15 years from the date of creation of the company. They also benefit from exemptions on capital gains from the sale of securities as well as in terms of registration fees.
## Favourable tax measures for microinsurance companies 
Microinsurance companies and operations have benefited from the following tax advantages since the entry into force of the 2022 tax schedule:
  * Reduction in the tax rate on insurance contracts for microinsurance contracts.
  * Reduction of the registration fee on microinsurance agreements.
  * Reduction of the TOB rate on bank charges for loans granted to microinsurance companies.


## Favourable tax measures for preserving environmental resources
There are tax and customs incentive measures to facilitate the acquisition of renewable energy equipment; consequently, companies that invest in the sector of renewable energies benefit from the following advantages:
  * Exemption from customs duties on the importation of any production and distribution equipment or materials of renewable energies or raw materials that allow energy saving and respect the environment, with the exception of community samples.
  * Exemption from VAT on the acquisition of equipment and materials necessary for the production and distribution of renewable energies.
  * Exemption of three years following the year of the start of investments from the tax on banking operations on loans and loan interest taken out by companies in the renewable energy sector for the acquisition of goods and equipment relating to renewable energies.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is generally stated at the lower of cost or market value. Last in first out (LIFO) and first in first out (FIFO) methods are permitted. Book and tax conformity is required.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are normally taxed at full corporate rates. However, the tax on capital gains, exclusive of recaptured depreciation, can be deferred if the gain is reinvested within three years.
Capital gains from direct sales of shares are subject to IRVM (i.e. securities income tax).
## Dividend income
Dividends are brought into taxable income at 50% of the net amount earned by the company (after 15% WHT).
The exemption is increased to 95% for dividends received from a subsidiary if a parent company domiciled in Côte d’Ivoire owns 10% of the subsidiary.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends are unusual, but in the event they are declared, they are not taxable to the recipient.
## Interest income
Interest from loans is brought into taxable income at 50% of the net amount earned by the company (after 18% WHT).
## Royalty income
Royalty income received by a local taxpayer is included in its annual revenue and subject to corporate income tax (CIT).
Royalty income paid by a local taxpayer to a non-resident is subject to a 20% WHT, subject to the existence of a DTT between Côte d’Ivoire and the country of the effective recipient of the royalties.
Most DTTs will provide a reduced rate of 10% or 5% for WHT on royalties.
Royalties are defined by tax treaties.
In the absence of a DTT, the 20% WHT applies to all services payments to non-residents, including royalties.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income, except for profits derived from business conducted through a PE outside Côte d’Ivoire. Since income derived from business conducted outside Côte d’Ivoire is not taxable, no tax credit is allowed.
Interest and dividends from foreign sources are entitled to certain deductions to alleviate instances of double taxation. Subject to provisions of tax treaties, no deductions or tax credits are allowed for revenue from royalties and services.

The rate is reduced to 9% for milk (excepted yogurt and other dairy products), infants milk and homogenised and composite preparation foods for infants, luxury rice, meat imported outside the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and pasta products that contain 100% durum wheat semolina.
Equipment designed for the production of solar energy, previously subject to the reduced rate, is now exempt from VAT as part of the measures in favour of the preservation of environmental resources taken under article 18 of the 2024 Tax Annex (_see the section_).
## Customs duties
Customs duties rates range from 0% to 35%, depending on the classification of the imported goods according to the customs tariff.
Upon import, goods are also subject to the statistical duty (1%), to the community solidarity levy (0.8%), to African Union import tax (0.2%), to community levy (0.5%), and to VAT (18%).
Special taxes, depending on the nature of the imported goods, may apply, such as excise duties.
The economic partnership agreement between Côte d’Ivoire and the European Union (EU) for customs tariffs dismantling is effective since January 2019.
According to this economic agreement, the products from the European Union covered by the tariff lines concerned are duties free when imported in Côte d’Ivoire.
The exemption only concerns the customs duties, excepting the community levies, statistical duty, and domestic consumption taxes due on importations.
### Statistical duty
The statistical duty is levied together with the customs duties during the customs clearance procedures of imported goods.
The rate of the statistical duty is 1% on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the imported goods.
### Community levy
The community levy is due together with the customs duties during the customs clearance procedures of imported goods.
The rate of the ECOWAS community levy is 0.5% on the CIF value of the imported goods.
Products imported from outside the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) remain subject to the community levy at 0.8% for five years from January 2015.
The community levy does not apply to goods imported from member countries of the WAEMU, which includes Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali, Benin, Togo, Niger, and Bissau Guinea.
