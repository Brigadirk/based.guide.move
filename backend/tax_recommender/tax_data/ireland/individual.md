  * There are increases to personal tax thresholds and credits. See table below for detail.


  * The help to buy scheme was extended to the end of 2029.
  * The rental tax credit has been increased to EUR 1,000 (20% of the qualifying payment up to EUR 1,000). This increase will be applied to 2024 as well as 2025.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Irish income tax is imposed on the worldwide income of an individual who is resident and domiciled in Ireland.
An individual who is resident but not domiciled in Ireland is liable to Irish income tax on Irish-source income, foreign-employment income earned while carrying out duties in Ireland, and on other foreign income to the extent that it is remitted into Ireland.
A non-resident individual is generally liable to Irish income tax on Irish-source income only.
## Personal income tax rates
Filing status | 2025 (EUR)  
---|---  
Tax at 20% | Tax at 40%  
Single and widowed person: no dependent children | Income up to 44,000 | Balance of income over 44,000  
Married couple: one income | Income up to 53,000 | Balance of income over 53,000  
Married couple: two incomes  | Income up to 88,000 | Balance of income over 88,000  
### Exemption limits
An income tax exemption is available for certain individuals aged 65 years or over. These individuals are only liable to income tax if their income is above a specified limit. For 2025, the specified limit is EUR 18,000 for an individual who is single/widowed and EUR 36,000 for a married couple. These limits are increased in respect of dependent children. Marginal relief may apply where the individuals' total income exceeds the specified limit.
## Local income taxes
There are no local income taxes in Ireland.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The Irish tax year is aligned with the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Under the self-assessment system, individuals with non-PAYE income over certain threshold and directors controlling 15% or more of the share capital of certain companies are obligated to file a tax return for the tax year by 31 October or mid-November if filed electronically on Revenue Online Service (ROS), following the year end. Tax returns can be filed with the Revenue Authorities by paper submission or using the ROS.
## Payment of tax
Payment of tax under the self-assessment system is made in two instalments. Preliminary income tax for any year is due and payable by 31 October in that year. The tax paid must represent at least 90% of the individual’s final liability for that year, or 100% of the ultimate liability for the prior year. Alternatively, a taxpayer may elect to make a preliminary income tax payment payable in equal monthly instalments by way of direct debit equal to 105% of the ultimate liability for the pre-preceding year.
Any balance of income tax due for a year is payable by the following 31 October provided the individual has met their preliminary income tax liability. For individuals who file their tax return and pay their liability using the ROS, an extension to the payment and filing deadline of 31 October may be available.
## Payment of CGT
Where chargeable gains are realised in the period 1 January to 30 November, the CGT will be due for payment by 15 December. Where chargeable gains are realised in the period 1 December 2020 to 31 December 2020, the CGT will be due for payment by following 31 January.
## Tax audit process
The tax authority in Ireland is the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. An audit of an individual’s annual tax return can be conducted. The primary objective of a Revenue audit is to promote voluntary compliance with tax obligations. The functions of a Revenue audit include checking the accuracy of a tax return, checking the declaration of a liability or a claim for repayment, collection of tax, and the collection of interest and penalties.
Possible triggers of a Revenue audit include the selection by a random audit programme, computerised case selection based on risk analysis and profiling and a proactive system of intelligence gathering.
## Statute of limitations
If the Inspector of Taxes in the Irish Revenue Commissioners considers that a complete tax return has not been made, or if no return was made where one should have been made, the Inspector may issue an assessment which includes estimates of the tax which is considered due. The assessments cannot be issued more than four years after the end of the tax year in question.
If the taxpayer disagrees with an assessment issued by the Inspector of Taxes, an appeal may be lodged by writing to the Inspector of Taxes within 30 days from the date of the Notice of Assessment. On receipt of an appeal the Inspector of Taxes may either revise the assessment having reviewed the grounds of the appeal or may list the case for a hearing before the Appeal Commissioners if the Inspector does not wish to revise the assessment.
In certain circumstances there is no time limit within which the Inspector can issue an assessment, for example if the Inspector considers that a return did not contain a full and true disclosure of relevant facts.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Usually the Irish tax authorities focus on areas which have recently experienced changes. Therefore, it is likely that the tax authorities will focus on claims under the SARP, Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED), and issues relating to share based remuneration, for example.
Additionally, attention is being focused on employee non-cash benefits, expenses, and employers' implementation of Real Time Reporting (RTR).


# Ireland
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment expenses
Expenses that may be deducted from taxable income are those that are incurred wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the performance of the duties of employment. Expenses incurred travelling to and from work and entertainment expenses are not deductible.
## Pension contributions
Contributions to Revenue-approved occupational pension schemes are allowable deductions for employees in respect of PAYE. There is no relief from PRSI or USC for employee pension contributions. No deduction is available in calculating employer PRSI contributions in respect of pension contributions made by employees. Ordinary employer contributions to a Revenue approved scheme are allowed as a deduction for tax purposes. 
The annual earnings limit that (along with age-related percentage limits) determines the maximum tax-relievable contributions for pension purposes is EUR 115,000. 
Tax relief may be claimed on contributions from remuneration subject to the earnings limit of EUR 115,000. The allowable personal contributions are expressed as a percentage of remuneration and are age related as follows:
Age attained during tax year | Maximum relief (%)  
---|---  
Less than 30 | 15  
30 but less than 40 | 20  
40 but less than 50 | 25  
50 but less than 55 | 30  
55 but less than 60 | 35  
60 and over | 40  
The lifetime limit for tax-relieved pension funds for an individual is EUR 2 million, effective 1 January 2014. The Finance Act 2024 introduced phased increases in the lifetime limit increasing by €200,000 for each of the tax years 2026 to 2029 inclusive. The limit will be increased in 2030 by reference to wage inflation. 
The Finance Act 2022 introduces changes to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) such that employer contributions to an employee’s PRSA will not be considered a taxable benefit-in-kind from 2023. It also removes the requirement for both the employer and employee contributions to a PRSA to be treated as if they had been made by the employee for tax relief purposes. The Finance Act 2024 has reintroduced the BIK on employer PRSA contributions for amounts in excess of 100% of remuneration for the relevant year. The change applies from 01/01/2025.
## Personal deductions
### Relief for interest on loans for rental investments, trading companies, and partnerships
The principal non-business expenses that may be deducted are interest on loans for investments in rental properties, certain private trading companies, and partnerships subject to certain conditions. 
### Mortgage interest relief
An extension to the mortgage interest relief for 2024 has been implemented. The credit was introduced for taxpayers who have made payments in respect of a qualifying loan for a principal private residence. The relief will be available to homeowners with an outstanding mortgage balance of between EUR 80,000 and EUR 500,000 as of 31 December 2022.
The credit will be available in respect of 2024, on the increase in interest paid in 2024 over interest paid in 2022. The amount qualifying for relief at the standard rate of tax will be capped at EUR 6,250 per residence, equivalent to a maximum tax credit of EUR 1,250.
### Health expenses
Certain health expenses in relation to nursing home fees can be claimed as a deduction from taxable income at the marginal rate of tax (i.e. currently 40%). Other qualifying health expenses may qualify for tax relief at 20%.
### Employment and Investment Incentive (EII), Start-Up Relief for Entrepreneurs (SURE), and Start-Up Capital Incentive (SCI) 
EII is a tax relief that aims to encourage individuals to provide equity-based finance to trading companies. It provides tax relief for investment in micro, small, and medium-sized trading companies. The scheme allows an individual investor to obtain income tax relief on investments up to a maximum of EUR 250,000 _per annum_ for investments made on or after 1 January 2020 (lower investment limits applied in prior years). The Finance Act 2019 introduced a higher investment limit of EUR 500,000 for investments made on or after 1 January 2020 for those that invest for a minimum period of seven years. From 1 January 2024, a number of changes were made to the relief, which include the minimum holding period required to obtain relief is being standardised to four years for all investments and the investment limit on such investments is now EUR 1,000,000 for all investments. The rate of relief which an investor can claim tax relief was also amended so that the level of relief will be linked to the type of investment made and the level of risk associated with that investment. The minimum investment in any one company is EUR 250. Individuals interested in EII can invest directly through a private placement or through a Designated Investment Fund. Relief is available within the year of assessment in which the investment is made by the individual into the designated fund. This scheme has recently been extended to 31 December 2026.
The SURE, formerly known as the Seed Capital Scheme, is a slightly more generous version of the EII that targets individuals who leave PAYE employment to set up their own companies. The SURE investor may have been a top rate taxpayer when employed, so the scheme is designed to allow him/her to elect to shelter income earned during any of the previous six years in order to maximise the tax rebate. The maximum investment that can qualify under SURE is EUR 980,000 (EUR 140,000 _per annum_ for seven years). Any unused relief is available for carry forward for offset against total income in future years. 
The SCI relief was introduced for 2019 to 2021 and targets very early-stage micro companies. SCI seeks to relax particular conditions for early-stage micro companies that could otherwise prevent founders from raising qualifying starter capital for the company from close relatives. A micro enterprise is a company with less than 10 employees and either turnover and/or balance sheet totals less than EUR 2 million. There is a lifetime cap of EUR 500,000 on the investments made.
## Standard deductions
_Please see Personal exemptions below and the section_.
## Personal allowances
A tax allowance is available if an individual employs a person to take care of an incapacitated relative. The individual employing the carer is entitled to a tax allowance of the actual cost of employing the carer up to a maximum of EUR 75,000. The allowance may be claimed at the marginal tax rate.
A personal allowance for premiums paid to an Irish Revenue approved permanent health insurance (PHI) scheme is available. The allowance may be claimed at the marginal tax rate. Tax relief is capped at 10% of total income for that year.
## Business deductions
In general, arm’s-length expenses may be deducted from taxable income if they are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade/business. Capital items expensed to a company’s profit and loss account are not tax-deductible. 
Contributions to personal pension plans (retirement annuity contracts) are allowable as a deduction for self-employed individuals.
## Losses
A trading/business loss can be offset against the gross amount of other income for that year.
Unused trading/business losses may be carried forward to the following year and used against that years trading/business profits arising from the same trade/business. Certain conditions apply.
In respect of capital losses, these are set off against chargeable gains arising in the same year. Unused losses may be carried forward indefinitely. Gains on development land may only be offset against losses on development land. Inflation relief may not operate to convert a monetary gain into an allowable loss or to increase a monetary loss.
## Restriction of certain tax reliefs for high earners
Certain tax breaks available to high income earners are restricted (e.g. various property based tax incentives, film investment relief). With effect from 1 January 2010, a tapering restriction applies to individuals with income in excess of EUR 125,000 (before claiming the specified tax reliefs), with the full restriction applying to individuals with adjusted income in excess of EUR 400,000. The restriction may apply where the individual’s specified reliefs for the year exceed EUR 80,000. Where the maximum restriction applies, it results in an effective rate of Irish income tax of approximately 30%. Any relief not obtained in a particular tax year is carried forward. In the case of married couples, each spouse is treated separately when calculating this relief.

Ireland does not impose restrictions on movement of funds into Ireland or from Ireland to other countries. Foreign currency bank accounts may also be held in Ireland and abroad. If a new foreign bank account is opened after arrival in Ireland, it must be reported on your tax return.
## Clearance to work in Ireland
Generally, non-EEA nationals require work clearance, and in certain cases an entry visa, to come and work in Ireland, but EEA nationals do not require either an employment permit or visa to come and work in Ireland.

# Ireland
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Employment income
Taxable income includes all amounts, whether in cash or non-cash benefits, arising from an office or employment (e.g. salary, wages, fees, overtime, bonuses, commissions, benefits in kind, assignment related allowances).
Non-cash benefits may include the use of a car, accommodation, other assets or loans at low interest rates, medical and life insurance plans and pension plans in certain circumstances.
Irish PAYE must also be applied to earnings (including non-cash benefits) from a non-Irish employment where the duties of that employment are performed in Ireland.
The portion of the income that relates to foreign duties that is not required to be subject to PAYE may qualify for the favourable basis of taxation known as the Remittance Basis where the recipient of the income is a qualifying individual.
Where the duties of the foreign employment are performed in Ireland for not more than 60 days in total in the tax year and the employee is resident in a country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty (DTT), the Irish Revenue Authorities will not require an employer to operate PAYE, provided certain conditions are met.
## Equity compensation
Where stock options or free or discounted shares are awarded, a taxable benefit arises and employers are required to withhold income tax, USC, and employee PRSI.
Employee PRSI applies to all share-based remuneration.
## Business income
Income from a self-employment (i.e. profits or gains of a trade, profession, or vocation) that is carried on within Ireland is subject to Irish income tax whether or not the individual is an Irish resident.
## Capital gains
An Irish domiciled individual who is Irish resident or ordinarily resident is liable to Irish capital gains tax (CGT) on worldwide gains.
A non-domiciled but Irish resident or ordinarily resident individual is liable to Irish CGT on the full amount of gains arising on the disposal of assets situated in Ireland and on the portion of other foreign gains that are remitted to Ireland.
A non-Irish resident individual who is also non-ordinarily resident is liable to Irish CGT on gains arising in Ireland from the disposal of Irish ‘specified’ assets (e.g. land and buildings in Ireland).
The current rate of CGT is 33%. A rate of 40% applies in the case of certain interests in funds and life assurance policies.
Annual gains of up to EUR 1,270 for an individual are exempt from CGT. This exemption is not transferable between spouses.
For disposals made between 1 January and 30 November (the initial period), the liability falls due on 15 December of the same year.
For disposals made between 1 December and 31 December (the later period), the liability falls due on 31 January of the following year.
For disposals made under a written contract, the time of disposal is usually the date of the contract.
## Dividend income
Dividend withholding tax (DWT) applies to dividends and other distributions made by Irish resident companies, at the rate of 25%. Exemptions from DWT may apply in the case of certain categories of individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland.
Individuals who are resident but not domiciled in Ireland are liable to Irish income tax on foreign investment income to the extent that it is remitted into Ireland.
## Interest income
Interest on most Irish deposit accounts is paid after a deduction of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT), which is charged at a rate of 33%. Where interest is paid or credited on other deposit accounts (e.g. where interest is credited at maturity), income tax at the rate of 33% is deducted at source. DIRT effectively satisfies the full liability to tax.
### Exemptions and repayments
The following can apply to have DIRT repaid or to have deposit interest paid to them without the deduction of DIRT:
  * Individuals or their spouses or civil partners aged 65 or over who are not liable to income tax.
  * Incapacitated individuals.
  * Non-residents.
  * Charities.
  * Companies that do not have a corporation tax liability.


## Rental income
Net profit arising from a rental property is taxed at an individual's marginal rate of tax. Deductions in arriving at net profit include rates, management fees, maintenance, insurance, certain legal and accountancy fees, wear and tear on furniture and fittings, and repairs. A deduction is also allowed for interest on money borrowed for the purchase of, or repair to, the property. In the case of a rented residential property, interest relief is allowed at 100%, and the tenancy must be registered with the Private Residential Tenancy Board (PRTB).
The threshold in relation to deductible pre-letting expenses for landlords has also been increased to EUR 10,000. The premises must now only be vacant for a period of six months to qualify (reduced from 12 months).
In general, a net rental loss can be offset against profit from another property or carried forward against future rental profits. Foreign rental income losses can be offset against foreign rental income only.
If the landlord is not resident in Ireland, the tenant is obligated to withhold tax at the standard rate from the payment of the rent unless the landlord has appointed an Irish resident collection agent. Additional information is also required to be returned to Revenue by tenants and collection agents in respect of tax that has been withheld on rental payments made to non-resident landlords.
### Rented residential relief
Tax relief for landlords will be available against rental income from residential property for tax years 2024 to 2027 inclusive. The relief is available to individual landlords only for tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board or for lettings of a residential property to a public authority. Landlords are also required to have tax clearance and to comply with their local property tax. 
The relief will reduce the tax due on residential rental income by up to EUR 600 in 2024, EUR 800 in 2025, and EUR 1,000 in 2026 and 2027. The relief is capped at the tax liability on the rental income and will be apportioned in the case of joint ownership of a property.
### Rent a room scheme
Income from the letting, as residential accommodation, of a room in a person's principal private residence is exempt from tax where the gross annual rental income is not greater than EUR 14,000. In general, the relief does not apply to short-term lettings, although certain exceptions apply.
The relief does not apply where the letting is between connected parties.
## Exempt income
Certain income tax exemptions exist depending on the personal circumstances of the taxpayer or the source of income. These include income from the following sources that may be exempt from income tax, subject to conditions:
  * Childcare income: Income tax is not payable on the earnings of an individual from taking care of up to three children in the individual’s own home, provided the gross amount received is less than EUR 15,000 a year. Certain conditions apply.
  * Artist exemption: The amount of profits and gains of certain writers, composers, and artists is treated as exempt from income tax subject to a limit of EUR 50,000. The exemption is also extended to non-resident artists who are resident or ordinarily resident in another member state or in another European Economic Area (EEA) state.
  * Profits from occupation of certain woodlands: The total profits and gains are treated as exempt from income tax (but not Universal Social Charge or social security) if the woodlands are managed on a commercial basis with a view to realising a profit. 
  * Profits from lotteries: The total profits from lotteries (granted under certain licences) are exempt from income tax.

  5. Expenses paid to nursing homes that provide 24-hour nursing care are tax relieved at the marginal tax rate.


## Special assignment relief programme (SARP)
### SARP for those employees who arrive in Ireland between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2025
The relief is available for a maximum of five consecutive tax years, both to Irish domiciled and non-Irish domiciled individuals who are required by their existing employer organisation to come to Ireland between 2012 and 2025 to work here for a minimum period of 12 months. The individual can be engaged under an Irish or non-Irish employment contract.
Qualifying individuals will be entitled to exclude 30% of employment earnings over EUR 100,000 (effective from 1 January 2023) from the charge to Irish tax. There is a maximum income limit of EUR 1 million, upon which relief may be claimed.
In addition, qualifying individuals are entitled to receive tax-free payment or reimbursement of the reasonable costs of one return trip to their 'home' country and school fees (up to EUR 5,000 _per annum_) for each child, subject to restrictions. The relief may be claimed up-front by way of a payroll deduction or by way of a repayment after the tax year end. Either way, advance approval by the Irish Revenue is required.
In order to qualify and claim SARP relief, the individual must:
  * have a 'base salary' of at least EUR 100,000
  * be tax resident in Ireland (the individual can also be resident elsewhere)
  * have been non-resident in Ireland for the five years immediately preceding the year of arrival
  * have been employed on a full-time basis by a 'relevant employer' for the entire six months immediately prior to arrival, and
  * perform duties for a minimum period of 12 consecutive months from the date the individual is first assigned.
  * The individual must have a Personal Public Service Number (PPSN, or tax/social security number) at the time the application is submitted to Revenue.


The relevant employer must be incorporated and resident in a country with which Ireland has either a DTT or an exchange of information agreement. The employer must certify to the Revenue Commissioners, within 90 days of the date the individual arrives in the state, that the qualifying conditions have been met.
There are differing conditions in relation to what is included as earnings both for the base salary and the income to which the 30% is applied. Certain other reliefs (e.g. for non-Irish workdays) cannot be claimed in conjunction with SARP relief. The relief also imposes certain reporting obligations on employers.
It should be noted that while the income is relieved from tax, it is not relieved from the USC or PRSI (where applicable).
## Illness/Maternity/Paternity benefit
Certain benefits paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are liable to tax. They remain exempt from PRSI and USC.
## Remittance basis of taxation (RBT)
RBT provides favourable taxation treatment for non-Irish domiciled individuals in respect of foreign investment income (e.g. rental) and foreign-source employment income relating to overseas duties. RBT is not available in relation to earnings from a foreign employment exercised in Ireland. Such earnings are liable to PAYE, subject to certain exclusions. Where RBT applies, the amount of foreign income taxable in Ireland is limited to the amount remitted to Ireland. Where an individual subject to RBT transfers foreign-source income (or property bought using that income) to their spouse or civil partner and that income or property is remitted to Ireland, the remittance will be deemed to have been made by the individual.
Capital gains arising on the disposal of non-Irish assets by non-Irish domiciled individuals are liable to Irish CGT only to the extent that the gain is remitted to Ireland.
Where an individual subject to RBT transfers the proceeds from the disposal of a non-Irish asset to their spouse or civil partner and those proceeds are remitted to Ireland, the remittance will be deemed to have been made by the individual. The table below summarises the position:
Resident, non-Irish domiciled | Income/gains taxable in Ireland  
---|---  
Irish-source income | Yes  
Foreign employment: Irish workdays | Yes  
Foreign employment: Non-Irish workdays | Only if remitted  
Foreign investment income (e.g. rental income) | Only if remitted  
Irish capital gains | Yes  
Foreign capital gains | Only if remitted  
## Foreign earnings deduction (FED)
FED relief was introduced in 2012 to encourage companies that are expanding into emerging markets. The relief applies to individuals who spend significant amounts of time working in a relevant state. The relief has been extended to 2025.
The relief provides for a reduction in the individual's employment income (excluding certain benefits in kind but including share-based reward) by apportioning the income by reference to the number of qualifying days worked in a relevant state in the year over the number of days that the employment is held in the year. The reduction is capped at EUR 35,000 in any year.
The list of qualifying countries includes Algeria, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, China, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, The Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. In order to qualify for relief, an individual must work in a qualifying state for at least 30 days.
## Trans-border workers relief
Income tax relief is available to individuals who are resident in Ireland but who work outside Ireland. The relief operates in such a way as to effectively exclude from Irish tax the income arising from a qualifying employment. In order to qualify for the relief, the individual must hold an employment outside Ireland for a continuous period of at least 13 weeks in a country with which Ireland has a DTT. Income from the qualifying employment must be fully taxed in that country and the foreign tax paid. The individual must also be present in Ireland for at least one day a week during the period of the qualifying employment.
## Research and development (R&D) tax credit
Finance Act 2022, which was enacted into law in December 2022, brought about a number of positive changes to the R&D tax credit. These changes ensure that Ireland’s R&D tax credit is a fully payable credit whereby companies can have each instalment of their R&D tax credit paid out to them or they can elect to offset part of all of each instalment against other tax liabilities of the company (i.e. employment taxes, VAT, corporation tax). Finance Act 2023, which was enacted into law in December 2023, has further enhanced the R&D tax credit by increasing the rate of the credit from 25% to 30% with effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. 
The R&D tax credit is now a 30% credit for eligible costs incurred on qualifying R&D activities. In order for a project to qualify for the R&D tax credit, it must represent systematic, investigative activity in a field of science or technology that seeks to achieve scientific or technological advancement and resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. In addition to a 30% credit, a trading company should also obtain a standard corporate tax deduction for the costs, resulting in an effective 42.5% credit. 
The R&D tax credit rules provide for a three-year fixed payment R&D tax credit regime whereby a company will claim 50% of their credit for an accounting period in year one, 30% of the credit in year two, and 20% of the credit in year three. For each instalment, a company can elect for the instalment to be paid out in cash to the company or for the instalment to be treated as an overpayment of tax that can be used to offset other taxes due and payable by the company. 
Where a company elects to treat an instalment or part of an instalment as an overpayment of tax and the amount so elected is in excess of the company’s tax liabilities, the company has an option to surrender the excess to reward key employees who have been involved in the R&D activities of the company, allowing them to effectively receive part of their remuneration tax free. In order to qualify as a ‘key employee’:
  * the employee must not have been a director of the employer company
  * the employee must not have had a material interest in the employer company
  * the employee must perform at least 50% of their duties ‘in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods, or systems’, and
  * at least 50% of the emoluments of the employee must qualify as R&D expenditure.


The effective rate of tax of the employee cannot be reduced below 23%, and unused tax credits that the employee has been allocated may be carried forward. The employee may only make a claim to the Irish Revenue for a tax refund after the end of the tax year. It is important to note that the amount that can be surrendered by a company to a key employee(s) cannot exceed the corporation tax payable by the company in respect of that accounting period.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
An individual is tax resident for a particular tax year if present in Ireland for 183 days or more in that year, or 280 days or more in that and the preceding year combined, including at least 30 days in each year. An individual is resident in Ireland for a day if present for any part of the day.
There are also specific tax rules in relation to split year relief which may have relevance to individuals arriving in or departing from Ireland.
'Ordinarily resident' is specifically defined under Irish tax law. An individual becomes 'ordinarily resident' after a continuous three consecutive year period of tax residence and lasts for a three-year period after normal tax residence has ceased.
'Domicile' is essentially the country which is considered to be an individual’s permanent home and is distinct from legal nationality and residence.

## Social security contributions
### Pay-related social insurance (PRSI)
PRSI is charged on employment income, including taxable non-cash benefits. Individuals who earn less than EUR 352 in any week are not required to pay PRSI for that week.
PRSI contributions also apply in respect of income from a trade or profession or from investment income. The minimum contribution payable is EUR 500. Payment must be included with preliminary tax, which is payable on or before 31 October of each year. Self-employed persons whose income from all sources is less than EUR 5,000 for 2025 are not liable to PRSI. The self-employed PRSI contribution rate is 4.1%, which is in line with the rate applicable to employees.
From 1 October 2025, the rate of PRSI (employer and employee) will increase by 0.1%. Self-employed individuals will also see a similar increase in their PRSI rate by 0.1%.
The 2025 PRSI rates are as follows:
Earnings up to 30 September 2025 | Employer (%) | Employee (%)  
---|---|---  
Class A1: Most employed persons | 11.15 | 4.1  
Class S1: Proprietary and non-executive directors not insurable under Class A* | 0 | 4.1  
Earnings from 1 October 2025 | Employer (%) | Employee (%)  
Class A1: Most employed persons | 11.25 | 4.2  
Class S1: Proprietary and non-executive directors not insurable under Class A* | 0 | 4.2  
* Please note that different rules apply in respect of non-resident Directors.
Additional notes:
  * Self-employed persons whose income from all sources is less than EUR 5,000 per year are not liable to PRSI.


Employee PRSI applies to all share-based remuneration. PRSI on share awards (restricted stock units [RSUs], restricted stock awards, and performance share awards) is collected at source as part of the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) salary withholding tax (WHT) system. Employee PRSI also applies to Revenue Approved Profit Sharing (APSS) and Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes.
## Universal Social Charge (USC)
The USC is a tax payable on gross income, including notional pay, after relief for certain capital allowances but before deducting pension contributions.
The rates for the USC (from 2025 onwards) are as follows for an individual below the age of 70:
Description (EUR) | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Total income below 13,000 _per annum_ | 0  
Income up to 12,012 _per annum_ | 0.50  
Income between 12,012.01 and 27,382 _per annum_ | 2.00  
Income between 27,382.01 and 70,044 _per annum_ | 3.00  
Income over 70,044 _per annum_ | 8.00  
Income over 100,000 (self-assessed income only) | 11.00 (maximum rate inclusive of 3% surcharge)  
For individuals aged 70 years or over, whose aggregate income for the year is EUR 60,000 or less, or individuals in possession of a medical card and whose aggregate income for the year is EUR 60,000 or less, the rates are as follows:
Description (EUR) | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Total income below 13,000 _per annum_ | 0  
On the first 12,012 _per annum_ | 0.5  
Income over 12,012 _per annum_ | 2.0  
All Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments and income already subjected to Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) are exempt from the USC.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no net wealth/worth taxes on individuals in Ireland.
## Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)
A CAT is levied on assets passing on death and on lifetime gifts. A gift or inheritance will be subject to CAT if either the donor or the beneficiary is resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland, irrespective of domicile status. Gifts or inheritances of assets situated in Ireland are also subject to CAT regardless of the residence status of the donor or beneficiary. The beneficiary generally bears the liability for the tax, and self-assessment rules apply.
## Property taxes
Local Property Tax (LPT), payable in respect of residential properties, operates through a system of self-assessment. The following persons are liable to pay LPT:
  * Owners of Irish residential property, regardless of whether they live in Ireland or not.
  * Local authorities or social housing organisations that own and provide social housing.
  * Lessees who hold long-term leases of residential property (for 20 years or more).
  * Holders of a life-interest in a residential property.
  * Persons with a long-term right of residence (for life or for 20 years or more) that entitles them to exclude any other person from the property.
  * Landlords where the property is rented under a short-term lease (for less than 20 years).
  * Personal representatives for a deceased owner (e.g. executor/administrator of an estate).
  * Trustees, where a property is held in a trust.


Where none of the above categories of liable person applies, the liability falls on the person who occupies the property on a rent-free basis and without challenge to that occupation.
LPT charge is based on the valuation of one’s property as at 1 November 2021. The valuation of one’s property on this date determines one’s LPT charge for each year to 2025. The liability date for LPT is 1 November each year.
If one is the liable person in respect of the property, one is responsible for completing and submitting the return and paying the tax due. For LPT purposes, residential property means any building or structure (or part of a building) that is used as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling and includes any shed, outhouse, garage, or other building or structure and includes grounds of up to one acre.
If a liable person fails to submit a return, the Irish Revenue can estimate the LPT due. A rate of 8% _per annum_ will be charged on the amount outstanding. A maximum penalty of EUR 3,000 will be imposed for failure to submit a return or for knowingly undervaluing property to reduce LPT payable. Where the LPT remains outstanding, a charge will attach to the property. Chargeable persons for income tax/corporation tax/CGT, who are also designated liable persons for LPT, may incur an LPT generated surcharge of 10% of their income tax/corporation tax/CGT liability, where the LPT return is outstanding or agreed payment arrangement is not being met at the date of filing the income tax/corporation tax/CGT return. There are a limited number of exemptions available.
### Vacant Homes Tax (VHT)
VHT was amended in Finance Bill 2024. VHT applies to residential properties occupied for less than 30 days in a 12-month period. The tax will be charged at a rate of seven times the basic rate of LPT applying to the property and will be a self-assessed tax.
## Luxury and excise taxes
EU harmonised excise duties are chargeable on mineral oil products and electricity, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco products sold for consumption in Ireland (regardless of whether produced in or imported into Ireland). Ireland also has national excises on the registration of vehicles (VRT) and on sugar sweetened drinks (SSDT).
## Environmental taxes
From an environmental perspective, there are carbon taxes chargeable on mineral oils, natural gas, and solid fuels. There is an environmental levy on plastic bags supplied for use at the point of retail sale. In addition, Ireland has recently legislated for a new 'latte levy' on supplies by retailers of single-use cups used to contain hot beverages although this has not yet been enacted. The European Union has also introduced its new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which will ultimately mean additional costs when importing certain carbon-intensive goods into the European Union. However, these additional costs do not enter into force until 2026.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is a tax on instruments. It is payable on transfers of land and on other assets where legal title cannot be passed by delivery. It is also chargeable on all instruments of transfer executed in Ireland, and on instruments, wherever executed, which relate to Irish property or to any matter done or to be done in Ireland.
Stamp duty rates of 1% to 6% apply for residential property (but a 15% rate applies to the bulk purchase of 10 or more residential units [situated in Ireland], other than apartments, in a 12-month period). A 7.5% rate of stamp duty applies to transfers of non-residential property, such as land, commercial buildings, and various business assets.
Stamp duty is levied at 1% on most transfers of Irish shares, where the value of the shares exceeds EUR 1,000. Higher rates of 7.5% and 15% can apply to certain transfers of shares deriving value from non-residential immovable property or from residential units, other than apartments, bought in bulk.
A 1% stamp duty/levy applies to life insurance premiums, and a 3% rate applies to non-life premiums. In addition, a fixed stamp duty of EUR 1 applies to an insurance policy, other than life insurance, relating to risks located in Ireland.
## Domicile levy
A domicile levy of up to EUR 200,000 was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010.
This levy applies to individuals who are Irish domiciled in the relevant tax year, irrespective of their tax residence position. It will apply if an individual has:
  * worldwide income (as defined) exceeding EUR 1 million
  * a liability to income tax in Ireland of less than EUR 200,000, and
  * Irish located property with a market value in excess of EUR 5 million on the valuation date (i.e. 31 December in the relevant tax year).


The domicile levy must be paid on a self-assessment basis, and any Irish income tax paid will be allowed as a credit against the levy, provided such tax has been paid at the same time or before the levy for the year is paid. Individuals liable to this levy must file a return and pay the appropriate levy by 31 October following the valuation date. However, Irish Revenue may issue a notice where they have reason to believe an individual is liable to the levy, requiring the delivery of a domicile levy return and payment within 30 days of the date of the notice.
