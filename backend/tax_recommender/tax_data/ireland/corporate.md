## Pillar Two
Finance Act 2024 introduced updates to the Irish Pillar Two rules. The updates mainly relate to the Pillar Two GloBE Administrative Guidance which was released on 18 December 2023 and the Pillar Two GloBE Administrative Guidance which was released on 17 June 2024. The updates also include clarification on the operation of certain aspects of the Domestic Top-up Tax calculation.
## Participation Exemption for foreign distributions
Finance Act 2024 introduced the Participation Exemption for certain foreign distributions, exempting certain income receipts from share capital. It applies to dividends or other distributions received from ‘relevant territory’ resident companies from 1 January 2025 onwards. A ‘relevant territory’ includes EEA and Tax Treaty territories as well as territories where a Tax Treaty with Ireland has been made but is not yet in force (see “Participation exemption for foreign distributions” for further details below).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
In general, arm’s-length expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade are tax-deductible.
Capital items expensed to a company’s profit and loss account are also not tax-deductible. However, depending on the nature of the capital item, they may qualify for tax depreciation (_see below_).
## Depreciation
Book depreciation is not deductible for tax purposes (except in the case of certain IP assets). Instead, tax depreciation (known as capital allowances) is permitted on a straight-line basis in respect of expenditure incurred on assets that have been put into use by the company. The following rates are applicable:
Asset type | Tax depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Plant and machinery | 12.5  
Industrial buildings and structures | 4.0  
Motor vehicles | 12.5  
IP assets | Book depreciation or 7.0  
The allowances are calculated on the cost after deduction of grants, except for plant and machinery used in the course of the manufacture of processed food for human consumption. In this case, the allowances are calculated on the gross cost. Allowances on cars are restricted to a capital cost of EUR 24,000 and may be restricted further (to 50% or zero), depending on the level of carbon emissions of the vehicle.
In certain circumstances, the Irish transfer pricing rules may apply to the computation of capital allowances and charges.
### Accelerated capital allowances
Accelerated capital allowances apply to certain energy-efficient equipment until 31 December 2025. The relief allows for a 100% first-year capital allowance deduction in respect of expenditures incurred on certain approved energy-efficient equipment. This excludes equipment directly operated by fossil fuels from qualifying for the accelerated capital allowances.
### Leasing
Ireland operates an eight-year tax depreciation life on the capital expenditure of most assets. A beneficial tax treatment applies to both finance and operating leases of certain assets. For short life assets (i.e. those with a life of less than eight years), Ireland allows such lessors to follow the accounting treatment of the transaction that provides a faster write-off of the capital cost of an asset rather than relying on tax depreciation over eight years. This effectively allows the lessors to write-off their capital for tax purposes in line with the economic recovery on the asset.
## Goodwill
The amortisation of goodwill is generally not allowable as a deduction. However, a tax deduction may be available for capital expenditure on the acquisition of certain goodwill (_see Intellectual property [IP] regime in the section_).
## Start-up expenses
A deduction may be allowed in respect of pre-trading expenses that are incurred for the purposes of a trade and within three years of the commencement of the trade. Such expenses may be offset against the income of that same trade.
## Interest expenses
A deduction for interest is allowed only to the extent that borrowings are used for the purpose of a trade or acquisition of certain non-trading assets. In addition, interest on borrowings between related parties will be subject to Irish transfer pricing rules (including debt capacity and serviceability considerations) as well as Interest Limitation Rules (ILR) (_see the section_).
## Research and development (R&D) expenses
Expenditure on scientific R&D and payments for the acquisition of know-how in general are allowable deductions. _See R &D tax credit in the section._
## Bad debts
A deduction is available for bad debts written off in the accounts of a company as irrecoverable. Specific bad debt provisions may also be deductible once they satisfy Irish GAAP or IFRS accounting standards. The creation of a general bad debt provision is not a deductible expense.
## Charitable contributions
Companies are entitled to a deduction, as a trading expense, for qualifying donations to approved charities, educational institutions, schools, churches, research foundations, sports bodies, and other approved organisations that satisfy certain conditions. To qualify for a tax deduction, the donation(s) to an organisation in a 12-month accounting period must amount to at least EUR 250.
## Meals and entertainment
Costs incurred for third-party entertainment are not tax-deductible. Entertainment includes the provision of accommodation, food, drink, and any other form of hospitality, including the provision of gifts. Expenditure on _bona fide_ staff entertainment is allowable as a deduction, provided its provision is not incidental to the provision of entertainment to third parties. Certain promotional costs are tax-deductible if they are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade.
## Pension expenses
Contributions to certain employee pension schemes and the cost of setting up such schemes are deductible. Pension contributions are allowable as a deduction for employers in the year in which they are paid.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties imposed for breaking the law, civil penalties, interest, and late filing surcharges imposed by the Revenue Commissioners are generally not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes that are deductible in computing profits for corporation tax include VAT not recovered, the employer’s share of PRSI contributions, and local taxes (i.e. rates levied on commercial property and local authority charges).
## Net operating losses
Losses are computed for tax purposes in the same way as business profits. Trading losses can be offset against other income of any nature, either in the current or preceding accounting period (of equal length). The amount of losses required to shelter the income is dependent on the tax rate that would have been applied to the income in the absence of the loss relief. Any excess losses can be carried forward indefinitely against future trading income. Certain changes in ownership may prevent the carry forward of losses to future periods. Terminal losses that arise within 12 months of the date a company ceases to trade may be carried back three years. 
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Generally, deductions can be claimed for royalties, management service charges, and most interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided the amounts do not exceed an arm’s-length amount. Depending on the circumstances, certain elections may be required. Ireland does not have any thin capitalisation rules, but arm’s-length debt capacity and serviceability analyses should be considered on related-party transactions.
## Anti-hybrid rules
As required by EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2 (ATAD2), anti-hybrid legislation applies for payments made or arising on or after 1 January 2020 and aims to prevent companies from benefiting from differences in the tax treatment of payments on hybrid financial instruments and on payments by or to hybrid entities. A tax advantage arising from this is referred to as a hybrid mismatch outcome.
Hybrid financial instruments are broadly those that are treated as debt in one jurisdiction but equity in another, while a hybrid entity is typically viewed as opaque in one jurisdiction but transparent in another. This tax system arbitrage resulted in companies qualifying for tax relief on payments that were not being taxed in the hands of the recipient (so-called 'deduction no inclusion' (DNI) outcome) or in qualifying for tax relief in more than one jurisdiction on the same payment (double deduction outcome). The rules deny deductions for such payments or, in certain circumstances, subject them to tax in Ireland.
The rules apply to payments between ‘associated enterprises’, broadly defined as entities in a 25% share capital ownership relationship (increased to 50% in certain circumstances), companies that are included in the same consolidated group for financial account purposes, or companies that exercise significant influence (defined in the Act) over the management of the other.
Once a payment is ‘included’ in the recipient location, no deductibility restrictions apply. The definition of 'inclusion' covers not just payments that are subject to tax in the overseas jurisdiction, but also payments to exempt foreign entities, such as pension funds and government bodies. Furthermore, payments to entities that are located in a jurisdiction that does not impose tax on payments from sources outside that jurisdiction are treated as included. A controlled foreign company (CFC)-type charge imposed under the laws of another territory is also treated as included.
Where a double deduction mismatch outcome arises, no restriction should apply if the payment can be offset against 'dual inclusion income'. This is income that is subject to tax in both Ireland and the jurisdiction where the mismatch arises. While imported mismatches, covering payments that fund hybrid mismatches outside of Ireland, can also result in restrictions, these do not apply where payments are made to other EU member states.
An exception applies that provides that the anti-hybrid rules do not give rise to an adverse unintended issue in certain circumstances. The interaction of the existing legislation with simplification provisions under a foreign CFC regime, whereby certain inter-company payments are disregarded, could potentially give rise to unintended consequences under the existing legislation. The amendment intends to provide that an Irish tax deduction is not denied in this scenario where no economic mismatch outcome arises. The amendment is intended to ensure that a position similar to Revenue’s existing published guidance is now codified as part of the legislation.
The legislation also provides clarification of the provisions in respect of the application of the payment to a hybrid entity where the participator/parent of the recipient of the payment is a tax-exempt entity. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, in line with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 2 Report recommendations, only mismatches that are attributable to hybridity are neutralised by the Irish legislation.
Many of the anti-hybrid provisions only apply to mismatches between associated enterprises. In this context, the Act includes amending provisions relating to the timing of the test of association to address unintended consequences under the current legislation. The Act also includes a technical amendment to the definition of associated enterprises in order to ensure compliance with ATAD.
## Reverse-hybrid mismatches 
ATAD further required the implementation of anti-hybrid rules targeting what are known as 'reverse-hybrid mismatches' into EU member states’ domestic law by no later than 1 January 2022. Legislation was also introduced to target reverse-hybrid mismatches, with the rules effective for tax periods commencing on or after 1 January 2022.
At a high-level, a reverse-hybrid mismatch can arise where an entity is treated as tax transparent in the territory in which it is established but is treated as a separate taxable person by some, or all, of its owners, with the result being that some, or all, of the income or gains of the entity goes untaxed in any jurisdiction. The primary effect of the reverse-hybrid provisions is that, where they apply, income or gains, of a 'reverse-hybrid entity' that would not have previously been taxable in Ireland (e.g. on the basis that the entity was viewed as a tax-transparent vehicle such as an Irish partnership) may become taxable in Ireland in the same manner as a company resident in Ireland.


# Ireland
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The concept of ‘fiscal unity’ or consolidated group tax does not exist in Ireland. However, trading losses computed for tax purposes may be offset on a current-period basis against taxable profits of another group company. As with loss relief in a single company, the amount of losses required to shelter the income is dependent on the tax rate that would have been applied to the income in the absence of the loss relief.
A group consists of a parent company and all of its 75% subsidiaries, with all group members being tax resident in Ireland, in another EU member state, in an EEA state with which Ireland has a DTT, or in another country with which Ireland has a DTT. It is also possible to trace through companies quoted on certain recognised stock exchanges (or 75% subsidiaries of companies so quoted). Non-Irish members may only surrender losses from activities that would, if profitable, be subject to Irish tax.
Both the claimant company and the surrendering company must be within the charge to Irish corporation tax. To form a group for corporation tax purposes, both the claimant company and the surrendering company must be resident in an EU country or an EEA country with which Ireland has a DTT (‘EEA treaty country’). In addition, one company must be a 75% subsidiary of the other company, or both companies must be 75% subsidiaries of a third company. The 75% group relationship can be traced through companies resident in a ‘relevant territory’ being the EU, an EEA treaty country, or another country with whom Ireland has a DTT. In addition, in determining whether one company is a 75% subsidiary of another company for the purpose of the group relief provisions, the other company must either be resident in a ‘relevant territory’ or quoted on a recognised stock exchange.
Capital losses cannot be surrendered within a group.
Relief from capital gains tax is available on intra-group transfers of capital assets. Where a capital asset is transferred from a resident company to another resident company in a 75% group, no capital gains tax charge arises. A group, for capital gains tax purposes, consists of a principal company and its 75% subsidiary companies. A 75% subsidiary is defined by reference to the beneficial ownership of ordinary share capital, owned either directly or indirectly. A capital gains tax group can include companies resident in an EU member state or an EEA DTT country for the purpose of analysing the beneficial ownership of a company.
It also is possible for an Irish resident company and an Irish branch of an EEA company in the same group to transfer capital assets without crystallising a capital gains charge, provided the asset transferred remains within the scope of the charge to Irish capital gains tax.
Subsequent to an intra-group transfer, a charge to capital gains tax will arise when either:
  * the asset is sold outside the group, in which case the tax is calculated by reference to the original cost and acquisition date of the asset when first acquired within the group, or
  * a company owns an asset that was transferred by a group company and subsequently leaves the group within a ten-year period of the intra-group transfer. The gain on this intra-group transfer crystallises and becomes payable at this point.


## Cash pooling and treasury activities
Ireland is a popular location for cash pooling and treasury activities, with a large number of multinationals centralising intra-group treasury activities to avail of the low corporation tax rate of 12.5%. To further enhance the attractiveness of Ireland as a treasury location, Irish tax legislation contains specific provisions to facilitate cash-pooling activities and ensure favourable tax treatment of ‘short’ interest for tax purposes. Under a typical cash pool arrangement, interest payments by the Irish cash-pool leader typically would constitute 'short' interest for tax purposes because of the overnight/short-term nature of these arrangements.
Short interest is generally regarded as interest on a loan/deposit where the term is less than a year. Essentially, the Irish company will be entitled to a tax deduction for the interest payable to any group company resident outside the European Union in a non-treaty country, provided the recipient country taxes foreign interest income at a rate equal to or greater than the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5%. If the recipient country taxes foreign interest at a rate of less than 12.5%, then relief will be given in Ireland at that effective tax rate. If the recipient country exempts foreign interest, then no interest relief will be available in Ireland. It should be noted that this will affect not only cash-pooling operations but all forms of short-term lending (i.e. less than one year). A tax deduction for interest payable to a group company resident in the European Union or in a country with which Ireland has a DTT is also available, regardless of the rate at which the foreign country subjects that interest to tax.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing legislation endorses the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations and adopts the arm’s-length principle. The regime applies to (most) domestic as well as international related-party arrangements.
The transfer pricing rules extend to most non-trading and certain capital transactions (including the computation of certain capital allowances and charges where the transaction value is greater than EUR 25 million) between related parties.
With effect from 1 January 2023, the legislation has been updated to make reference to the 2022 version of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
With respect to intra-group loans, in addition to ensuring that interest rates must be priced in accordance with the arm’s-length principle, multinational enterprises (MNEs) must be able to demonstrate that the debt capacity of the borrower and serviceability tests have been considered. This is relevant for any interest deductions taken from 2020 onward, regardless of when the loan originated, and is in line with the OECD’s additional guidance on financial transactions.
An exemption from Irish transfer pricing rules for small and medium enterprises has been maintained. Legislation requiring limited scope documentation requirements for medium-sized enterprises will come into effect if and when a Ministerial Order is issued, but this is not yet the case. Broadly speaking, small enterprises include enterprises employing less than 50 people and that have either a turnover of less than EUR 10 million or assets of less than EUR 10 million. Medium-sized enterprises include enterprises employing less than 250 people and that have either a turnover that does not exceed EUR 50 million or assets that do not exceed EUR 43 million.
The transfer pricing rules are 'one-sided' and confer a power on the Irish tax authorities to re-compute the taxable profit or loss of a taxpayer where income has been understated or where expenditure has been overstated as a result of certain non-arm’s-length arrangements. The adjustment will be made to the Irish taxable profits to reflect the arrangement had it been entered into by independent parties dealing at arm’s length.
Enhanced transfer pricing documentation requirements were introduced for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2020, placing an obligation on taxpayers to prepare Master File and Local File reports in accordance with Chapter V of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
In order to manage and mitigate the compliance burden, the Master File and Local File requirements are subject to certain _de minimis_ thresholds. The revenue-based thresholds set out in the legislation are as follows:
  * A Master File must be prepared where total consolidated global revenues of the MNE group are EUR 250 million or more in the chargeable period.
  * A Local File must be prepared where total consolidated global revenues of the MNE group are EUR 50 million or more in the chargeable period.


The legislation specifies that where the relevant revenue thresholds are met, transfer pricing documentation must be prepared no later than the date upon which the annual tax return for the chargeable period concerned is filed (i.e. Irish companies within the scope of the enhanced transfer pricing documentation rules with a 31 December year-end will be expected to prepare and finalise their transfer pricing documentation for that financial year by 23 September of the following calendar year). Transfer pricing documentation must be provided to Irish Revenue within 30 days of a written request.
A penalty regime has also been introduced for non-compliance with the transfer pricing documentation requirements. Applicable compliance penalties are either EUR 4,000 or EUR 25,000, depending on the taxpayer's turnover (i.e. larger taxpayers subject to the EUR 25,000 penalty are those with consolidated group turnover of EUR 50 million or more). Larger taxpayers will also be subject to a daily penalty of EUR 100 a day for each day the documentation remains outstanding.
Where the taxpayer prepares contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation that demonstrates a reasonable effort to comply with the transfer pricing legislation and it is provided to the Revenue Commissioners on a timely basis (i.e. within 30 days of request), there is protection from tax-geared penalties in the careless behaviour category in the event of a transfer pricing adjustment.
For accounting periods commencing before 1 January 2020, Irish Revenue issued guidance to taxpayers on a simplified approach to low-value, intra-group services. For accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2020, this guidance is replaced by Chapter VII of the OECD Guidelines, allowing a taxpayer to apply the simplified approach for low value-adding intra-group services (as defined in Chapter VII). With this simplified approach, a mark-up of 5% can be applied to the relevant costs without the need for a benchmark study to be carried out by the taxpayer to support this rate. Transfer pricing documentation supporting the arrangement should be prepared.
As mentioned above, the transfer pricing rules were extended to most non-trading transactions with effect from 1 January 2020. Section 835E provides for relieving measures that, in effect, disapplied the transfer pricing rules for certain non-trading 'Ireland-to-Ireland' transactions. These new measures work to achieve a clear policy aim of excluding certain _bona fide_ non-trading 'Ireland-to-Ireland' transactions from the scope of the transfer pricing rules.
### Attribution of profits to a branch or PE
Ireland introduced the application of the Authorised OECD Approach (AOA) to the attribution of income to a branch of a non-resident company operating in Ireland for chargeable periods commencing on or after 1 January 2022.
Transfer pricing rules and branch-specific documentation requirements (including associated branch-specific penalty and penalty protection regimes) were also extended to Irish branches and PEs (with some limited exceptions).
### Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) program
Ireland has a bilateral APA program that applies to transfer pricing issues (including the attribution of profits to a PE). The program does not cover cases involving the determination of the existence of a PE.
APAs will be granted for a fixed period of time, typically between three and five years, and a roll-back provision can be requested and provided at the discretion of the competent authority.
### Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAP)
In Ireland, Irish Revenue is the competent authority. Taxpayers may request MAP assistance under the terms of the relevant DTT in conjunction with the relevant articles of the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) where applicable], the EU Arbitration Convention, or the EU (Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanisms) Regulations 2019 (EU TDRM).
## Interest limitation rules (ILR)
The ILR applies in relation to the deductibility of interest with the aim of limiting base erosion through the excessive use of interest deductions by linking a taxpayer’s allowable net borrowing/interest costs directly to its level of earnings. The provisions of ILR operate alongside existing rules that restrict the deductibility of interest expenses. 
The maximum corporation tax deduction available under these rules for net borrowing/interest costs is limited to 30% of tax-adjusted earnings before tax and before deductions for net interest expense, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), subject to some exceptions. These exceptions include:
  * Where the relevant entity’s net borrowing costs are less than EUR 3 million.
  * Where a company is a 'standalone' company, being a company that has no associated enterprises or PEs and is not a member of a worldwide group.
  * Long-Term Public Infrastructure Projects, being projects to provide, upgrade, operate, or maintain a large-scale asset in the general public interest, including large-scale residential projects.
  * Interest on legacy debt, being debt the terms of which were agreed to prior to 17 June 2016.


In addition to the above exceptions, an interest deduction greater than 30% of EBITDA may be available for the relevant entity (i.e. the group ratio). This is on the basis that the relevant entity is part of a consolidated worldwide group for accounting purposes and the worldwide group’s net borrowing costs as a proportion of EBITDA are greater than 30%. The relevant entity can then use this higher proportion in its own calculations.
The second exception available is the equity ratio carve out. For the equity ratio to apply, the relevant entity’s equity ratio must be no lower than two percentage points below the worldwide group or single company worldwide groups’ equity ratio, as applicable, based on the financial statements for the period in which the relevant entity’s accounting period ends. If this carve out applies, the ILR does not apply and the relevant entity can get a full deduction for interest.
### Interest group 
Ireland applies the rules using a 'group approach', that is, calculating the interest restriction at the level of a local group of companies ('interest group'). The legislation provides that the 'interest group' will encompass all companies within the charge to corporation tax in Ireland that are members of a financial consolidation group as well as any non-consolidated companies that are members of a tax loss group for Irish corporation tax purposes, and those companies have elected to join the interest group. The reporting company must make a return on behalf of the interest group on or before the specified return date in the form specified by the Revenue Commissioners. 
### Carry-forward rules
If interest payments are restricted under the ILR in an accounting period, then the excess can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted as a 'deemed borrowing cost' against taxable income, subject to capacity in future periods. If, in an accounting period, there is spare capacity, it can be carried forward for a period of up to 60 months from the end of the accounting period in which it arose.
## Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting
CbC reporting is applicable for Irish-parented multinational enterprises (Irish MNEs). Irish MNEs with consolidated annualised group revenue of EUR 750 million or more are required to comply with the requirements. Irish MNEs must file a CbC report annually to include specific financial data covering income, taxes, and other key measures of economic activity for each territory in which they operate.
In certain circumstances, Irish subsidiaries of foreign headquartered MNEs may also be required to file an ‘equivalent’ CbC report in Ireland.
Irish members of an MNE subject to the CbC reporting obligation are required to notify Irish Revenue of the name and jurisdiction of tax residence of the reporting entity as well as of its reporting status (ultimate parent entity, surrogate parent entity, EU designated entity, or a domestic constituent entity) by the last day of the fiscal year.
## Public CbC reporting
EU Directive 2021/2101/EU was transposed into Irish law by way of a statutory instrument effective from 22 June 2023. This requires public disclosure of certain financial and non-financial information by certain undertakings and branches (i.e. public CbC reporting). The rules apply to both EU based and non-EU based multinational enterprises doing business in the European Union through a branch or a subsidiary with global turnover exceeding EUR 750 million in each of the last two consecutive financial years.
For multinational enterprises whose public CbC reporting obligation is governed by the Irish regulations, the reporting obligation applies from the first financial year starting on or after 22 June 2024 and the report must be filed within 12 months following the respective financial year.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
With effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, CFC rules apply that give effect to measures contained in the EU’s ATAD. Subject to certain exemptions, the CFC rules tax an Irish group entity on the amount of undistributed profits of a CFC that can reasonably be attributable to certain activities that are carried on in Ireland.
A ‘CFC’ is defined as a non-Irish resident company that is controlled by a company or companies that are tax resident in Ireland.
A CFC charge exists where a CFC has undistributed income that can be reasonably attributed to ‘relevant Irish activities’. The term ‘relevant Irish activities’ is broadly defined as being significant people functions (SPFs) or key entrepreneurial risk-taking (KERT) functions performed in Ireland on behalf of the CFC. These functions must relate to the CFC’s legal and beneficial ownership of the assets or the assumption and management of the risks. The meanings of SPFs and the KERT functions are aligned with the 2010 OECD Report on Profit Attribution to Permanent Establishments.
Where a CFC charge exists, the chargeable company is the company in which these ‘relevant Irish activities’ are performed, and the tax rate is dependent on the nature of the income arising. Any foreign tax paid or borne by CFC may be allowed as a credit against Irish tax arising on the CFC charge.
There are several exemptions to the CFC charge, which can be broadly categorised into two main groups:
  * Exemptions that exclude a CFC fully from the charge. These include an effective tax rate exemption, profit/profit margin exemptions, an essential purpose test exemption, and an exemption where the CFC has no non-genuine arrangements in place.
  * Exemptions that apply to specific income streams of a CFC. These include a transfer pricing exemption and an essential purpose test exemption.


In addition, an exempt period may also apply on the acquisition of a CFC where certain conditions are satisfied. 
A CFC that is tax resident in a jurisdiction listed in Annex I of the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes will have a number of the exemptions disapplied to it. The disapplied exemptions are the effective tax rate exemption, the low profit margin exemption, and the low accounting profit exemption.
For an accounting period beginning in the calendar year 2024, the relevant EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions is the October 2023 list.
## EU mandatory disclosure rules (DAC6)
The EU Directive on the mandatory disclosure of certain cross-border arrangements (known as DAC6) is now part of the Irish Tax Code. The Mandatory Disclosure of Certain Transactions legislation imposes a mandatory reporting obligation for ‘intermediaries’ (or the relevant taxpayer in certain circumstances) of certain cross-border tax arrangements to Irish Revenue. 
Where a cross-border arrangement meets certain hallmarks, it must be reported to the national tax authorities within a specified time limit. The hallmarks are seen as characteristics or features that indicate a potential risk of tax avoidance. The information on reportable cross-border arrangements is shared automatically between the member states every three months through a centralised database.
The primary reporting obligation rests with EU-based ‘intermediaries’. However, in certain specified circumstances, the reporting obligation rests instead with the taxpayer. The Directive came into force on 25 June 2018, and it applies from 1 July 2020. The filing deadline for reportable arrangements is 30 days after the reporting obligation is triggered, which is generally the earlier of the date on which the arrangement is made available for implementation, is ready for implementation, or the first implementation step is taken.
## Mandatory exchange of information for digital platform operators (DAC7)
Ireland applies the EU tax transparency rules for digital platform operators (DAC7). Automatic reporting obligations apply to digital platform operators with an EU nexus and to non-EU operators that facilitate the use of a platform by EU resident sellers or the rental of immovable property located in the European Union by any user. The rules aim to provide EU member states’ tax authorities with information to monitor compliance with tax rules for commercial activities performed on digital platforms and identify situations where tax should be paid. The reporting requirements are standardised across the European Union, and the legislation seeks to reduce the administrative burden on operators by requiring platforms to report in only one EU member state where they have operations in multiple jurisdictions. The rules took effect on 1 January 2023, with the first reporting due on or before 31 January 2024.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Irish branches of foreign companies are liable to corporation tax at the rates that apply to Irish resident companies. No tax is withheld on repatriation of branch profits to the head office.
These branches are also subject to the general transfer pricing regulations, as well as specific transfer pricing documentation requirements (_see Transfer pricing in the section for further details_).

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
The main tax incentives in Ireland are:
  * 12.5% corporation tax rate on active business income.
  * A 30% credit on qualifying R&D expenditures; total effective tax deduction of 42.5%.
  * Ability to exploit IP at favourable tax rates.
  * Accelerated tax depreciation allowances for approved energy efficient equipment.
  * Ability to carry out investment management activities for non-Irish investment funds without creating a taxable presence in Ireland for such funds.
  * An effective legal, regulatory, and tax framework to allow for the efficient redomiciliation of investment funds from traditional offshore centres to Ireland.


## R&D tax credit
A tax credit of 30% is available on the full amount of qualifying R&D expenditure incurred by a company on qualifying R&D activities. Qualifying R&D expenditure includes qualifying operational R&D costs and qualifying R&D plant and equipment costs (_there is also a separate R &D tax credit in relation to building, which is referred to further below_). This credit is in addition to the normal 12.5% revenue deduction available for the R&D expenditure, thereby resulting in an effective benefit of 42.5%. 
A separate R&D tax credit is available in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of a qualifying R&D building. In order to qualify, 35% of the building must be used for qualifying R&D activities, and this threshold is measured over a four-year period (although this may be extended if use of the building was impacted by COVID-19). The credit for buildings is of particular relevance where R&D is carried on in a manufacturing environment as the building also needs to qualify for industrial buildings allowances. The credit available is equal to 30% of the proportion of the expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of a qualifying building that aligns to the R&D use of the building over the measured four-year period. 
The R&D tax credit is a fully payable credit that is paid in three fixed instalments as follows:
  * 50% of their credit in year one.
  * 30% of their credit in year two.
  * 20% of their credit in year three.


A company can claim to have each instalment paid out by Revenue in each year or a company can elect to treat part or all of each instalment in each year as an overpayment of tax and use this overpayment to offset tax liabilities due and payable (i.e. corporation tax, VAT, employment taxes) instead of having it paid out in cash. Updates made in Finance Act 2024 mean that companies can now claim the first EUR 75,000 (up from EUR 50,000) of an R&D tax credit claim as payable in the first year even if their first monetised instalment is lower than this based on the three-year fixed instalment rules outlined above.
Companies may account for the R&D tax credit as income in its profit and loss account or income statement in arriving at the pre-tax profit or loss. This immediately impacts the unit cost of R&D, which is the key measurement used by multinational corporations when considering the locations of R&D projects. 
Companies that claim an R&D tax credit have the option, in certain instances, to reward key employees through an alternative use of that credit. In effect, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, the company may allocate a portion of their R&D credit to ‘key employees’ to reduce their effective rate of tax to 23% (the average effective rate of tax for such employees would typically be in excess of 40% in the absence of such R&D tax credit). In order to qualify as a ‘key employee’, the individual must perform 50% or more of their employment duties on qualifying R&D activities.
The R&D regime caters for pre-trading expenditure incurred on qualifying R&D activities. Where a company incurs R&D expenditure but has not yet commenced to trade, an R&D claim can be made within 12 months from the end of the accounting period in which the company first commences to trade. Companies have the ability to claim pre-trading expenditure as a payable credit over a three-year period from when a company commences to trade. Subcontracted R&D costs of up to the 15% of qualifying in-house R&D expenditure incurred by a company or EUR 100,000 (whichever is greater) can qualify for the R&D tax credit.
Payments to third level institutions (located in the European Union, European Economic Area, or United Kingdom) of up to 15% of qualifying in-house R&D expenditure incurred by a company or EUR 100,000 (whichever is greater) can qualify for the R&D tax credit.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of intangible assets that qualify for capital allowances under the IP regime and expenditure incurred in registering/applying for legal protection for intangible assets that are developed as a result of R&D activities do not qualify for the R&D credit.
## Digital Gaming Tax Credit 
The Digital Games Tax Credit provides an incentive to digital games developers to produce games that contribute to the promotion and expression of Irish and European culture. The credit can be claimed as a cash refund on projects that commenced on or after 22 November 2022.
The relief is available for expenditure incurred on the design, production, and testing of eligible digital games, provided certain conditions are met. Subcontractor payments of up to EUR 2 million and certain capital costs may also qualify for relief. The credit is in addition to any corporation tax deduction that may be claimed for the expenses in computing the developer’s taxable trading profit. 
The credit may be claimed either on an interim basis as the game is being developed or in full on completion of the game. In order to claim the credit, an application must be made to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to obtain the applicable cultural certification.
The credit offers a cash injection of up to 32% of eligible expenditure subject to a minimum qualifying spend of EUR 100,000 and a cap of EUR 25 million per project.
## Intellectual property (IP) regime
Legislation provides for a tax deduction for capital expenditure incurred by a company, which is carrying on a trade, on the acquisition of qualifying IP assets. The definition of IP assets is widely drafted and includes the acquisition of, or the licence to use, the following:
  * Patents and registered designs.
  * Trademarks and brand names.
  * Know-how (broadly in line with the OECD model tax treaty definition of know-how).
  * Domain names, copyrights, service marks, and publishing titles.
  * Authorisation to sell medicines, a product of any design, formula, process, or invention (and rights derived from research into same).
  * Applications for legal protection (e.g. applications for the grant or registration of brands, trademarks, patents, copyright, etc.).
  * Expenditure on computer software acquired for commercial exploitation.
  * Customer lists acquired, other than ‘directly or indirectly in connection with the transfer of a business as a going concern’.
  * Goodwill, to the extent that it relates directly to the assets outlined above.


Capital allowances will be available at the same rate as the depreciation/amortisation charge for financial accounting purposes. Alternatively, the company may elect to claim allowances over a period of 15 years. Capital allowances must not exceed an arm’s-length amount.
A shorter write-off period of eight years has also been retained for acquired software rights under the existing capital allowances regime where the rights are not acquired for commercial exploitation (i.e. were acquired for end use by the company).
Capital allowances on capital expenditure incurred on qualifying IP on or before 10 October 2017 are available for offset against income generated from exploiting qualifying IP assets, up to a maximum deduction of 100% of the relevant IP profits.
Capital allowances on capital expenditure incurred on qualifying IP on or after 11 October 2017 are available for offset against income generated from exploiting qualifying IP assets, up to a maximum deduction of 80% of the relevant IP profits. The remaining 20% is taxable at the 12.5% corporation tax rate on the basis that the company is carrying on a trade. 
Any IP amortisation that is not claimed in a year (i.e. an excess amortisation charge over the 100% or 80% qualifying profits in a year) can be carried forward for offset against the relevant trading IP profits of a company in future years.
### Specified intangible assets
All capital expenditure incurred on the provision of specified intangible assets on or after 14 October 2020 will be subject to a balancing charge on a subsequent disposal, regardless of when the balancing event may occur. In other words, all capital expenditure incurred on the provision of specified intangible assets on or after 14 October 2020 will be fully within the scope of the normal balancing charge rules.
No balancing charge will arise on the disposal of specified intangible assets where capital expenditure was incurred on the provision of those specified intangible assets prior to 14 October 2020 and where those specified intangible assets have been held for more than five years.
## Knowledge Development Box (KDB)
The KDB provides an effective 10% corporation tax rate on profits arising from qualifying assets (including copyrighted software and patented inventions) where some or all of the related R&D is undertaken by the Irish company. A Ministerial Commencement Order was signed in October 2023 to increase the effective tax rate on KDB profits from 6.25% to 10% from 1 October 2023 in order to prepare for the implementation of Pillar Two. The relief applies for accounting periods up to 31 December 2026.
## Exemption for new start-up companies
A corporation tax holiday applies to certain start-up companies that commence to trade between 2009 and 2026. The relief applies for three years where the total amount of corporation tax payable does not exceed EUR 40,000 in each year. Marginal relief is available where corporation tax payable is between EUR 40,000 and EUR 60,000. The relief available is linked to the amount of employer’s PRSI paid by a company in an accounting period as it is intended to provide relief at companies generating employment.
The exemption also allows unused relief arising in the first five years of trading (due to losses or insufficiency of profits) to be carried forward for use in subsequent years.
## Section 110 company
Ireland has a favourable securitisation tax regime for entities known as Section 110 companies. A Section 110 company is an Irish resident special purpose company that holds and/or manages ‘qualifying assets’, which includes ‘financial assets’. The term ‘financial asset’ is widely defined and includes mainstream financial assets, such as shares, loans, leases, lease portfolios, bonds, debt, derivatives, and all types of receivables, as well as assets such as carbon offsets and plant and machinery. 
It is possible to establish a Section 110 company as an onshore investment platform for cross-border investments. The Section 110 regime has been in existence since the early 1990s and, with appropriate structuring, effectively allows for corporation tax neutral treatment, provided that certain conditions are met. The regime is used by international banks, asset managers, and investment funds to facilitate securitisations, investment platforms, collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), and capital markets bond issuances.
The range of investments in which a Section 110 company can invest (e.g. financial assets, commodities, plant and machinery) is significant. In particular, the inclusion of plant and machinery has secured Ireland as the leading global centre of excellence for aircraft leasing and financing transactions.
Specific rules exist for Section 110 companies engaged in a ‘specified property business’ that involves the holding, managing, or both the holding and managing of so-called ‘specified mortgages’. A specified mortgage is defined as including loans and shares that derive their value, or the greater part of their value, from land in the State (meaning Ireland). In effect, the Section 110 company’s ‘specified property business’ is to be treated as a separate business from any other business the company may carry on and, with certain exceptions, no interest above a reasonable commercial rate of return will be deductible in computing the taxable profits of that part of the business. The profit calculated will be taxable at the 25% rate of corporation tax. These specific rules where the Irish property business carried on is a CLO transaction, a CMBS / RMBS transaction, a loan origination business, or a sub-participation transaction. In this scenario, the Section 110 company should be entitled to a tax deduction for profit participating interest subject to satisfying certain standard conditions.
Section 110 companies are within the scope of Irish transfer pricing rules, although, helpfully, the rules provide that profit participating notes and loans are specifically outside the scope of transfer pricing. Section 110 companies have always been subject to an arm’s-length requirement, but from 2020 they also need to meet transfer pricing documentation requirements for certain related-party transactions.
Irish tax legislation contains anti-hybrid rules. In summary, these rules are aimed at preventing companies from benefiting from differences in the tax treatment of payments on hybrid financial instruments and on payments by, or to, hybrid entities. It will be necessary for Section 110 companies to consider the impact, if any, of the anti-hybrid rules.
There are two Section 110 anti-avoidance provisions to note. Firstly, the definition of a ‘specified person’ includes situations where a noteholder directly or indirectly holds more than 20% of the principal value of the profit participating loan / note and exercises ‘significant influence’ (defined) over the Section 110 company. Secondly, the general anti-avoidance provision allows Revenue to challenge situations where profit participating loan arrangements were not entered into for _bona fide_ commercial reasons.
As noted earlier, Ireland’s tax legislation includes interest limitation rules. As Section 110 companies are typically heavily debt funded, the impact of these rules will need to be carefully considered.
As noted above, Ireland introduced legislation in relation to Pillar Two. The rules apply to in-scope businesses with accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. Section 110 companies can be in scope for Pillar Two if they meet the relevant criteria and do not qualify for a ‘carve out’, such as the ‘investment entity’ carve out.
## Grants
Cash grants may be available for capital expenditures on machinery and equipment and industrial premises, training of employees, creation of employment, rent subsidies, R&D, manufacturing and exporting products, providing services to customers overseas, etc. The level of grant aid depends on a number of factors and is specific to each project. Rates depend on the location of the new industry.
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign taxes borne by an Irish resident company (or Irish branch of an EEA resident company), whether imposed directly or by way of withholding, may be creditable in Ireland. The calculation of the credit depends on the nature of the income item, but for income sources other than dividends and some related-party interest, the credit is limited to the Irish tax referable to the particular item of income. A system of onshore pooling of excess foreign tax credits applies to dividends from 5% or greater corporate shareholdings, and excess credits in the dividend pool can be carried forward indefinitely. A similar pooling system applies to some related-party interest and also to foreign branch income.
An Irish resident company with a branch or branches outside Ireland is generally taxable in Ireland on the foreign branch profits with a credit for foreign taxes paid on those profits. A unilateral form of credit relief for foreign taxes paid by foreign branches operating in countries with which Ireland does not have a tax treaty is also available. To the extent that there were foreign taxes on branch profits that were not utilised in the relevant period (that is, where credit for foreign tax exceeds the Irish tax payable), these unused credits can be carried forward indefinitely and credited against corporation tax on foreign branch profits in future accounting periods.
A form of pooling of tax deductions in relation to foreign tax on royalties may be applicable where the royalty income is taken into account in computing the trading income of a trade carried on by the company.
An additional tax credit is available on certain dividends received by an Irish Holdco from an EU/EEA subsidiary that is subject to either the 12.5% or 25% rate of Irish tax.
The additional tax credit will provide for a credit up to the amount of Irish tax in instances where the Irish nominal rate is lower than the nominal rate of tax on the underlying profits in the country where the profits are sourced.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Irish resident companies are required to withhold tax on certain types of payments as set out below (_see sub-sections below for WHT exemptions and table at end of this section for WHT rate reductions_).
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Patents, royalties  
Resident companies | 25 | 20 | 20  
Resident individuals | 25 | 20 | 20  
Non-resident companies and individuals | 25 | 20 | 20  
## Dividend WHT
Dividend WHT applies at 25% to dividends and other distributions. However, an exemption may be available where the recipient of the dividend is either an Irish company or a non-Irish company eligible for the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (which in Ireland requires a 5% or greater shareholding).
Exemptions from dividend WHT also are generally available where the recipient of the distribution falls into one of the categories listed below and provided an appropriate declaration is made to the company paying the distribution in advance of the distribution. In a move to significantly ease the administrative burden in applying for exemption for dividend WHT, this declaration is now self-assessed and valid for up to six years.
  * Irish tax resident companies (a declaration is not required for Irish tax resident companies that hold a 51% or greater shareholding of the company).
  * Non-resident companies that are resident in a country with which Ireland has a tax treaty or in another EU member state, where the company is not controlled by Irish residents.
  * Non-resident companies that ultimately are controlled by residents of a tax treaty country or another EU member state.
  * Non-resident companies whose principal class of shares are traded on a recognised stock exchange in a treaty country or another EU member state or on any other stock exchange approved by the Minister for Finance (or if the recipient of the dividend is a 75% subsidiary of such a listed company).
  * Non-resident companies that are wholly owned by two or more companies the principal class of shares of each of which is traded on a recognised stock exchange in a treaty country or another EU member state or on any other stock exchange approved by the Minister for Finance.
  * Individuals who are resident in a tax treaty country or in another EU member state.
  * Certain pension funds, retirement funds, sports bodies, collective investment funds, and employee share ownership trusts.


Please note that the application of the outbound payment rules, which limits the operation of certain domestic exemptions from withholding tax in respect of captured payments would also need to be considered (see below). 
Companies that make a dividend distribution are required, within 14 days of the end of the month in which the distribution is made, to make a return to the tax authorities containing details of the recipient of the dividend, the reason for any exemption from dividend WHT, and to pay over any tax withheld. In addition, Irish resident companies (or intermediaries) are required to take all reasonable steps to obtain and keep a record of the tax reference number for each person beneficially entitled to receive distributions.
## Interest WHT
Financial institutions operating in Ireland are obligated to withhold tax (deposit interest retention tax or DIRT) out of interest paid or credited on deposit accounts in the beneficial ownership of resident companies, unless the financial institution is authorised to pay the interest gross. The rate is 33%. There is no DIRT on interest paid to non-residents where a written declaration of non-residence is completed. Certain yearly interest payments are subject to WHT at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%). Interest payments made by companies to companies resident in other EU member states or in treaty countries are generally not subject to WHT under domestic law. Please note that the application of the outbound payment rules, which limits the operation of certain domestic exemptions from withholding tax in respect of captured payments would also need to be considered (see below). The EU Interest and Royalties Directive may also provide an exemption from WHT for payments between associated companies. In addition, Ireland’s DTTs may provide an exemption/reduced rate of WHT on interest payments.
## Royalties WHT
Royalties, other than patent royalties, are not generally subject to WHT under domestic law. Patent royalty payments and certain other annual payments are subject to WHT at 20%. Lower WHT rates may be accessed under treaties, subject to certain documentation and reporting requirements. The EU Interest and Royalties Directive may also provide an exemption from WHT for payments between associated companies. Associated companies, for the purpose of this directive, are companies where one can directly control at least 25% of the voting power of the other or at least 25% of the voting power of both companies is directly controlled by a third company. In all cases, all companies must be resident in a member state of the European Union.
## Outbound payments
Outbound payment rules were introduced into Ireland recently, which apply to payments of certain dividends, interest, and royalties to associated entities in no-tax and zero tax jurisdictions, as well as those included on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, made on or after 1 April 2024. There are grandfathering provisions that apply to arrangements that were in place on or before 19 October 2023. As such, the new measures will not apply to such grandfathered payments until 1 January 2025.
The rules limit the operation of certain domestic WHT exemptions in respect of captured payments, as well as requiring reporting of these, by providing that WHT should be applied on applicable payments by Irish companies to associated entities that are resident in no-tax, zero-tax, or non-cooperative jurisdictions. There are, however, a number of exclusions from the new rules, subject to certain conditions.
## WHT on capital gains
Where any of the following assets is disposed of, the person by whom or through whom the consideration is paid (i.e. the purchaser) must deduct capital gains WHT at 15% from the payment:
  1. Land or minerals in Ireland or exploration rights in the Irish continental shelf.
  2. Unquoted (unlisted) shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value (more than 50%) from assets described in (1).
  3. Unquoted (unlisted) shares issued in exchange for shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value from assets as described in (1).
  4. Goodwill of a trade carried on in Ireland.


The requirement to withhold tax does not apply where the consideration does not exceed EUR 500,000 (EUR 1 million if the asset is a house or apartment as defined in legislation) or where the person disposing of the asset produces a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners authorising payment in full. A clearance certificate may be obtained by making an application in the prescribed form to the Revenue Commissioners. The certificate may be obtained on the grounds that the vendor is Irish resident, no capital gains tax is due in respect of the disposal, or the capital gains tax has been paid. WHT is creditable against the capital gains tax liability of the vendor, and any excess is refundable.
To avoid the requirement to withhold, clearance must be obtained before the consideration is paid. There is no exemption from the withholding procedure where the asset is held as trading stock or where the transaction is intra-group and a capital gains tax liability does not arise. Failure to obtain the certificate will lead to the purchaser being assessed to capital gains tax for an amount of 15% of the consideration.
## Professional services withholding tax (PSWT)
Individual income tax at the standard rate (currently 20%) is deducted from payments for professional services by government departments, state bodies, and local authorities. Credit is granted for any PSWT withheld against the corporation tax (or income tax for an individual) liability of the accounting period in which tax is withheld. 
## Relevant contracts tax (RCT)
RCT is a WHT that applies in the construction, forestry, and meat-processing industries in Ireland. It applies where a ‘principal contractor’ engages a subcontractor under a ‘relevant contract’ to carry out ‘relevant operations’. 
The RCT system applies if the ‘relevant operations’ are carried out in Ireland, to include Irish territorial waters and any area over which Ireland has exploration and exploitation rights. Therefore, it is irrelevant whether or not the parties to the contract are resident in Ireland, the parties are liable to tax in Ireland, the contract is executed outside Ireland, or whether payments under the contract are made outside Ireland.
It is important to note that principal contractors who are liable to RCT may not necessarily operate in the above industries. In the case of construction, in particular, relevant contracts may be entered into by a variety of entity types. For example, companies involved in electricity generation, oil and gas exploration, and telecommunications undertakings are all classed as principal contractors. In addition, any person who undertakes relevant operations and is liable/answerable to another person (including group entities) for those works will also be regarded as a principal contractor for RCT purposes. Relevant operations are also broadly defined. Examples are fit-out work in offices/buildings; repairs to buildings and structures; ground works; installation, alteration, and repairs to various systems in buildings (e.g. electrical, ventilation, water supply, telecommunications, burglar and fire protection systems); mining; exploration works; and also certain haulage contracts.
It is also important to note there is no group relief for RCT; consequently, any inter-group arrangements for carrying out relevant operations will give rise to RCT issues for both entities.
Where RCT applies, the principal contractor must notify the contract and all payments under the contract to Irish Revenue on the eRCT system in advance of payment being made. Once the principal notifies Irish Revenue that they intend on making a payment to the subcontractor, Irish Revenue will then revert on a real-time basis and issue a Deduction Authorisation to the principal advising of the rate of RCT to be withheld from the gross payment. The current rates of RCT are 0%, 20%, and 35%, and the rate applied to a subcontractor depends on the Irish tax compliance position of the subcontractor. The 20% rate will apply to subcontractors that are registered with Irish Revenue and have a good tax compliance record. The 35% rate will apply where the subcontractor is not registered for tax in Ireland or has an inadequate tax compliance record. The subcontractor is entitled to credit for, or offset of, the RCT withheld by the principal and paid to Irish Revenue after year-end.
If, however, the subcontractor has applied for and received zero rate authorisation from Irish Revenue, then 0% RCT rate applies and the subcontractor can receive payment gross without deduction of RCT. 
If a principal does not notify payments to Irish Revenue in advance of making payment to the sub-contractor, then penalties will apply. It should be noted that the cost of non-compliance with RCT procedures are severe and can range up to 35% of the gross payment; consequently, it is important that RCT is considered before undertaking any construction related activity, in addition to meat-processing and forestry activity.
## Financial Institutions Levy
The Financial Institutions Levy was originally introduced for a three-year period with the express purpose of enabling the financial services sector to contribute to economic recovery. The levy applied to any bank or building society that was required to pay DIRT to the Revenue Commissioners in a specified year (the 'base year') in respect of interest paid on deposit accounts and expired on 31 December 2023. Finance Act 2024 extended the bank levy for 2025, which will be payable by specific banks that previously received state assistance. The bank levy will apply at a rate of 0.112% of relevant deposits held by the financial institution.
## WHT rate reductions and exemptions
Exemptions and rate reductions apply under domestic law and under tax treaties. Where an exemption from WHT is not available (_please see sections above for domestic law exemptions_), a reduced rate of WHT may apply under an applicable tax treaty. The table below sets out the reduced rates of WHT that may be available to payments from Ireland of dividends, interest, and royalties under an applicable tax treaty.
Recipient | WHT (%)

Irish tax legislation allows for favourable treatment in situations where a DTT has been signed but not yet ratified.
Notes
  1. Domestic legislation may also provide an exemption from the dividend WHT, subject to providing the necessary documentary evidence of qualification. An exemption may also be available under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive.
  2. The EU Interest and Royalties Directive may provide an exemption from WHT for payments between associated companies.
  3. In general, royalties WHT applies only in the case of patent royalties.
  4. Under domestic legislation, WHT will generally not apply if the loans or advances are for a period of less than one year or if the interest is paid in the course of a trade or business to a company resident in an EU or treaty country and that country imposes a tax that generally applies to foreign interest receivable.
  5. Rate applying to distributions made on or after 1 January 2020 (previously 20%).


Ireland has signed DTTs with 78 countries; 75 are in effect. 
Ireland and Oman signed a new DTA which came into effect on 1 January 2025.
Ireland has signed a new DTA with Liechtenstein however it is not in effect.
Procedures are underway to ratify the Protocol Ireland and Jersey signed to the existing DTA.
Ireland’s DTTs with Ghana and Kenya are still not yet in effect.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Asset management
Irish tax legislation contains provisions aimed at promoting Ireland as a leading location for the management of both Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and alternative investment funds (AIFs). The UCITS Directives have brought about fundamental changes to both the management and structuring of UCITS. One of the key reforms introduced permits UCITS management companies located in one EU jurisdiction to manage UCITS domiciled in another EU jurisdiction. One of the areas of concern is whether the activities of the management company could bring a foreign UCITS within the charge to tax in the management company’s home jurisdiction (e.g. by creating a branch or agency or causing the fund to be regarded as tax resident there). Irish legislation provides that an Irish management company managing a non-Irish UCITS or AIF will not be regarded as a branch or agency of the non-Irish UCITS or AIF and will not bring the profits of the foreign UCITS or AIF within the charge to Irish tax or treat the foreign UCITS or AIF as an Irish regulated fund.
Following the United States (US) and OECD review of offshore domiciles, which has resulted in increased regulation and tax obligations, many fund managers are considering possible alternative onshore jurisdictions for their investment fund products. Because of the international reputation of its asset management industry and the favourable fund tax regime, Ireland is seeing a significant trend in investment managers moving their investment platforms to Ireland from the traditional offshore jurisdictions. Specific legislation also allows corporate funds to migrate to Ireland through a re-domiciliation process, whereby the fund would benefit from its continued existence, including the ability to retain the fund’s performance track record post migration and avoid potential adverse tax consequences and costs that typically arise from a merger of an offshore fund with a new onshore fund. The Irish Central Bank has a coordinated authorisation process to facilitate speed to market, which, at present, is a key advantage in comparison to delays being experienced in other EU domiciles.
## International funds sector
Recent Irish legislation has introduced a number of provisions designed to support and enhance the international funds sector in Ireland, as set out in further detail below:
### Funds re-domiciling to Ireland
Where the Central Bank has authorised an investment fund that has re-domiciled to Ireland from certain offshore centres (_discussed above_), a declaration can be made by the fund stating that the unitholders are non-Irish resident unitholders, to ensure that no Irish tax charge arises in respect of such non-residents, thereby clarifying the tax exemption applying to payments made by Irish funds to non-resident investors. To the extent that there are any Irish resident unitholders, these need to be identified in the declaration and tax accounted for, where appropriate, on any payments made to such unitholders.
### Cross-border fund mergers involving Irish funds
Mergers (both inbound and outbound) involving an Irish fund with a fund located in a member state of the European Union, European Economic Area, or an OECD country with which Ireland has entered into a DTT will not give rise to a charge to tax in respect of Irish resident investors. Effectively, the charge to tax is deferred until the ultimate disposal of the replacement units. The calculation of any future gain on such units is calculated by reference to the cost of the original units.
No charge to Irish tax should arise on the transfer of units in the formation of certain master/feeder structures.
A number of significant stamp duty exemptions are also available for collective investment vehicles.
### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
The Irish REIT was introduced in 2013, with the objective of providing access to the property market for smaller investors and to facilitate capital injections into the Irish property market. The first REIT listing on the Irish Stock Exchange took place on 18 July 2013. 
The REIT must be incorporated and resident in Ireland and listed in an EU jurisdiction.
REITs are exempt from tax on rental income and capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets of their property rental business if certain conditions are met, notably the requirement to distribute at least 85% of property income annually, that at least 75% of the aggregate income of the REIT must derive from carrying on property rental business, and at least 75% of the market value of the assets of the REIT must relate to the property rental business.
Within 24 months of a property disposal, the REIT must either reinvest or distribute any amount of the disposal proceeds not used to repay debt used to acquire the property (certain other debt repayments may also reduce the required distribution). Amounts not so reinvested or distributed will, at the end of the 24-month period, be treated as part of the REIT’s property income, 85% of which must be distributed annually.
In addition to the above, any expenses that are not incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the REIT property rental business (or, per Revenue guidance, its residual business) may be re-characterised as income of the REIT and subject to corporation tax at 25%.
There is no exemption from VAT, property rates, employment taxes, or stamp duty. The REIT is subject to corporation tax on all other income and gains under the usual taxation rules. There are also requirements regarding the number of investors, properties held, and the financing arrangements that may impact the tax position of the REIT.
Distributions made by the REIT out of rental income and gains are subject to 25% WHT, with exemption/reduced rates available for eligible investors. Distributions out of taxed income are treated as ordinary dividends.
Property gains that have accrued to a REIT are brought within the scope of capital gains tax on a subsequent disposal where a REIT exits the regime within 15 years of entering. 
### The Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle (ICAV)
The ICAV is a form of collective investment vehicle for UCITS and AIFs. It provides managers and promoters with a corporate structure that is specifically designed for investment funds and is not subject to rules or requirements designed for other forms of companies (thereby helping to reduce administrative burden and cost).
Like an investment company, an ICAV is a corporate entity that is governed by a board of directors and owned by shareholders. ICAVs are regulated funds and have all of the benefits of a regulated structure. Consequently, an ICAV needs to be authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland to carry on business either as an AIF or as a UCITS.
The ICAV enhances Ireland’s competitiveness as a domicile for investment funds by virtue of its attractive legal structure. Critically, it also represents a simpler product for US investors from a tax perspective. One of the main advantages of the ICAV is the ability of this structure to 'check-the-box’ for US tax purposes, whereas an Irish plc cannot avail of this election. 
An ICAV may be established as an umbrella structure with a number of sub-funds and share classes. Where an umbrella structure is created, each sub-fund will have segregated liability and also have the flexibility to prepare separate financial statements on a sub-fund basis.
Since its introduction in 2015, the ICAV has been very popular in the Irish funds industry, particularly in the context of investment funds seeking to re-domicile from traditional tax haven jurisdictions to a regulated jurisdiction like Ireland.
### Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs)
Finance Act 2016 introduced a new type of fund, an Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF). A fund will be considered an IREF where 25% or more of the market value of its assets are derived from Irish land or buildings. Consideration of whether a fund constitutes an IREF will, in the context of an umbrella scheme, be determined on an individual sub fund basis.
Where a fund is categorised as an IREF, 20% WHT must be operated by the fund on distributions of income or gains and on gains on the redemption of units.
Certain categories of investors should be exempt from the WHT, including Irish pension funds, Irish regulated funds, life assurance companies and their EEA counterparts subject to equivalent supervision and regulation, Section 110 companies, Irish charities, Irish credit unions, and approved retirement funds. Where the investor is an exempt investor, it may be possible to obtain advance clearance from Irish Revenue in order for the distribution/redemption to be made gross of IREF WHT. An investor will not be considered an exempt investor where the fund is considered a Personal Portfolio IREF (PPIREF) with respect to that investor. Broadly, a fund will be considered a PPIREF with respect to an investor where that investor, or a person connected with that investor, has the ability to influence the selection of some or all of the IREF assets or the day-to-day running of the IREF business.
Anti-avoidance provisions apply, which can result in an income tax liability at the rate of 20% payable by the IREF in respect of shareholder interest that is deemed to be excessive in nature.
Whether shareholder interest payable by an IREF is deemed to be excessive is determined by reference to two legislative tests: an excess debt test and a financing cost ratio test. Broadly, these tests involve a comparison of the IREF’s shareholder debt and interest to the cost of its assets and a comparison of its shareholder interest to the income generated by the IREF, respectively.
A provision also applies such that any expense incurred by an IREF, which is not wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the IREF business, will be treated as income and subject to tax at the rate of 20%.
All other Irish funds, falling outside of this new categorisation, will not be impacted by the legislative changes.
### Investment Limited Partnership (ILP)
The Irish ILP structure is a regulated partnership structure that is authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland as either a Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF) or Retail Investor Alternative Investment Fund (RIAIF). 
One of the unique features of an ILP compared to partnership structures in other jurisdictions is its ability to be structured as an umbrella fund with separate sub-funds, with segregated liability between those sub-funds. As such, it is possible to provide for different investment strategies or limited partners within each of the sub-funds.
The ILP does not have an independent legal existence in the way that an ICAV does. All of the assets and liabilities belong jointly to the individual partners in the proportions agreed to in the limited partnership agreement. Similarly, the profits are owned by the partners. Each partner is entitled to use any tax reliefs and allowances the partnership is entitled to as agreed between each partner, subject to any tax rules governing the allocation of the reliefs and allowances.
The ILP will appeal to global investments managers and promoters of, in particular, private equity, private credit, real estate, sustainable finance, infrastructure, and real assets.
### Common Contractual Fund (CCF)
A CCF is an unincorporated body established by a management company under which the participants, by contractual arrangement, participate and share in the property of the collective investment undertaking as co-owners. CCFs can be established as UCITS or non-UCITS (AIFs). Irish tax legislation confirms the tax transparency of CCFs by confirming that a CCF shall not be chargeable to Irish tax in respect of relevant income and relevant gains, with the relevant income and gains in relation to a CCF treated as arising, or as the case may be, accruing to each unit holder of the CCF in proportion to the value of the units beneficially owned by the unit holder, as if the relevant income and relevant gains had arisen or, as the case may be, accrued to the unit holders in the CCF without passing through the hands of the CCF.
This tax-transparent treatment from an Irish tax perspective only applies where each of the units of the CCF is an asset of a pension fund or beneficially owned by a person other than an individual or is held by a custodian or trustee for the benefit of a person other than an individual.
The tax transparency of CCFs is also respected in many other jurisdictions.
## Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
ETFs are a specific type of investment fund that tracks the value of its underlying investment portfolio, which in many cases is an index of securities but can be a specific investment strategy or even a single asset. ETFs offer the benefits of an investment fund (pooling of investments, diversification, etc.) but can be traded on a stock exchange similarly to an individual stock. Ireland is the second largest domicile for ETFs in the world (after the United States) and the largest domicile for ETFs in Europe. As of 31 December 2024, the total assets in Irish domiciled ETFs amounted to EUR 1.45 trillion.
Irish ETFs are typically structured as investment companies (i.e. public limited companies) or ICAVs. Most ETFs launched since the introduction of the ICAV structure in 2015 have been structured as ICAVs. Irish ETFs and their investors are generally taxed in a similar way as any other Irish investment fund structured as an investment company or an ICAV as set out above.
## Islamic finance
Irish tax law facilitates most Islamic finance transactions, including _ijara_ (leasing), _takaful_ (insurance), _re-takaful_ (reinsurance), _murabaha_ and diminishing _musharaka_ (credit arrangements), _mudaraba_ and _wakala_ (deposit arrangements), and _sukuk_. While there is no specific reference in the legislation to Islamic Finance, rather the reference is to Specified Financial Transactions, overall, the premise of the legislation in Ireland is to ensure that Islamic finance transactions are treated in the same manner as conventional financing transactions.
This legislation also facilitates the taxation (and tax impact) of UCITS management companies. The UCITS structure is one of the most commonly used structures for many different types of Islamic funds, such as retail Islamic equity funds, Shariah-compliant money market funds, Shariah-compliant exchange traded funds (ETFs), etc.
## Islamic insurance
The Irish Revenue has provided guidance in respect of the Irish tax treatment of general _takaful_ (non-life), _re-takaful_(reinsurance), and family (life) _takaful_ arrangements. Legislative changes are not currently required to facilitate Islamic insurance in Ireland.
## Choice of legal entity
Foreign investors tend to operate either through an Irish legal entity or as a branch of a foreign entity. Both are equally valid means of doing business in Ireland, and the choice will normally depend on the commercial fact pattern and individual circumstances of the investor parent company.
## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) intergovernmental agreement (IGA)
The FATCA provisions apply to all entities that fall within the definition of a financial institution (FI). The FATCA regime requires FIs to perform due diligence and reporting obligations with regard to identifying and reporting specified US persons to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on an annual basis in respect of financial accounts held by such persons. The regime came into effect on 1 July 2014, and reporting is required in respect of relevant financial accounts from that date. Many governments have either signed intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) with the United States or have reached agreements in substance with the United States and are effectively treated as having an IGA in place. Ireland signed an IGA with the United States (the US-Ireland IGA), for which enabling provisions were enacted into Irish tax legislation in Finance Act 2013. Further guidance is provided in the Irish Guidance Notes issued by Irish Revenue. 
The annual due date for reporting accounts is 30 June, and this is provided to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The Irish Revenue Commissioners then collate and exchange this information with the IRS. The reporting requirements apply to all Irish financial institutions, as defined, regardless of whether the entity has US account holders or US assets.
### US-Ireland IGA
The US-Ireland IGA defined the types of Irish financial institutions that are in scope for FATCA as:
  * a custodial institution
  * a depository institution
  * an investment entity, or
  * a specified insurance company.


Specific definitions are attached to each type of entity above.
Certain categories of FIs that are regarded as reporting financial institutions (Reporting FIs) are required to register with the IRS in order to obtain a GIIN and submit annual reports. Certain categories of FIs that are regarded as non-reporting financial institutions (Non-Reporting FIs) or ‘Deemed-Compliant’ FIs generally are not required to register with the IRS in order to obtain a GIIN and do not submit annual reports. Such entities include non-profit organisations, financial institutions with a local client base, and certain collective investment vehicles. The categories and definitions of Reporting FIs and Non-Reporting FIs can vary between US FATCA regulations, and between each IGA jurisdiction.
### IGA benefits
Under the US-Ireland IGA, reporting Irish financial institutions are considered to be compliant with local regulations, and, as a result, those entities should not suffer 30% FATCA WHT on US-source income or gross proceeds. Similarly, reporting Irish financial institutions should generally not be obligated to operate 30% FATCA WHT on such payments made to recalcitrant account holders or investors, provided the requirements of the IGA are met.
This is a very positive feature of the US-Ireland IGA and means that the task of developing complex WHT systems to identify and withhold on payments to certain account holders is avoided in most cases.
### IGA requirements
Some of the key requirements of reporting Irish financial institutions under the US-Ireland IGA include the following:
  * Register as a reporting Irish financial institution and receive a Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN). 
  * Apply due diligence procedures to identify and report certain information on US Reportable accounts (as defined) and accounts held by non-participating financial institutions. 
  * Update account on-boarding procedures to identify whether the account holder is considered a US person (individual accounts) and classify and document the account into different categories of account holder (entity accounts). 
  * Annually report certain details on US reportable accounts.


### Reporting
The Guidance Notes contain a link to the IRS Schema and provide details on the transmission of the report to Revenue via Revenue’s Online Service (ROS). Reporting can be done in US dollars or in the functional currency of the financial account. Nil reporting is required where a financial institution has no reportable accounts.
In the case of minor errors discovered by the IRS, the IRS will contact Revenue directly, who will liaise with the financial institution to resolve any issues.
## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)
The CRS came into operation on 1 January 2016 in all early adopting jurisdictions, including EU member states. Over 100 jurisdictions have signed up to CRS, which imposes obligations on FIs to collect and review information in an effort to identify an account holder’s tax residence in a participating country and then, in turn, to provide certain specified account information to the home country’s tax administration on an annual basis.
### Requirements for financial institutions under CRS
A determination is required to be made with regards to whether an entity falls within the definition of an FI for CRS purposes. The definition of an FI is similar to FATCA, albeit wider in scope. If an entity is regarded as an FI and it is located in a participating jurisdiction, CRS requires it to identify account holders who are tax residents in other participating jurisdictions and report their information on an annual basis to their local tax authority, for onward exchange to the tax authority in which the account holder is resident. CRS therefore has a much larger scope than FATCA. Under the CRS, a greater number of customers are reportable compared with FATCA, which focuses solely on US 'specified persons'. Irish Revenue has adopted the ‘wider approach’ with regard to CRS, which means that Irish financial institutions need to report all account holders to Irish Revenue (apart from Irish and US account holders) who will then review this information and pass account information to tax authorities in participating jurisdictions to the extent there are reportable accounts that are resident in that participating jurisdiction.
When opening new financial accounts, financial institutions are required to obtain a CRS self-certification from account holders for all new accounts opened on or after 1 January 2016. There are two types of self-certification forms, individual and entity. If an entity self-certification form is to be completed, then, in the case of passive non-financial entities (Passive NFEs), an individual self-certification must also be completed (along with the controlling persons section) for each of the entity’s controlling persons.
Self-certifications must be reviewed for reasonableness against other information known about the account holder. As a result, the collection and validation of self-certifications must be an integral part of the anti-money laundering/know your customer (AML/KYC) process.
CRS requires separate due diligence review and timelines for pre-existing and new accounts, and for individuals and entities, similar to FATCA. 
There is no single source IRS-style registration for CRS reporting, and, as a result, there are no GIINs or other registration numbers issued to FIs. Each local tax authority may issue its own requirements for obtaining a unique identification number for CRS purposes (as a GIIN may not always be appropriate to use for CRS).
Reporting is due annually by 30 June. Nil reporting is required where a financial institution has no reportable accounts.
_Further details can be found at_ _._
The OECD recently published a much-anticipated two-part document, the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and Amendments to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). This new global tax transparency initiative provides the framework for the automatic reporting and exchange of information with respect to crypto-assets and aims to ensure that the tax transparency architecture remains modern and effective.
In addition, the commentary to the CRS is enhanced to include guidance to improve consistency in the application of the CRS and to incorporate previously released FAQs and interpretative guidance. The amendments to the CRS expand the scope of the CRS to certain e-money products and Central Bank digital currencies. They also seek to enhance the reporting outcomes, including requiring the reporting of the role of each controlling person, whether a valid self-certification has been obtained or not and whether an account is pre-existing or new.
In tandem with this, the EU Commission has agreed to further amendments to Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation (DAC8), which effectively mirror the OECD's CARF and amendments to the CRS. The Commission believes this information will level the playing field and raise additional tax revenues of EUR 2.4 billion by the EU member states; implementation costs are estimated at EUR 300 million with annual recurring costs of EUR 25 million. With a few exceptions, the changes set out under DAC 8 will apply from 1 January 2026.
## Multilateral Instrument (MLI)
The ratification documents required to implement the MLI were deposited with the OECD on 29 January 2019, and the MLI came into effect in Ireland from 1 May 2019. The provisions of the MLI will continue to come into force for the vast majority of Ireland’s treaties over time.
Changes will only take effect where the treaty is with a country that has also deposited its MLI ratification document with the OECD and the required three-month wait period has elapsed such that the MLI is effective in that state. Additionally, only where two states make ‘matching elections’ will the MLI provisions take effect.


# Ireland
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Irish trading profits are computed in accordance with Irish Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), subject to any adjustment required by law. Prior-year adjustments may arise on the first-time adoption of IFRS, which may result in double counting of income or expenses or of income falling out of the charge to tax. Generally speaking, in order to avoid such an outcome, transitional adjustments exist whereby amounts of income or expenses that could be double-counted or that would fall out of the charge to tax are identified and the amounts concerned are taxed or deducted as appropriate over a five-year period.
## Inventory valuation
Each item of inventory is valued for tax purposes at cost or market value, whichever is lower, and this will normally accord with the accounting treatment. The method used in arriving at cost or market value of inventory generally must be consistent and must not be in conflict with tax law. The first in first out (FIFO) method is an acceptable method of calculation for tax purposes. The base-stock method has been held to be an inappropriate method for tax purposes, as has the last in first out (LIFO) method.
## Capital gains
Companies are subject to capital gains tax in respect of gains arising on the disposal of capital assets. The taxable gain is arrived at by deducting from the sales proceeds the cost incurred on acquiring the asset (as indexed to reflect inflation only up to 31 December 2002). The resulting gain is taxable at 33%. In cases of disposals of interests in offshore funds and foreign life assurance policies, indexation relief does not apply; while a tax rate of 33% applies to non-corporate shareholders in respect of funds and policies located in EU/European Economic Area (EEA)/DTT countries, and a rate of 33% or 40% applies to funds or policies located in all other jurisdictions. A reduced rate of 25% exit tax applies to Irish corporate shareholders investing in Irish funds. Special rules apply to gains (and losses) from the disposal of development land in Ireland.
Companies that are tax resident in Ireland (i.e. are managed and controlled in Ireland or incorporated in Ireland and not qualifying for exclusion from Irish residence by virtue of being resident in a DTT territory) are taxable on worldwide gains. Non-resident companies are subject to capital gains tax on capital gains arising on the disposal of Irish land, buildings, mineral rights, and exploration rights on the Irish continental shelf, together with shares in unquoted (unlisted) companies, whose value substantially (greater than 50%) is derived from these assets. Non-resident companies are also subject to capital gains tax from the realisation of assets used for the purposes of a business carried on in Ireland.
Losses arising on the disposal of capital assets may be offset against capital gains in the accounting period or carried forward for offset against future capital gains. No carry back of capital losses is permitted. There is no facility to offset capital losses against business income or to surrender capital losses within a tax group.
The Irish transfer pricing rules apply to capital transactions where the transaction value is greater than EUR 25 million. In certain circumstances, assets can be transferred within certain company groups without capital gains tax applying (_see the section for further information_). In such cases, exemptions may apply from transfer pricing rules.
### Participation exemption from capital gains
A participation exemption is available to Irish resident companies on the disposal of a shareholding interest if:
  * a minimum of 5% of the shares (including the right to profits and assets on winding up) is directly or indirectly held for a continuous 12-month period
  * the shares have been held for a period of 12 months within which the date of the disposal falls or for a period of 12 months ending in the 24 months preceding the date of disposal
  * the company whose shares are sold is resident in an EU member state (including Ireland) or in a country with which Ireland has a DTT at the time of the disposal (this includes tax treaties that have been signed but not yet ratified), and
  * a trading condition is met at the time of the disposal whereby either: (i) the business of the company whose shares are disposed of consists wholly or mainly of the carrying on of one or more trades or (ii) taken together, the businesses of the Irish holding company and all companies in which it has a direct or indirect 5% or more ownership interest consist wholly or mainly of the carrying on of one or more trades.


If the Irish holding company is unable to meet the minimum holding requirement but is a member of a group (that is, a parent company and its 51% worldwide subsidiaries), the gain arising on the disposal should still be exempt if the holding requirement can be met by including holdings of other members of the group. Thus, the Irish company may be exempt from capital gains tax on a disposal of shares even if it does not directly hold a significant shareholding. The exemption also applies to a disposal of assets related to shares, such as options and convertible debt. However, it does not apply to a sale of either shares or related assets that derive the greater part of their value (more than 50%) from Irish real property, minerals, mining rights, and exploration and exploitation rights in a designated area. Shares deriving their value from non-Irish real property, minerals, and mining rights qualify for exemption if the other conditions are met.
Capital losses arising on the disposal of a shareholding where a gain on disposal would be exempt under the participation exemption are not deductible.
### Participation exemption for foreign distributions 
Finance Act 2024 introduced a Participation Exemption which exempts certain income receipts from share capital. The measure is relevant to dividends, or other distributions received from ‘relevant territory’ resident companies from 1 January 2025 onwards. A ‘relevant territory’ includes EEA and Tax Treaty territories as well as territories where a Tax Treaty with Ireland has been made but is not yet in force. 
The key features of the Participation Exemption introduced in Finance Act 2024 include: 
  * Applicable in respect of dividends or other distributions received as income from EEA/ Treaty resident companies 
  * Optionality - elect in on an accounting period by accounting period basis. Exists in tandem with the current ‘tax and credit’ regime 
  * Ownership requirement - 5% of ordinary share capital, profits and assets entitlements for continuous 12 month period
  * It is expected that where a dividend/distribution is paid out of profits - no participation exemption requirement exists (Note: the current wording creates slight uncertainty around this point and clarification may be needed) 
  * Where dividend/distribution paid out of assets - participation exemption requirement to be satisfied 
  * Exclusions for S110 companies, capital receipts and, amounts in respect of which a tax deduction was or may be taken


### Capital gains tax entrepreneur relief
Capital gains tax entrepreneur relief allows for a reduction in the capital gains rate to 10% on the disposal of chargeable business assets from 1 January 2017, up to a lifetime limit of EUR 1 million. This allows entrepreneurs to free up more capital for reinvestment and builds on Ireland’s focus to drive investment in new businesses.
For disposals on or after 1 January 2021, a qualifying shareholding is an individual that holds at least 5% of the shares in a qualifying company for a continuous period of at least three years at any time prior to the disposal. For disposals before this date, a qualifying investor is an individual who was required to hold at least 5% of the shares in a qualifying company for a period of at least three out of the five years immediately prior to the disposal.
### Capital gains tax treatment of debts
A deposit or lodgement of money with a bank gives rise to a debt owing from the bank to the depositor of that money. Transfers of funds between foreign currency bank accounts held by the same person (within the same bank or transfers to other banks) are regarded as disposals for capital gains tax purposes. The Act sees an amendment that provides that transfers from a bank account (in respect of a debt owed by a bank that is not in the currency of the State) into another bank account in the same currency is to be treated as having been made for such consideration as to secure that no gain or no loss will arise on the disposal for capital gains tax purposes. On any further disposal, the base cost of the debt is to be determined as if this transfer between the bank accounts had not taken place**.**
## Dividend income
Dividends from Irish resident companies are exempt from corporation tax. Dividends paid out of the trading profits of a company resident in an EU member state or a country with which Ireland has a DTT (or a country with which Ireland has ratified the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters) may be taxed at the 12.5% rate, provided a claim is made. The 12.5% corporation tax rate applies to the same type of dividends received from companies resident in non-treaty countries, provided the company paying the dividend is a listed company or is part of a 75% listed group the principal class of the shares of which are substantially and regularly traded on the Irish Stock Exchange, a recognised Stock Exchange in an EU member state or a country with which Ireland has a DTT, or on such other Stock Exchange as is approved by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of this relief from double taxation.
As outlined above, the 12.5% corporation tax rate is also applicable to foreign dividends paid out of trading profits of a company resident in a country that has ratified the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters.
Foreign dividends received by an Irish company where it holds 5% or less of the share capital and voting rights in that foreign company are exempt from corporation tax where the Irish company would otherwise be taxed on this dividend income as trading income.
Dividends from Irish resident companies are not liable to further tax, other than a surcharge on close company recipients where the dividend is not redistributed. Broadly speaking, a close company is a company that is under the control of five or fewer ‘participators’. Participators can include individual shareholders, corporate shareholders, loan creditors, any person with a right to receive distributions from the company, etc. Where not less than 35% of the shares of a company (including the voting power) are listed, a company will not be regarded as a close company.
A close company surcharge of 20% is payable on certain non-trading income (e.g. rental income, certain dividend income, interest income) if it is not distributed to shareholders within 18 months of the accounting period in which the income was earned. A close company making a distribution and the close company receiving a distribution have the option, jointly, to elect to have the dividend disregarded for surcharge purposes. This can give close companies the option of moving ‘trading income’ up to a holding company without incurring a surcharge. Generally speaking, close companies avoid the surcharge through the payment of dividends within the prescribed period. Capital gains accruing to a non-resident company that would be close if it were resident can be attributed to Irish resident participators in certain instances.
As outlined above, Finance Act 2024 introduced the participation exemption which applies to dividends or other distributions received as income from EEA/Treaty resident companies where certain conditions are met.
### Stock dividends
Stock dividends taken in lieu of cash are taxed on the shareholder based on an amount equivalent to the amount that would have been received if the option to take stock dividends had not been exercised. If the recipient is an Irish resident company and it receives the stock dividend from a quoted (listed) Irish company, then there will be no tax. For a quoted (listed) company paying the stock dividend, dividend WHT with the appropriate exemptions and exclusions applies. Other stock dividends (bonus issues) are generally non-taxable.
## Interest income
Interest income earned by Irish companies is generally taxable at the rate of tax for passive income of 25% (interest may be regarded as a trading receipt for certain financial trader companies). It is possible to offset current-year trading losses against passive interest income arising in the same year on a ‘value basis’. It is not possible to offset prior-year trading losses against current-year interest income unless that interest constitutes a trading receipt of the particular company.
## Royalty income
Royalty income earned by Irish companies is generally taxable at the rate of tax for passive income of 25%. However, where an Irish company is considered to be carrying on an IP trade, that company’s royalty and other similar income may be subjected to Irish tax at the corporation tax trading rate of 12.5%. Similarly to passive interest income, it is possible to offset current-year trading losses against passive royalty income arising in the same year on a ‘value basis’. It is not possible to offset prior-year trading losses against current-year royalty income unless that royalty constitutes a trading receipt of the particular company.
## Taxation of cryptocurrency
Irish Revenue have updated their Tax and Duty Manual (TDM) in relation to the taxation of crypto-asset transactions. Within this updated TDM, Irish Revenue outlined that the taxation of income received from, or charges made in connection with, crypto-assets will depend on the nature of the activity and the parties involved. Therefore, parties must apply general tax principles when assessing the taxation of cryptocurrency and each case must be considered on its own individual facts and circumstances and by looking at the relevant legislation and case law. The TDM states that the sale, transfer, or redemption of crypto-assets is most likely to be a disposal for capital gains tax purposes unless, based on the facts and circumstances, there is a trade of dealing in crypto-assets being carried on. The TDM also notes that a trade in crypto-assets would be similar to a trade in shares, securities, or other assets.
Crypto-assets that are provided to an employee or director free of charge or for a reduced amount will be treated as a normal benefit in kind. In addition, where an employee or director is given a right or option to acquire assets by their employer, which may include crypto-assets, Irish Revenue's view is that the Irish tax treatment of such options should be similar to the tax treatment of the right or option to acquire share options (including in respect of the tax and reporting obligations for both the employee and the employer).
## Emissions allowances
Irish legislation defines the tax treatment of emission allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The legislation distinguishes between allowances acquired free of charge from the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) under the EU Scheme and those that are purchased.
Emission allowances acquired free of charge from the EPA may not be subjected to taxation. Allowances that are purchased may be treated as trading assets, subject to corporation tax treatment.
## Foreign income
Resident companies are liable to Irish tax on worldwide income. Accordingly, in the case of an Irish resident company, foreign income and capital gains are, broadly speaking, subject to corporation tax in full. This applies to income of a foreign branch of an Irish company as well as to dividend income arising abroad.
In general, income of foreign subsidiaries of Irish companies is not taxed until remitted to Ireland, although there are special rules that seek to tax certain undistributed capital gains of non-resident close companies.
Foreign taxes borne by an Irish resident company (or Irish branch of an EEA resident company), whether imposed directly or by way of withholding, may be creditable in Ireland (_see Foreign tax credit in the section_).


# Ireland
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Corporation tax is chargeable as follows on income and capital gains:
Standard rate on income ('trading rate') | Higher rate on income ('passive rate') | Capital gains rate  
---|---|---  
12.5% | 25% | 33%  
Resident companies are taxable in Ireland on their worldwide profits (including gains). Non-resident companies are subject to Irish corporation tax only on the trading profits of an Irish branch or agency and to Irish income tax (generally by way of withholding) on certain Irish-source income.
Non-trading (passive) income includes dividends from companies tax resident outside Ireland (with some exceptions), interest, rents, and royalties. Legislation provides that certain dividend income (e.g. income from foreign trades) is taxed at 12.5% (_see the section_). The higher rate (i.e. 25%) also applies to income from a business carried on wholly outside Ireland and to income from land dealing, mining, and petroleum extraction operations.
An additional ‘profit resource rent’ tax applies to certain petroleum activities. Depending on the profit yield of a site, the tax rate applicable can range from 25% to 40%.
Close companies (_see the section_) may be subject to additional corporate taxes on undistributed investment income (including Irish dividends) and on undistributed income from professional services. Examples of professional services include professions such as solicitor, accountant, doctor, and engineer.
## Pillar Two 
Ireland legislated for the Pillar Two rules with effect from 1 January 2024 for the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and 1 January 2025 for the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR).
Pillar Two aims to ensure that in-scope businesses (those with consolidated group revenues of EUR 750 million or more in at least two of the four preceding fiscal years) pay at least a 15% effective tax rate on their profits in each jurisdiction they operate in. The Irish Pillar Two legislation is derived from the OECD model rules and the EU Directive. The rules are further supplemented through the OECD guidance. Guidance issued to date has been included in legislation.
The rules adopted in Irish Pillar Two legislation, which are derived from OECD Administrative Guidance, include the following provisions (not an exhaustive list):
  * Transitional CbC reporting safe harbour.
  * QDTT safe harbour.
  * UTPR safe harbour.


Ireland has implemented a QDTT via a short legislative provision linked very closely to the IIR and UTPR sections of the legislation. One key aspect of the Irish QDTT is that, where certain conditions are met, the QDTT is calculated using a local financial accounting standard and local financial accounts rather than the ultimate parent entity’s financial accounting standard used in the consolidated financial statements.
## Local income taxes
Ireland does not levy local or regional taxes on income.


# Ireland
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is charged at the standard rate of 23%. This is the default rate of VAT that applies to the supply of goods and services in the course or furtherance of business unless the goods or services qualify for a reduced rate of VAT, the zero-rate of VAT, or are exempt from VAT.
### Reduced VAT rates
There are currently two main reduced rates of VAT, being a reduced rate of 13.5% and a super-reduced rate of 9%. The 13.5% rate applies, _inter alia_ , to the supply and development of immovable goods, labour-intensive services (e.g. certain repair and related services), energy products and supplies, and the supply of certain food and drink provided in the course of catering. The 9% rate is applicable to the provision of facilities for taking part in sporting activities, the supply of periodicals (e.g. magazines, newsletters, sectoral publications) and the supply of certain electronically supplied matter (e.g. periodicals, brochures, catalogues, etc.). Finance Act 2024 has further extended the temporary application of the 9% rate of VAT to the supply of electricity and gas (which is ordinarily subject to the 13.5% rate) until 30 April 2025 and has also brought the supply and installation of low emission heat pump heating systems within the scope of the 9% rate of VAT.
### Zero-rate of VAT
The zero-rate of VAT applies to, _inter alia_ , the supply of goods dispatched from Ireland to a VAT-registered person in another EU member state (provided certain conditions are satisfied), goods exported from Ireland to a place outside of the European Union, the supply of certain food and drink of a kind used for human consumption, oral medicines, books and newspapers (printed and electronic and audiobooks),  the supply and installation of solar panels (on private dwellings and recognised schools) and children’s clothing and footwear.
### VAT exemption
Certain supplies are exempt from VAT. The exempt categories include certain activities in the public interest (e.g. postal services, medical and related services, education, and national broadcasting), financial services (e.g. certain banking services), insurance services, betting/gambling services, the letting of immovable goods (but an option to tax is possible, subject to certain conditions), and, by way of an Irish derogation from EU law, passenger transport services.
### VAT registration thresholds
With effect from 1 January 2024, the thresholds below which a person is not required to register for Irish VAT have increased. The turnover thresholds (which relate to turnover in any continuous 12-month period for taxable persons with an establishment in Ireland) will be increased as follows:
  * from EUR 40,000 to EUR 42,500 for the supply of services, and 
  * from EUR 80,000 to EUR 85,000 for the supply of goods (including for the supply of goods and services where at least 90% of the turnover is derived from the supply of goods).


### Central Electronic System of Payment Information (CESOP): New EU tax information reporting requirements
The CESOP Directive (Council Directive (EU) 2020/284) entered into effect on 1 January 2024 and requires payment service providers (PSPs) located in the European Union to collate electronic records on cross-border payments and report this data to relevant tax authorities in the European Union. The aim is to address VAT fraud in the European Union and will allow EU tax authorities to monitor payments made in respect of e-commerce transactions to ensure that they are taxed appropriately. 
The CESOP Directive will only apply to cross-border payments (i.e. domestic payments are excluded), and only PSPs (as defined) are within scope of the reporting requirements. PSPs will be required to file a return on a quarterly basis to the tax authorities in the member state of establishment or in the host member state. The first reporting period will run from 1 January 2024 to 31 March 2024. The filing deadline for the first period will be 30 April 2024.
Finance Act 2024 has introduced fixed penalties for PSPs who fail to comply with their CESOP reporting and record keeping obligations.
## Customs duties
Ireland is part of the customs territory of the European Union. Goods imported into Ireland from countries outside the European Union (including Great Britain) are liable to customs duty at the appropriate rates specified in the EU’s Combined Nomenclature (CN) Tariff. These rates vary from 0% to 14% for industrial goods, with much higher rates applicable to agricultural products. Imports may qualify for a partial or full reduction in rates in specific circumstances (e.g. where products meet relevant rules of origin and are considered as ‘originating’ under one of the many Free Trade Agreements that the European Union has negotiated with third countries, such as the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement).
The three main elements (‘customs duty drivers’) that determine the duty liability arising on goods imported into the European Union from a non-EU country are (i) the product’s commodity code (Tariff Classification), (ii) its customs valuation, and (iii) its origin. Each of these elements will need to be considered when determining the customs duty cost at import.
There are special customs procedures that allow for the import of goods into the European Union from non-EU countries with full or partial relief from customs duty or under a suspension of customs duty. Examples of these are Temporary Admission, Customs Warehousing, Inward Processing Relief, and Outward Processing Relief. There are different conditions attached to each customs special procedure, and an analysis of the trade footprint of the importer of the goods will need to be considered in order to determine whether or not they may avail of one of these reliefs. Advance authorisation is generally required from Irish Revenue to use such special procedures. These procedures are important and are in place with the intention of stimulating economic activity within the European Union.
It should be noted that no customs duties arise on goods ‘imported’ from other EU member states (known as Intra-Community movements), provided the products are in ‘free circulation’ in another member state of the European Union.
### Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM): The EU's new carbon charge
A new CBAM entered into effect in all EU member states from October 2023. The aim of CBAM is to mitigate against carbon leakage whereby companies based in the European Union import carbon-intensive products as part of their manufacturing processes that work against domestic measures introduced in the European Union to tackle carbon intensive manufacturing. It also will encourage more sustainable industrial production outside the European Union. The key products impacted by CBAM are cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen. 
The new measure is underpinned by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. CBAM will enter into force on a phased, transitional basis. The reporting obligations for the transitional phase are set out in Regulation (EU) 2023/1773. The transitional phase applies from 1 October 2023, and CBAM reports will be required on a quarterly basis until 31 December 2025. Annual declarations will then replace quarterly declarations from 1 January 2026, when the measures enter into force on a permanent basis (which will have a financial impact whereby impacted companies will be required to purchase CBAM certificates related to the amount of embedded carbon emissions in their imported products).
## Excise duties
Excise duties are charged on mineral oils (including petrol and diesel) which includes a carbon charge component (_see below_), alcohol products (including spirits, beer, wine, cider, and perry), and tobacco products where they are consumed in Ireland. Reduced rates of excise duty may apply when setting up a microbrewery in Ireland (depending on production quantities). Similarly, Ireland has also introduced a relief for micro-producers of ciders and perry. Relief from alcohol products tax also applies to alcohol intended for use or to have been used in the production of flavours for the preparation either of foodstuffs or of beverages not exceeding 1.2% vol., medicinal products, vinegar, and other specified products. 
In addition, a diesel rebate scheme applies in Ireland. It provides hauliers or coach/bus owners with an opportunity to claim a partial refund of excise duty paid on fuel used in specifically designated vehicles for the purposes of transporting goods or passengers.
Excise duties are not charged in Ireland on the export or sale of excisable goods to other EU countries, but special control arrangements apply to the intra-EU movement of such goods.
In addition, Ireland applies excise duties to electricity, betting (including so-called 'free bets' and discounted bets on what would have been the unit stake), natural gas and solid fuel in the form of a carbon charge (_see below_), sugar (_see below_), and the first registration of vehicles in the state (the latter is known as VRT).
The VRT regime for motor vehicles is based on a CO2 emissions rating system and charged on the ‘open market selling price’ of the vehicle. A more robust system of calculating emissions was introduced with effect from 1 January 2021, to increase the VRT for vehicles with higher CO2 emissions. Specific reductions in VRT apply to electric and hybrid vehicles, subject to certain conditions being met. In addition, there are reliefs available for cars imported temporarily by non-residents, or imported on transfer of residence to Ireland (such VRT reliefs require prior approval from the Customs authorities).
Penalties also apply for breaches of excise legislation. 
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is a tax on instruments. It is payable on transfers of land and on other assets where legal title cannot be passed by delivery. It is chargeable on instruments of transfer executed in Ireland and on instruments, wherever executed, that relate to Irish property or relate to matters done or to be done in Ireland. Stamp duty on the transfer of assets between associated companies may be fully relieved from stamp duty, provided the following key conditions are met:
  * The companies have a 90% relationship (that is, one company is, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner of at least 90% of the ordinary share capital of the other and is entitled to at least 90% of the profits available for distribution and at least 90% of the assets in the case of a winding-up of the other company, or a third company has these rights, directly or indirectly, in respect of both companies).
  * This relationship is maintained for a period of at least two years after the transfer of the assets (to prevent the relief being clawed back). There are certain limited exceptions to this two-year association requirement.


There is an exemption for transfers of intellectual property (IP), and the categories of IP qualifying for this exemption are the exact same as those for which IP capital allowances are available (_see Intellectual property [IP] regime in the_ _section_).
Stamp duty is payable based on the higher of the consideration paid for the transfer or the market value of the assets transferring. Rates of 1% to 15% apply for transfers of residential property, 7.5% for transfers of non-residential property (commercial/industrial land and buildings, but also business assets, such as goodwill, debtors, contracts, etc.), and 1% on transfers of shares. A 7.5% rate applies for shares in certain companies deriving their value from Irish non-residential property, and a 10% rate applies for shares in certain companies deriving their value from Irish houses or duplexes, where particular circumstances exist.
## Capital duty on share capital
Ireland does not levy capital duty on share capital of companies.
## Capital taxes
Ireland does not levy tax on the net worth of companies.
## Payroll taxes
The ‘pay-as-you-earn’ system (PAYE system) places an obligation on employers to make deductions at source of income tax, universal social charge (USC), and pay-related social insurance (PRSI) from payments made to employees and an obligation to remit such deductions to the Irish tax authorities.
## Pay-related social insurance (PRSI)
Employed persons are compulsorily insured under a state-administered scheme of PRSI. Contributions are made by both the employer and the employee. The employer is responsible for making PRSI contributions up to a rate of 11.05%, and these are an allowable deduction for corporation tax purposes.
## Levies on insurance policies
A levy of 3% of gross premiums received by insurers applies in respect of non-life insurance policies relating to risks located in Ireland. This levy is payable four times _per annum_ , within 25 days of the end of each quarter (i.e. within 25 days from quarters ending 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December).
An additional contribution of 2% to the Insurance Compensation Fund applies to premiums received in relation to non-life insurance policies. Similar to the 3% non-life insurance levy, the contribution applies where premiums are received in respect of risks located in Ireland. The contribution is also payable four times _per annum_ in conjunction with the non-life insurance levy on premiums.
A levy of 1% of gross premiums received by insurers applies in relation to certain classes of life insurance policies relating to risks located in Ireland. This levy is payable four times _per annum_ , within 25 days of the end of each quarter (i.e. within 25 days from quarters ending 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December).
Reinsurance business is excluded from both of these levies.
There is also a stamp duty liability of EUR 1 on each new non-life insurance policy where the risk is located in Ireland.
A 1% contribution applies to all motor insurer premiums generated to directly fund the Motor Insurers’ Insolvency Compensation Fund (MIICF). The purpose of the MIICF is to build up a reserve fund, administered by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI), to ensure that outstanding policyholder claims can be met in the event that a motor insurer goes into liquidation. It is anticipated that the additional levy will be in place for several years in order to build up the necessary reserves totalling EUR 200 million. The levy was reduced from 2% to 1% on 1 January 2024, and, once fully funded, the rate is expected to reduce to 0%.
Certain voluntary health insurance policies are subject to risk equalisation fixed levies. Risk equalisation is a process that aims to equitably neutralise differences in insurers’ costs that arise due to variations in the age profile of the insured. The levies are updated regularly and currently (on or after 1 April 2023) range from EUR 36 to EUR 438 per policy, depending on your age profile and the type of coverage.
## Environmental taxes
In Ireland, a levy of 22 cents per bag is imposed upon consumers provided with a plastic bag when purchasing goods in supermarkets and other retail outlets. Under the applicable legislation, retailers are obligated to collect 22 cents in respect of every plastic bag or bag containing plastic, regardless of size, unless specifically exempted, that is provided to customers and remit all plastic bag levies collected to Irish Revenue. As a result of the levy, most non-supermarket retailers provide paper carrier bags, and same retailers sell ‘bags for life’, which are made from non-plastic material and, therefore, not subject to the environmental levy.
On 1 February 2024, Ireland introduced a deposit return scheme. Under the scheme, when a customer purchases a plastic bottle or aluminium or steel can that features the return log, the customer pays a deposit of between 15 cent and 25 cent in addition to the price of the drink. When that empty, undamaged container is returned to any retail outlet, the customer will be refunded the deposit in full. The deposit payable depends on the size of the container.
## Carbon tax
Finance Act 2024 provided for a carbon tax increase of EUR 7.50, up from EUR 56 to EUR 63.50, per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. A carbon tax is levied on mineral oils (e.g. auto fuels, kerosene) that are supplied in Ireland. The rate of carbon tax on oil and gas broadly equates to EUR 63.50 per tonne of CO2 emitted from 9 October 2024 for auto fuels and from 1 May 2025 for all other fuels, and the government has committed to increasing this to EUR 100 by 2030. Relief applies where mineral oils are supplied to an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) installation, to combined heat and power plants, or used for electricity generation. Pure biofuels are exempt from carbon tax. There is full relief for the biofuel component of the fuel. Where biofuel has been mixed or blended with any other mineral oil, the relief from carbon taxes shall apply to the biofuel content of the mixture or blend, regardless of the percentage.
A carbon tax is also levied on natural gas and solid fuel where supplied for combustion. Again, reliefs apply where these fuels are supplied to ETS installations or used in electricity generation, chemical reduction, or in the electrolytic or metallurgical processes.
## Sugar tax
Sugar Tax applies on a volumetric basis at one of the following rates:
  * EUR 16.26 per hectolitre on drinks where the sugar content is five or more grams of sugar per 100ml.
  * EUR 24.39 per hectolitre on drinks where the sugar content is eight or more grams of sugar per 100ml.


## Exit tax
The exit tax applies not only to the migration of tax residence of a company from Ireland, but also in respect of certain transfers of assets from Ireland to other countries where the same company retains legal or economic ownership of those transferred assets. The provisions deem a company that is resident in an EU member state other than Ireland to have disposed of and immediately reacquired at market value:
  * assets transferred by it from a PE in Ireland to its head office or to a PE in another country, or
  * business assets transferred by it on the transfer of a business carried on by a PE in Ireland to another country.


The provisions also deem a company migrating its tax residence from Ireland to another EU member state or to a third country to have disposed of all of its assets (subject to certain exceptions) and to immediately reacquire them at market value.
The company is entitled to deduct the tax base cost held in the relevant assets in calculating the gain arising.
Subject to certain anti-avoidance rules, the tax rate applicable to any chargeable gain arising is 12.5%.
Exemption from the charge to exit tax may be available in respect of a range of assets, subject to certain conditions being met. These include:
  * assets that remain situated in Ireland and are used in an Irish trade post migration
  * assets that are given as security for a debt, assets that are transferred to satisfy capital requirements or for liquidity purposes, and assets that relate to the financing of securities, in circumstances where those assets are due to revert to the Irish PE or company within 12 months of the transfer, and
  * certain ‘specified’ assets that remain within the charge to Irish capital gains tax post migration, including Irish land and buildings and unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from such assets.


An exception applies relating to interest on deferred payments of the exit tax. Companies have the right, in certain circumstances, to pay the exit tax in equal annual instalments over five years. Interest applies over the period of deferral. The amendment ensures that the calculation of interest on instalment payments operates as intended. 
## Local taxes
Local taxes, known as ‘rates’, are not based on income but rather are levied on the occupiers of business property by reference to a deemed rental value of the property concerned. The level of rates levied can depend on the region in which the property is located. Rates are an allowable deduction for corporation tax purposes.
Local authorities are also empowered to levy charges on all occupiers for specific services (e.g. water supply). These charges are also deductible for corporation tax purposes.
