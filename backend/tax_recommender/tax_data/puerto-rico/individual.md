Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Foreign tax relief
Puerto Rican residents may claim a credit against their tax liability (subject to limitations) for income taxes paid to foreign countries (including the United States and any state of the United States). 
Non-resident individuals are not entitled to a credit for foreign taxes.
## Tax treaties
There are no tax treaties between foreign countries and Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has recognised that Puerto Rico is not a signatory party to a treaty entered into by the United States; if an international treaty does not explicitly include Puerto Rico, the treaty will not be applicable to Puerto Rico.

## Act 257
Act No. 257, signed by the Governor of Puerto Rico on 10 December 2018, amends the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended (the 'Code'). This law will apply for the years beginning after 31 December 2018 unless noted. All changes provided by this Act were incorporated in each section of this summary in detail along with any technical amendments as of January 2021.
## Act 22 - The Individual Investors Act
Act 22 (as amended by Act 60 of 2019), also known as The Individual Investors Act, was approved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico during 2012. The purpose of these measures is to provide incentives to individuals who have not been residents of Puerto Rico to become residents. In order to encourage the transfer of such individuals to Puerto Rico, the Act exempts from Puerto Rico income tax their passive income, which may consist of interest, dividends, and capital gains. _See the_ _section for more information_.
## Act 52
Act No. 52, signed by the Governor of Puerto Rico on 30 June 2022, amends the 'Code' among other tax laws. Amendments affecting individual taxpayers include the reporting of foreign financial bank accounts, estimated tax payment requirements for salaried remote workers, and married filing status for the tax year when a taxpayer is widowed.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
Puerto Rican residents are taxed in Puerto Rico on their worldwide income, no matter where the income is sourced. Puerto Rican non-residents are only taxed in Puerto Rico on their Puerto Rico-source income. Income for services performed is sourced to Puerto Rico based on where the services are performed. Such income is typically prorated to Puerto Rico based on workdays.
Puerto Rico has a _de minimis_ rule to avoid sourcing to Puerto Rico very small amounts of income from personal services. Income from personal services performed within Puerto Rico will not be considered from Puerto Rican sources if it is 3,000 United States dollars (USD) or less and the individual was present in Puerto Rico for 90 days or less during the calendar year (such personal services must have been provided to an employer who is not engaged in a trade or business in Puerto Rico).
## Personal income tax rates
The following regular tax rates remain in effect for 2018 and future years:
Net taxable income (USD) | Tax  
---|---  
Not over 9,000 | 0%  
Over 9,000, but not over 25,000 | 7% of the excess over USD 9,000  
Over 25,000, but not over 41,500 | USD 1,120 plus 14% of the excess over USD 25,000  
Over 41,500, but not over 61,500 | USD 3,430 plus 25% of the excess over USD 41,500  
Over 61,500 | USD 8,430 plus 33% of the excess over USD 61,500  
## Gradual adjustment tax
If the individual's net taxable income exceeds USD 500,000, they will have to pay an additional tax (i.e. gradual adjustment tax). This tax is 5% of the excess of the total net taxable income over USD 500,000, limited to 33% of their personal and dependents' exemption plus USD 8,895.
## Alternate basic tax (ABT)
In addition to the regular income tax, individuals are required to compute an ABT assessed in accordance to the below tax table. The ABT taxable income is computed by adding back certain income items exempt from regular income tax. 
### ABT rates:
Net income subject to ABT (USD) | Tax (%)  
---|---  
In excess of 25,000 but not more than 50,000 | 1  
In excess of 50,000 but not more than 75,000 | 3  
In excess of 75,000 but not more than 150,000 | 5  
In excess of 150,000 but not more than 250,000 | 10  
In excess of 250,000 | 24  
The credit for prior years’ ABT liability may not be sold, transferred, or refunded. When determining the net income subject to ABT, this credit will be reduced by the portion of the ABT attributable to non-deductible expenses.
The ABT will not be applicable to individuals whose only source of income is from salaries informed in a Withholding Statement.
For tax years after 31 December 2019, an individual's total tax will be 95% of one's total tax determined (regular tax plus gradual adjustment) if gross income exceeds USD 100,000. If gross income is USD 100,000 or less, then the individuals total tax will be 92% of one's total tax determined.
### New optional tax for self-employed individuals rendering services
Self-employed individuals whose income is derived substantially from the business of rendering services may elect to pay an optional tax on gross income instead of the income tax otherwise imposed by the Code on net income, as follows:
Gross income (USD) | Tax (%)  
---|---  
Not greater than 100,000 | 6  
In excess of 100,000 but not more than 200,000 | 10  
In excess of 200,000 but not more than 300,000 | 13  
In excess of 300,000 but not more than 400,000 | 15  
In excess of 400,000 but not more than 500,000 | 17  
In excess of 500,000 | 20  
The income received must be substantially from the provision of services. For these purposes, accrued income will be considered to come substantially from services rendered when said income category represents at least 80% of the total gross income received during the taxable year.
In addition, to use the optional computation of tax, the total gross self-employment income must be subject to withholding at source or to estimated tax payments and must be reported in an Informative Return.
The new optional tax is applicable for taxable years that commence after 31 December 2018.


# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Taxable period
The tax year in Puerto Rico is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
In most cases, taxpayers must file an individual income tax return on a calendar-year basis by 15 April of the following year. Filing of returns, availability of deductions, and applicability of tax rates depends on residency and US citizenship. 
An automatic extension of time to file is granted (upon request) if submitted by 15 April. This extension is for six months.
The following three categories of filing status are available for taxpayers: 
  * Individual: includes (i) unmarried individuals; (ii) married individuals who are separated for a continuous period of 12 months, including the last day of the tax year, and that have been living in separate households for an uninterrupted period of 183 days (within the continuous 12-month period); and (iii) married taxpayers with pre-nuptial agreements expressly stating that the marriage would follow total asset separation.
  * Married taxpayers living together and filing jointly.
  * Married taxpayers living together and filing separately.


For tax years after 31 December 2018, the obligation to file a Puerto Rico income tax return will be triggered when gross income minus the exemptions allowed under the Code is more than USD 0, unless the total income tax was withheld at source. Taxpayers are also required to file a tax return if the net income subject to ABT is USD 25,000 or more.
## Payment of tax
Puerto Rico follows a 'pay as you go' withholding mechanism to fund income taxes on compensation throughout the year. For Puerto Rican residents, the employer will compute the income tax withholding for each employee based on the information provided by the employee on a specific form and with tables or percentage methods provided by the PR Treasury Department.
Puerto Rican employees who are non-residents are subject to a flat 29% withholding in the case of foreign nationals and to a 20% withholding in the case of US citizens.
In the case of a Puerto Rican resident who provides services (rather than as an employee) to another resident person, the income earned while providing such services will be subject to a withholding flat rate of 10%. Such withholding tax (WHT) rate does not apply to the first USD 500 of income earned by the individual who provides the services.
Puerto Rican resident taxpayers with income not subject to withholding (e.g. self-employment income, capital gains, rent) must generally make quarterly payments of estimated tax due 15 April, 15 June, 15 September, and 15 January. If the taxpayer's balance due will be at least USD 1,000, the taxpayer will be subject to the payment of quarterly payments of estimated tax. Any balance of tax owed is due 15 April of the following year.
## Foreign bank account report
Act No. 52 of 2022, enacted 30 June 2022, introduced to PR tax laws the requirement for individual PR residents to report information regarding financial accounts maintained outside Puerto Rico or the United States in which they have a financial interest and whose maximum value during the tax year exceeded USD 10,000.
Foreign financial accounts can be bank accounts, broker accounts, future or options contract accounts, crypto asset accounts, cash value insurance accounts, investment accounts, or any other account where funds are held outside Puerto Rico or the United States. An individual is considered as having a financial interest in an account when: they are the owner, the owner is a third party acting on behalf of the individual, the owner is an entity in which the individual directly or indirectly owns at least 50% of all their value or voting power, the owner is a grantor trust for the individual’s benefit, or the individual has signature authority over the assets.
An individual that does not comply with foreign financial accounts reporting provisions will incur a penalty of USD 10,000 per report. The Secretary may publish regulations or communications to consider individuals in compliance with these provisions through the filing of the federal foreign financial accounts reports, Form 8938, and FinCEN Form 114.


# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Itemised deductions
Puerto Rican residents and non-resident US citizens can claim the following itemised deductions to reduce their gross income. Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals may not claim these deductions.
### Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions will be allowed as a deduction to the extent they are made to charitable organisations qualified by the Secretary and provide services to residents of Puerto Rico.
The contributions are subject to 50% of adjusted gross income (AGI).
### Education expenses
Interest paid on student loans for qualified individuals is deductible, as are contributions to Puerto Rican educational individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
### Medical expenses
Qualified medical expenses in excess of 6% of AGI are allowed as deductions.
### Mortgage interest
Mortgage interest paid on qualified residential property is deductible, limited to USD 35,000 or 30% of AGI, whichever is lower.
### Retirement plans
Contributions to Puerto Rican IRAs are deductible, limited to USD 5,000 per individual in addition to contributions made to employer sponsored qualified retirement plans. Contributions to government retirement systems are also deductible.
For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2018, contributions to governmental pension or retirement systems will be considered a reduction to the taxable wages, instead of an itemised deduction available in the tax return.
### Casualty losses
Casualty losses on a primary residence and certain personal property can be claimed as deductions.
### Health Savings Account contributions
Contributions to a Health Savings Account will not be allowed as itemised deductions.
## Standard deductions
There is no standard deduction in Puerto Rico.
## Personal exemptions
The personal exemption is USD 3,500 per individual and USD 7,000 for married taxpayers living together and filing jointly.
The exemption for each dependant is USD 2,500.
The veteran's exemption is USD 1,500.
Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals are not allowed any exemptions.
## Net operating loss (NOL) deduction
For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2018, the NOL carryforward allowed will be increased from 80% to 90% of the net income.
The current 50% limitation on the NOL carryover for individuals with a net loss in a trade or business for three consecutive taxable years is eliminated, thus allowing a 100% NOL carryover.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Employment income
Employment income includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for rendered services, and received in any form of payment (i.e. cash or in kind), unless specifically excluded. Typically, taxable compensation includes salaries, wages, Christmas bonus, incentive compensation, benefits in kind, etc.
Reimbursement of expenses incurred by the employee to carry out their duties or responsibilities may be considered business expenses. For example, if an employee must travel for business meetings to another location where they must stay overnight, the expenses incurred for travel and lodging in such a case are generally considered business expenses incurred on behalf of the employer. The reimbursement of these expenses may be excluded from compensation if certain requirements are met.
## Capital gains and investment income
All capital gains and investment income of a Puerto Rican resident are taxable for Puerto Rican purposes.
### Capital gains
The holding period to qualify as long-term capital gain will depend on the date of sale or exchange. Long-term tax treatment will apply to those capital assets held for more than one year.
Long-term capital gains are subject to a special tax rate of 15%. Short-term capital gains are subject to the regular gradual rates.
In the case of long-term capital gains, Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals are subject to a flat withholding rate of 25%. Puerto Rican non-resident US citizens are only subject to a flat withholding rate of 15% on long-term capital gains.
### Investment income
Investment income is subject to regular gradual rates unless specific requirements are met. For example, interest may be subject to a flat rate of 10% or 17% and dividends to a flat rate of 15%.
In the case of Puerto Rican non-resident foreign nationals, investment income, such as rent and interest income, is subject to a flat rate of 29%, and dividends to a flat rate of 15% (or a lower flat rate in certain cases).


# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Act 132 - Real Property Market Stimulus Act 
On 2 September 2010, Act 132, Real Property Market Stimulus Act, was enacted to create an incentive program to facilitate the purchase of homes and other real property by granting different exemptions from taxation on property tax and income tax. In particular, this act aims to encourage the purchase of newly constructed residential real property suitable for family life that has not been subject to occupation, without limiting its application to property acquired to be the principal residence of the purchaser.
The act provides for 100% exemption from income tax (as well as exemption from the ABT) for a period of up to 15 years beginning on 1 January 2011 and ending on 31 December 2025 for rental income received on residential property leased. The tax exemption provided will apply to income earned, both with respect to leases that are signed after the enactment of this Act, including those signed after 30 June 2011, as well as contracts that were already signed at the time of approval of this Act. Therefore, rental income subject to this exemption will also be exempt from income tax withholding at source. To be able to benefit from this exemption, the lessor still needs to include in their Puerto Rico income tax return the income earned as well as the location of the property leased and reflect the income as exempt. Otherwise, the net rental income will be subject to tax per the regular provisions established by the Code.
## Act 22 - The Individual Investors Act (now included under Act 60 of PR Tax Incentive Code of July 2019)
Act 22 (as amended), also known as The Individual Investors Act, was approved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico during 2012. The purpose of this Act is to provide incentives to individuals who have not been residents of Puerto Rico to become residents. In order to encourage the transfer of such individuals to Puerto Rico, the Act exempts from Puerto Rico income tax their passive income, which may consists of interest, dividends, and capital gains.
The Act applies to all individual investors who become 'Puerto Rico Residents' on or before 31 December 2035, provided that such individuals were not residents of Puerto Rico at any time during the ten-year period preceding the effective date of the Act (last date amended: 1 July 2019).
Both US and non-US citizens may qualify under the Act. Puerto Rico residents who are temporarily outside of Puerto Rico do not qualify as they are still deemed to be Puerto Rico residents.
To qualify for the exemptions granted under the Act, every so-called Resident Individual Investor (i.e. a tax resident qualifying under the Act) must request a tax exemption decree from the Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce. The tax exemption decree will provide details of the tax treatment and shall be considered a contract between the Resident Individual Investor and the Puerto Rico government.
The decree may be revoked by the Secretary if any of the following events occur:
  * The Resident Individual Investor fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by the Act or its regulation, or by the terms of the decree.
  * The Resident Individual Investor ceases to comply with his or her tax responsibilities under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code (PR Code) and other laws of Puerto Rico.
  * The decree was obtained based on false or fraudulent representations of any facts or circumstances, which, in whole or in part, motivated the issuance of the decree.


### Exemption period
The income tax exemption will apply only to investment income recognised during the period that starts on the date the individual is domiciled in Puerto Rico and ends on 31 December 2035 (exemption period). After this date, those residents who took advantage of the exemptions granted will be taxed as any other Puerto Rico resident and as stated in the PR Code.
### Investment income exempt under the Act
Interest and dividend income received by Resident Individual Investors during the exemption period will be fully exempt from PR income taxation. The exemption applies to all sources of such income (i.e. Puerto Rico, United States, and foreign).
In the case of capital gains, the Act provides for either a full PR income tax exemption or a reduced tax rate, depending on certain requirements.
## Act 257
### Earned Income Credit (EIC)
For taxable years beginning after 31 December 2019, taxpayers who are residents of Puerto Rico during the entire year who are 27 years old and beyond will be entitled to claim the EIC.
The credit will range from 5% to 12.5% of the gross earned income (subject to limitations) depending on the amount of dependants claimed by the taxpayer.
The credit is not available for married taxpayers filing separate tax returns.


# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
The term 'resident individual' means an individual who is domiciled in Puerto Rico. It should be presumed that an individual is a resident of Puerto Rico if they have been present in Puerto Rico for a period of 183 days during the calendar year. However, individuals deriving income for services performed within Puerto Rico may be subject to taxation in Puerto Rico even though such individuals may have not been physically present in Puerto Rico for at least 183 days (i.e. 'non-resident individual').


# Puerto Rico
## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
## Social security contributions
Puerto Rico is covered under the US social security system; consequently, Puerto Rico employers and employees are subject to the US Social Security and Medicare taxes requirements. _See the section in the United States Individual tax summary for more information_.
## Consumption taxes
### Sales and use tax (SUT)
SUT is imposed at 10.5% at the state level and an additional 1% at the municipal level, for an aggregate tax of 11.5%. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Puerto Rico does not have a net wealth/worth tax.
## Property taxes
The property tax system is administered by the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (MRCC). The tax on real property is directly assessed by the MRCC and may be paid in two instalments. The tax, which varies depending on the municipality, is applied to an amount based on the hypothetical fair market value (FMV) of the relevant property in the year 1957. In general terms, this hypothetical FMV normally ranges between 40% and 50% of the cost of the property.
## Luxury and excise taxes 
There are certain articles subject to a special excise tax, such as cigarettes, fuels, crude oils, vehicles, alcoholic beverages, cement, sugar, and plastic products, among others. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Payroll taxes
Puerto Rico employers are required to withhold from their employees certain payroll taxes in addition to the withholding for income tax. These payroll taxes are: Social Security and Medicare taxes, disability benefits tax, and chauffeur's and other employees' employment security tax. There are also payroll taxes only borne by the employer and should not be deducted from the employee's wages, such as: unemployment insurance tax (Puerto Rico and Federal) and workmen's accident compensation insurance tax.
All payroll taxes are required for Puerto Rican resident individuals. However, some payroll taxes may also be required for Puerto Rican non-resident US citizen or foreign national individuals.
