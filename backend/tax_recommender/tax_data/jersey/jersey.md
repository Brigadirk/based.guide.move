# Jersey, Channel Islands
## Overview
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
The Channel Islands, located in the English Channel, are constitutionally separate from the United Kingdom and France and, to all intents and purposes, are self-governing. Jersey, a British Crown dependency, is the largest of the Channel Islands. It is divided into 12 parishes, with Saint Helier as the capital. The official language of Jersey is English, and the currency is the British pound sterling (GBP). The state of Jersey is an effective legislator and government and ‘runs’ the island at a local level.
Jersey is one of the world’s major international finance centres, with a stable political, legal, and fiscal infrastructure and government. The Island is well regulated and has high standards of international telecommunications, information technology, postal, and courier services.
