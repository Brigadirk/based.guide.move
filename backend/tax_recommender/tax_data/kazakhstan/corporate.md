## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
On 12 December 2023, the President of Kazakhstan signed a law introducing the following significant changes in the Kazakhstan Tax Code entering into force on 1 January 2024 (including retrospective changes):
  * Tax deduction of expenses related to purchase of ‘intangible’ services from affiliated non-resident parties, registered in blacklisted countries, is limited as an adjustment of the taxable income within the amount not exceeding 3% of the taxable income. The Law defines expenses on ‘intangible’ services as costs of management, consulting, audit, design, legal, accounting, advocacy, advertising, marketing, franchising, financial (except for interest expenses), engineering, agency services, royalties, and transfer of intellectual property (IP) rights (retrospective from 1 January 2023).


  * Dividend income on securities that are listed on the official stock exchanges functioning on the territory of Kazakhstan is exempt from taxation irrespective of whether such securities were traded on the stock exchange or not. The change in taxation was applied in a retrospective way from 1 January of 2023. 
  * Interest income of non-residents on securities that are listed on the official stock exchanges functioning on the territory of Kazakhstan is subject to exemption from taxation at the source of payment only if there is trading on the stock exchange within the tax period in accordance with the criteria determined by the Kazakhstan government.
  * The list of types of income that are not income from a source of the Republic of Kazakhstan, subject to reflection in tax reporting, has been increased by the following types of income:
    * The amount of income tax calculated from the income of a non-resident and paid to the budget by the tax agent at one’s own expense without withholding such income tax. 
    * Compensation for expenses management members incurred in connection with the performance of the management duties assigned to them by the resident (e.g. travel expenses, rental housing, daily allowances.).
    * Non-resident income received from autonomous, non-profit organisations, as well as Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) authorities and organisations.
    * The value of property received in the form of a contribution to the authorised capital of a non-resident, as well as the value of property received by a non-resident issuer from the placement of shares issued by it.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Kazakhstan is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Annual CIT declarations are due by 31 March of the year following the tax year-end. However, a taxpayer may take a 30 calendar-day extension of the deadline upon request.
Certain taxpayers are required to submit their estimated calculations of monthly advance payments of CIT.
The deadline for the majority of other tax returns is the 15th calendar day of the second month following the reporting period (usually the calendar quarter). However, a taxpayer may take a 15 calendar-day extension of the deadline upon request.
## Payment of tax
CIT advance payments are due every 25th day of the month. Taxpayers with aggregate annual income during the tax period preceding the previous tax period of less than 325,000 times the MCI established for the relevant financial year (approximately USD 2.6 million) are exempt from the obligation to calculate and pay CIT advance payments. Payment of any outstanding CIT liabilities is required within ten calendar days following the submission of the annual CIT declaration (i.e. 10 April).
Most other taxes are payable by the 25th day of the second month following the end of the reporting period (calendar quarter).
### Fines and interest penalties
Late payment interest is calculated at 1.25 times the base rate set by the National Bank per day of delay. Starting from 22 January 2024, the National Bank base rate has been set at 15.25% _per annum_.
Substantial fines are imposed for understatement of tax liabilities. Generally, the fines amount to 80% of the understated tax, with lower rates for small and medium-sized businesses.
For advance CIT payments, an administrative fine of 20% applies for understated advance tax payments as compared to the finally declared CIT, provided the understated amount is greater than 20% of the final declared amount.
If a taxpayer is deemed to have concealed taxable income, a fine of up to 200% of the concealed amount may be assessed. Small and medium-sized businesses have lower rates.
## Tax audit process
Kazakhstan tax authorities have the right to conduct regular tax audits (at least once a year). There are two types of audits, selective and unplanned.
The tax authorities choose taxpayers for selective audits based on special risk assessment criteria. Information about misstatements in tax returns or any other discrepancy may trigger an unplanned tax audit.
From 2019, taxpayers (tax agents) are categorised by their activity as low, medium, or high risk, represented respectively with green, yellow, or red colour.
With respect to violations identified as a result of tax audit, the Tax Code introduced the following risk classification violations, for which various methods for elimination are provided:
  * For high risk: Notification of the elimination of violations.
  * For medium risk: Notification of violations.


The level of tax control for low-risk taxpayers is minimised.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations for tax purposes in Kazakhstan is three years (a five-year statute of limitations period applies to all large taxpayers); it may be extended up to seven years in the part relating to transfer pricing matters. For taxpayers operating under subsurface use contracts, the tax authorities maintain the right to assess or revise the assessed amount of EPT and other taxes and obligatory payments to the state budget, where a methodology of calculation uses one of the following indices: internal rate of return (IRR) or internal revenue rate or R-factor (earning yield), during the effective period of a subsurface use contract and five years after the end of the effective period of the subsurface use contract.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Tax audits may be comprehensive or thematic. Comprehensive tax audits cover all applicable taxes, while thematic tax audits may cover only some specific tax liabilities. As a rule, the Kazakhstan tax authorities are form, rather than substance, driven during tax audits.


# Kazakhstan
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Generally, Kazakhstan incorporated companies or other legal entities that have their place of effective management located in Kazakhstan are treated as Kazakhstan tax residents.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Non-resident legal entities having business activities in Kazakhstan may create a PE in the following cases:
  * 'Fixed place PE': A non-resident enterprise carries on business activities in Kazakhstan through a fixed place, including, but not limited to, through a place of management.
  * 'Services PE': A non-resident enterprise renders services in Kazakhstan through employees or other personnel engaged by the non-resident for such purposes, provided that these activities continue for more than 183 days within any consecutive 12-month period for the same or connected projects.
  * 'Construction PE': A construction site, for instance, a shop or an assembly facility, performance of projecting work form a PE, notwithstanding the timing of performing such operations.
  * 'Agency PE': A non-resident enterprise carries on business activities in Kazakhstan through a dependent agent. A dependent agent is an individual or a legal entity that meets all of the following criteria simultaneously: 
    * Has the contractual authority to represent the non-resident’s interests in Kazakhstan and makes use of this authority by acting and signing (negotiating) contracts on behalf of the non-resident (i.e. conclusion of a contract for provision of services or playing a principal role in concluding of such contract or having the ownership right [right to use] for property belonging to the non-resident).
    * The business is carried on outside the activity of either a customs broker or a professional participant of the securities market or other brokerage type of business (except for activity of an insurance broker).
    * Carries on activities that are not limited to those of a preparatory and auxiliary nature.




# Kazakhstan
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Allowable deductions generally include expenses associated with activities designed to generate income, unless specifically restricted for deduction by the tax legislation. All expenses require supporting documentation.
Recognition of expenses is performed in accordance with IFRS and Kazakhstan accounting and financial reporting legislation, unless otherwise stated in new Tax Code. If recognition of expenses as per IFRS differs from the new Tax Code, the latter should prevail.
## Depreciation and depletion
Tax depreciation is calculated using the declining-balance method at depreciation rates ranging from 10% to 40%, applied to the balances of four basic categories of assets:
  * Buildings and facilities (except for oil and gas wells and transmission facilities): 10%.
  * Machinery and equipment (except for machines and equipment for oil and gas production, computers, and equipment for information processing): 25%.
  * Computers and equipment for information processing: 40%.
  * Fixed assets not included in other groups, including oil and gas wells, transmission equipment, oil and gas machinery and equipment: 15%.


## Goodwill
There are no special provisions in the Kazakhstan Tax Code with respect to deductibility of goodwill expenses.
In general, assets not subject to amortisation per financial accounting are not regarded as fixed assets and are not subject to deduction.
## Start-up expenses
The Kazakhstan Tax Code does not specifically address deductibility of start-up expenses, but, generally, expenses incurred in relation to business activities and aimed at earning revenue occurring at start-up should be deductible.
## Interest expenses
Interest payable to unrelated third parties is deducted in full, except for interest payable to banks and micro-financial institutions, which are deducted within the amounts of actually paid interest. _For information about taxation of interest paid to related parties, please refer to Thin capitalisation in the section._
## Bad debt
Receivables that were not paid within three years are to be recognised as bad debt expenses. Such expenses can be deducted in full by a taxpayer, provided that (i) these receivables are reflected in books of the taxpayer and (ii) proper supporting documents are in place.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are entitled to decrease the taxable base but are capped at 4% of a company’s annual taxable income (the rate for the large taxpayers subject to monitoring is 3%).
## Foreign exchange loss
Foreign exchange loss should be determined in accordance with IFRS and Kazakhstan financial accounting legislation. The excess of foreign exchange loss over foreign exchange gain is allowed for deduction.
## Fines and penalties
Generally, deductions are available for forfeits, fines, and penalties that are not payable to the state budget.
## Taxes
Taxes remitted to the state budget of Kazakhstan are deductible within accrued amounts, except for the following:
  * Taxes excluded prior to calculation of aggregate annual income.
  * Income taxes paid in Kazakhstan and other countries.
  * Taxes paid in ‘black-listed’ jurisdictions.
  * EPT.
  * Alternative tax.


## Net operating losses
Net operating losses may be carried forward for up to ten years. Loss carryback is not permitted under the Kazakhstan tax legislation.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible for CIT purposes if the payments are intended to generate income, supported by documentation, and comply with the Kazakhstan transfer pricing law.


# Kazakhstan
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Kazakhstan tax law does not permit group taxation.
## Transfer pricing
Under the Kazakhstan transfer pricing law, tax authorities have the right to monitor and adjust prices used in cross-border and certain domestic transactions when prices are perceived to deviate from market prices, even if such transactions are with unrelated parties. If the authorities adjust prices, the re-assessed liability will include taxes, duties, penalty interest, and fines to the state budget.
Transfer pricing rules impact the following transactions:
  * International commercial transactions.
  * Domestic transactions that directly relate to international commercial operations where: 
    * the sale relates to a subsurface use contract
    * either party to the transaction has tax preferences, or
    * one of the parties has losses for two years preceding the year of the transaction.


### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
From 2018, the Transfer Pricing law introduces a 3-tiered approach to transfer pricing documentation for multinational enterprise (MNE) groups conducting business in Kazakhstan to file a CbC report retrospectively from January 2016, and a Master file and a Local file from January 2019, with the Kazakhstan tax authorities.
Kazakhstan entities of MNE groups are required to submit a notification about being a member of an MNE group not later than 1 September before the reporting financial year.
Non-compliance with the above requirements will lead to penalties.
## Thin capitalisation
Deduction of interest paid to related parties, to unrelated parties under related parties warranties, or to parties registered in countries with privileged taxation depends on the borrower's capital structure; deductible interest will be limited with reference to an 'acceptable' proportion of debt-to-equity (7:1 for financial institutions, 4:1 for all other entities). The list of jurisdictions with privileged taxation, the so called 'black list' established by the government, includes 56 jurisdictions.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
According to the Tax Code, a CFC is deemed to be an entity that meets both of the following conditions:
  * 25% or more of a non-resident’s shares belong directly, indirectly, or constructively to a Kazakhstan entity, or the entity is connected with the resident by means of control, and
  * the effective income tax rate of the non-resident is less than 10% or the non-resident is registered in a ‘black-listed’ jurisdiction (_see above_).


Recent amendments to the Tax Code introduced retrospective changes to the definition of a CFC, which now excludes companies registered in countries with an effective DTT with Kazakhstan if the nominal CIT rate in such country is more than 15%.
In addition, the new amendments introduced a _de minimis_ threshold (150,495 times MCI) for aggregate income of a CFC that should not be registered in a black-listed jurisdiction. This allows for the exemption of such company from Kazakhstan CFC rules.
The consolidated profit of the CFC (and PE of the CFC) should be included in the taxable income of the Kazakhstan entity and subject to CIT on the portion of undistributed profits from the non-resident company.
Amendments to the Tax Code also introduced exclusion of the company that bears financial loss indicated in its approved separate non-consolidated financial statement from the definition of CFC with retrospective effect starting from 1 January 2018.
In addition, the Tax Code provides for elimination of double taxation of the CFC’s financial profit (subject to certain criteria).


# Kazakhstan
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Net income of a non-resident legal entity’s PE, after CIT at 20%, is subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 15%, which may be reduced under an applicable double tax treaty (DTT). As such, the effective tax rate for income of a non-resident legal entity’s PE equals 32% if there is no reduction under a DTT.


# Kazakhstan
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
In general, the Kazakhstan Tax Code allows taxpayers to credit the foreign income taxes paid against the income taxes payable in Kazakhstan, provided the documents confirming the payment of such taxes are available. However, a tax credit may not be granted in certain cases (e.g. for taxes paid in countries with privileged taxation).
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives are available to certain Kazakhstan legal entities that fit certain criteria and possess objects (e.g. certain fixed assets) for which investment incentives may be applied. Generally, the investment incentives allow companies to fully deduct, for CIT purposes, the cost of the investment objects and the cost associated with their reconstruction and modernisation either at once or within the first three years of their use.
Based on the Entrepreneurial Code, incentives are granted under an investment contract between the government and companies with focus on priority sectors of the economy, as determined by the government. A qualifying investment project is granted with (i) exemption from customs duties and import VAT exemptions, with some limitations, and (ii) state in-kind grants. Priority investment projects, alongside the above-mentioned benefits, get (iii) tax incentives and (iv) investment subsidies. Special investment projects in the form of investment preferences are granted with (v) exemption from custom duties and (vi) tax incentives.
The amendments to the Tax Code introduced an 'investment tax credit' that allows changing tax payment deadlines for certain categories of taxpayers and also allows them to reduce tax payments by 100% or pay tax due in instalments, provided certain criteria of the taxpayer is met. The investment tax credit can be provided for a period of up to three years.
From 2022, a stable tax regime for ten years may be provided under a new investment incentive envisaged by the Entrepreneurial Code ('Agreement on investment obligations') in return for certain obligations to be fulfilled by a taxpayer. Guarantee of taxation regime stability is provided for VAT, WHT, payroll tax, excise taxes, and payments for emissions to the environment.
## Special economic zones (SEZs)
Currently, the following SEZs have been established in Kazakhstan:
  * 'Astana, the New City' in Nur-Sultan (the expiry date is in 2027).

The general incentives available for legal entities in SEZs are:
  * CIT: 100% reduction (subject to certain conditions).
  * VAT: 0% rate (for goods fully consumed during the performance of activities corresponding to purposes of creation of the SEZ and included in the list of goods established by the government of Kazakhstan).
  * Land tax and payment for the use of land plots: 0% rate.
  * Property tax: 0% rate.
  * Social tax: 100% reduction (subject to certain conditions for 'Park of Innovative Technologies').


The period of applying reduced amounts of taxes and (or) fees by 100% depends on the categories and their costs of projects established on special economic and industrial zones:
  * Category A - project cost up to 3,000,000 MCI (USD 6,700): For 7 years. 
  * Category B - project cost from 3,000,000 MCI (USD 6,700) to 14,500,000 MCI (USD 32,400): For 15 years.

# Kazakhstan
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Generally, Kazakhstan-sourced income of non-residents is subject to WHT at the rates shown in the table below.
## WHT on certain types of activities
Income of non-residents from provision of services in Kazakhstan is subject to WHT at 20%, including certain types of services (management, financial, consulting, engineering, marketing, auditing, and legal) that are deemed as Kazakhstan-sourced income disregarding the place of their actual performance.
## WHT on dividends
Effective from 1 January 2023, income of a non-resident in the form of dividends shall be taxable at the reduced rate of 10% if the following conditions are simultaneously met:
  * dividends are not paid to the entities registered in the ‘black-listed’ jurisdictions
  * the holding period of shares or participation interest is greater than three years (this should include the holding period by a previous holder if such shares/participation interest were received as a result of reorganisation of a previous holder)
  * the entity paying the dividends is not a subsurface user, and
  * 50% or more of the value of the entity paying the dividends is not derived from property of a subsurface user.


Herewith, dividend income of a non-resident paid by a subsurface user should qualify for 10% WHT (provided all the above conditions are met) if such subsurface user is engaged in further processing activities, under specific conditions.
It should be noted that the reduced 10% WHT rate applies only to dividends paid from net income that was previously subject to CIT, which is determined as the difference between the amount of taxable income and the amount of CIT calculated. 
Income previously subject to CIT is determined for each tax period for which dividends are distributed.
## WHT on capital gains
A non-resident legal entity is exempt from WHT on capital gains if the following are met simultaneously:
  * capital gains are not paid to the entities registered in the ‘black-listed’ jurisdictions
  * the holding period of shares or participation interest is greater than three years (this should include the holding period by a previous holder if such shares/participation interest were received as a result of reorganisation of a previous holder)
  * the entity from which the shares/participation interest are disposed is not a subsurface user, and
  * 50% or more of the value of the entity from which the shares/participation interest are disposed is not derived from property of a subsurface user.


Herewith, capital gains of a non-resident that directly or indirectly disposes of shares/participation interest of a Kazakhstan subsurface user should qualify for WHT exemption (provided all above conditions are met) if such subsurface user is engaged in further processing activities, under specific conditions.
Types of income at source of payment | WHT rate (%)  
---|---  
Dividends, capital gains, interest, royalties | 15  
Any income of a ‘black-listed’ entity | 20  
Insurance premiums under risk insurance agreements | 15  
Income from international transportation services; insurance premiums under risk reinsurance agreements | 5  
Other income | 20  
Benefits paid by a company to a shareholder, founder, participant, or related party, falling under the definition of constructive dividends, are taxed at a rate of 15%.
The rate of WHT may be reduced/non-resident's income may be exempted under an applicable DTT, provided that the following conditions are met simultaneously:
  * Existence of bilateral DTT ratified by both parties.
  * The non-resident does not create a PE in Kazakhstan.
  * The non-resident timely provides to a Kazakhstan tax agent the qualifying tax residency certificate (the Tax Code provides for additional document requirement in case the non-resident provides services in Kazakhstan). According to amendments to the Tax Code, duly formalised tax residency certificates can be provided in e-format provided all signatories and stamps are available on the corresponding website from 1 January 2019.
  * The non-resident is a beneficial owner of passive income (i.e. dividends, interest, or royalty) paid by a Kazakhstan tax agent.
  * In case of active income paid by the tax agent to a related non-resident, one of the following conditions is met: 
    * If the DTT between Kazakhstan and the relevant state of the non-resident is not affected by the MLI (_see below_), the non-resident is a beneficial owner of such income.
    * If the DTT between Kazakhstan and the relevant state is affected by the MLI, the non-resident's income is subject to inclusion into the non-resident's taxable base with no exemption/adjustment of taxable income or refund of tax paid from such income, and the relevant nominal tax rate in the state of the non-resident is not less than 15%.


Starting from 1 October 2020, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI) entered into force in Kazakhstan. This means that MLI provisions should affect covered DTTs, on which both contracting states deserved to extend the MLI. Kazakhstan expressed intention to extend some of the MLI provisions to all its DTTs conducted with the MLI member states. Certain DTTs are affected by MLI provisions from 1 January 2021.
One of the main MLI provision that may impact application of treaty relief to a non-resident's income is the principal purpose test, which denies treaty benefit if, notwithstanding any provisions of the DTT, it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the DTT.
Effective from 1 January 2023, if dividend, interest, and (or) royalties are paid to a related party who is a resident of a country with which the DTT has been amended by the MLI, the tax agent has the right to apply the DTT provisions if income is included in the taxable income of a non-resident recipient and is subject to tax at the nominal tax rate not less than 15%.
A list of bilateral DTTs concluded and ratified by Kazakhstan is shown below:
## WHT rates between Kazakhstan and treaty countries as of 1 January 2020

## Accounting system
Kazakhstan legal entities should maintain accounts and produce financial statements in accordance with IFRS or national accounting standards (depending on the size of the company and other factors). In most cases, tax treatment follows the accounting treatment.
## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
On 11 September 2017, Kazakhstan and the United States signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) under Model I to improve international tax compliance with respect to the US FATCA, which will enable the automatic exchange of financial information on each country's resident taxpayers to support tax enforcement efforts.
The IGA will be in force after the parties notify each other in writing that all necessary internal procedures have been completed.
As of March 2022, the President of Kazakhstan signed the law on ratification of the IGA.
## Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Strasbourg Convention)
Kazakhstan is a signatory of the Strasbourg Convention (ratified in December 2014) for administrative co-operation with other states in the assessment and collection of taxes with a view to combating tax avoidance and evasion.
Kazakhstan did not join multilateral competent authority agreements on automatic exchange of information under the Strasbourg Convention.
## The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project
Kazakhstan joined the Inclusive Framework on BEPS in January 2017. By joining the framework, Kazakhstan pledged to adopt and promote the implementation of the four minimum standards designed by the OECD in the BEPS project.
## Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI)
On 25 June 2018, Kazakhstan signed the MLI. The MLI, which was developed as a result of the BEPS plan, envisages introduction of a number of supplements and amendments to existing DTTs.
Kazakhstan expressed intention to extend some of the MLI provisions to all its DTTs conducted with the MLI member states.
The MLI entered into force in Kazakhstan starting from 1 October 2020.
## Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information
In June 2018, Kazakhstan signed the MCAA on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, which envisages implementation of the common reporting standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information (CRS).
The CRS will allow the Kazakhstan tax authorities to automatically obtain financial information, such as remaining balances of bank accounts maintained by Kazakhstan taxpayers, from other CRS member states. Kazakhstan intends to perform the first automatic exchange of information in September 2020.
On 1 December 2021, in the framework of CRS, Kazakhstan started receiving information on foreign assets and income of its residents from 69 members of the MCAA.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Kazakhstan legal entities are taxable on aggregate annual income earned worldwide. Non-resident legal entities, carrying out business activities through a PE in Kazakhstan, are taxable on income attributed to the activities of that PE. All taxpayers must apply the accrual method for recognition of income.
## Inventory valuation
For tax purposes, inventory is valued in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Kazakhstan financial accounting legislation. As such, permitted inventory valuation methods include first in first out (FIFO), weighted average, and specific identification methods.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to ordinary CIT rates. An exemption is available for capital gains realised from the sale of shares and participation interests in Kazakhstan for legal entities or consortiums that are not engaged in subsurface activities and are held for more than three years.
Capital gains from sale of shares/participation interest in subsurface users may be exempt from taxation in Kazakhstan if such subsurface users are engaged in further processing activities, under specific conditions.
Effective from 1 January 2023, Kazakhstan individuals paying capital gain to non-residents could also be considered as tax agents for withholding tax (WHT) purposes.
## Dividend income
Dividend income of a Kazakhstan resident company on inbound dividends is exempt from Kazakhstan taxation. Dividends from a Kazakhstan resident company to another Kazakhstan resident company are exempt from taxation, except for dividends paid by certain types of taxpayers.
Effective from 1 January 2023, dividends paid on securities that, on the date of dividends’ accrual, are included in the official list of the stock exchange of the Republic of Kazakhstan should not be subject to exclusion from the taxable income, unless there is an active bidding process. The criteria for an active bidding process are as follows:
  * The value of transactions with these securities should be at least KZT 25 million per calendar month. Only executed transactions with securities are taken in account.
  * The number of transactions with these securities should be at least 50 transactions per calendar month.


The stock exchange of the Republic of Kazakhstan ('KASE', 'AIFC') should report on the Internet sources of information about securities that meet the established criteria no later than the 15th day of the month following the reporting quarter.
## Interest income
Interest income should be included in the aggregate annual income of a taxpayer and taxed at the 20% CIT rate.
## Royalty income
Royalty income should be included in the aggregate annual income of a taxpayer and taxed at the 20% CIT rate.

# Kazakhstan
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
The tax rate for corporations is 20% and is assessed for a calendar year. All Kazakhstan legal entities and branches of foreign legal entities are subject to corporate income tax (CIT). Taxable income is determined as the taxpayer's aggregate annual income less allowable deductions.
Resident companies are taxable in Kazakhstan on their worldwide profits, while non-resident companies operating through a permanent establishment (PE) in Kazakhstan are subject to Kazakhstan CIT only on the profits attributable to that PE.
Non-residents without a PE in Kazakhstan that receive income from sources in Kazakhstan are generally subject to income tax withheld at source of payment on Kazakhstan-sourced income (_please see the section for more information_).
## Reduced CIT rates
A reduced CIT rate of 6% applies to the qualified agricultural income of legal entities producing agricultural products.
In addition, taxpayers operating in special economic zones (SEZs) may enjoy full exemption from CIT if certain statutory requirements established for such benefits are met (_see the section for more information_).
## Excess profit tax (EPT)
EPT rates are progressive and range from 10% to 60%. The tax base is comprised of the portion of net income of subsurface users exceeding 25% of deductions for EPT purposes. Subsurface users may include to immediate deductions for EPT purposes (with certain limitations) asset acquisition costs, capital costs, and costs incurred by subsurface users in earlier periods, which were not previously deducted.
Starting from 2018, EPT is abolished for subsurface users engaging in extraction of solid minerals. At that, corresponding subsurface use contracts should not envisage extraction of other groups of mineral resources.
In addition, the Tax Code introduced an alternative tax that can substitute for several types of taxes for subsurface users (_see below_).
## Alternative tax
The new Tax Code introduced an alternative tax that replaces EPT, mineral extraction tax (MET), and compensation of historical costs and may be applied at the discretion of a taxpayer.
The alternative tax is applicable to subsurface use contracts on production and/or combined exploration and production of oil and gas products, the place of which should be:
  * fully located in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea, or
  * at deeply folded oilfields locating not higher than 4,500 metres and with lowest point of bedding at 5,000 metres or lower.


Generally, the calculation of the tax base, the tax period, and the deadlines are similar to the existing CIT framework, except for some specifics (e.g. foreign exchange impact should be disregarded, interest expenses are not allowed for deduction). The tax rate is progressive (from 0% to 42%) and depends on the world price fluctuations of crude oil.
In addition, the taxpayers applying an alternative tax can be exempt from payment of rent tax on export of crude oil.
## Local income taxes
There are no regional or local income taxes in Kazakhstan.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
The current VAT rate is 12%. This tax is applicable to the sales value of goods, works, and services, as well as to imports. Exports of goods and international transportation services are taxed at 0% VAT. There is a list of goods, works, and services exempt from VAT (e.g. sales of medicines, financial services provided by financial institutions, financial leasing services, notary and advocacy services, operations with financial securities and investment gold, loan transactions).
All VAT payers should issue VAT invoices in electronic format (‘e-invoices’). 
VAT payers issuing e-invoices who are involved in sales of certain types of goods (specifically listed in the order of the Ministry of Finance) should register these goods within the virtual warehouse (VW) module. If such goods are not in the VW module, their sale is impossible, as the e-invoicing information system prevents a taxpayer from issuing an e-invoice for goods that are not recognised in the VW module.
A new clause in the Tax Code from 2022 introduces the notion of 'traceability of the turnover of goods imported into the customs territory of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU or EEU)'. The national traceability system would be the electronic invoice information system. E-invoice is an accompanying document of the national tracing system. The tax authorities should ensure provision of data on goods subject to tracing and associated turnover transactions contained in the E-Invoicing System to the respective EAEU states.
Since 2022, issuance of e-invoices is not required upon sale of (i) goods from the list of exclusions, (ii) imported goods, and (iii) goods of non-VAT payers reflected in a VW module if such goods are sold to:
  * individuals using purchased goods for own, family, home, or any other purposes not related to business operations, or
  * individuals or legal entities being subjects of micro-entrepreneurship.


In addition, Kazakhstan launched a pilot project for issuance of e-waybills on importation, shipment, and export of goods from Kazakhstan. A different timeline of the pilot project is envisaged for different categories of goods.
From 2022, minimum prices apply to certain goods imported to Kazakhstan from the Eurasian Economic Union for determination of VATable import. Currently, the list includes only certain types of spirits and alcohol, but the list could potentially be amended in future.
From 2022, VAT on electronic sale of services and goods is introduced (the so-called 'Google Tax'). The tax will be assessed and paid by foreign companies rendering services to Kazakhstan individuals in electronic format or by foreign companies owning Internet platforms through which Kazakhstan individuals purchase goods.
The payer of the VAT shall calculate the Google tax if one of the following conditions is met:
  * The place of residence of the individual buyer is the Republic of Kazakhstan.
  * The location of the bank in which the bank account is opened, used by the individual buyer to pay for services, or the electronic money operator through which the individual buyer pays for services is the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
  * The network address of the individual buyer used in the purchase of services is registered in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
  * The international country code of the telephone number (including mobile) used to purchase or pay for services is assigned by the Republic of Kazakhstan.


Issuance of invoices by the payer of Google tax is not required. A foreign company is required to pay the calculated Google tax for each quarter no later than the 25th day of the second month following the quarter in which the sale of goods and services was carried out.
The obligatory VAT registration threshold in 2024 is set at 20,000 times the Monthly Calculation Index (MCI). For individual entrepreneurs using special tax regimes, the VAT threshold is set at 124,184 times the MCI.
The VAT reporting period is a calendar quarter.
## Customs duties
The Kazakhstan Customs Code and the Customs Code of the Eurasian Economic Union implemented a number of progressive provisions intended for simplification of customs procedures, integration of information technology (IT) initiatives, and reduction of ‘red tape’ issues in customs control procedures from January 2018.
In April 2018, full-scale electronic declaration was launched for all customs procedures through Information System ‘Astana - 1’.
The Customs Code of the Eurasian Economic Union conceptually changed the definition of a ‘customs declarant’, which may significantly impact business models of supply chains and logistics.
Finally, the new provisions allow an entity that is qualified as an ‘authorised economic operator’ to apply simplified customs procedures.
Kazakhstan is a World Trade Organization (WTO) member.
Customs duties apply to goods imported to the Customs Union countries from third countries. Customs duties rates are established either based on a percentage (in general, ranging between 0% and 40%; higher rates exist for certain goods) of the customs value of goods or in absolute terms in euros (EUR) or US dollars (USD).
Goods of the Customs Union countries should be generally exempt from Kazakhstan customs duties.
In addition to membership in the Customs Union, Kazakhstan concluded a number of bilateral and multilateral Free Trade Agreements with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which provide for exemption of goods circulated between the CIS member states from customs duties, provided certain conditions are met.
The ATA Carnet temporary import system is launched in Kazakhstan. This system allows the duty-free temporary import and export of goods for specific purposes.
### Customs fees
A customs processing fee is assessed at 20,000 Kazakhstan tenge (KZT) for full customs declaration.
According to Order #1024, dated 19 October 2020, “On rules and terms of implementation of pilot project on administration of taxpayers importing goods into the EAEU customs territory with the application of a risk management system”, the Kazakhstan tax (customs) authorities conducted a pilot project on goods imported to the Eurasian Economic Union starting from 3 November 2020. 
Under the pilot project, the authorities carry out desk-top audits via an automated comparison and analysis of data indicated in tax and customs returns filed by the taxpayer. If this results in a high score under the risk management system, a notification on deemed tax violations may be issued to the taxpayer. Failure to respond to the notification in time may result in the taxpayer’s bank accounts being blocked by the tax authorities. 
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes apply to the sale and import of crude oil, gas condensate, petrol/gasoline (excluding aviation fuel), diesel fuel, spirits and alcoholic beverages, beer, tobacco, and passenger cars.
Type of excisable good | Excise tax rate  
---|---  
Crude oil, gas condensate, petrol/gasoline, diesel | KZT 0 to KZT 24,935 per tonne  
Alcoholic beverages and beer, tobacco | KZT 0 to KZT 15,900 per item of measure (kilos, litres, or units)  
Passenger cars | KZT 100 per each cm³ of engine capacity  
## Property tax
Property tax is assessed annually at a general rate of 1.5% of the average net book value of immovable property.
Property tax objects include buildings and constructions in actual use, even if not registered with the justice authorities.
## Land tax
Entities and individuals that own land plots (or land share in cases of commonly shared ownership of land plots) must pay land tax annually. Land tax rates vary based on the purpose for which the land is used, as well as the size and quality of the land.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Kazakhstan.
## Stamp taxes
There are no stamp taxes in Kazakhstan.
## Social tax
Employers must pay social tax at the rate of 9.5% of gross remuneration (salaries and certain benefits provided) of all employees (local and expatriate). The minimum limit for calculating social tax is 14 times the MCI * 9.5% (approximately USD 10).
## Obligatory social insurance contributions
Obligatory social insurance contributions are payable by employers at the rate of 3.5% to the State Pension Centre of Pension Payments. Obligatory social insurance contributions are capped at 3.5% of seven times the minimum monthly wage (MMW) at maximum limit (approximately USD 45). The minimum limit is at 1% of MMW * 3.5% (approximately USD 6) per month and are deductible from social tax. Only Kazakhstan citizens, foreigners holding a residence permit in Kazakhstan, and citizens of member countries (i.e. Russia, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan) of the Eurasian Economic Union, who have a local employment agreement, are subject to obligatory social insurance.
## Obligatory pension contributions (OPC)
OPC are withheld at a rate of 10% out of employees’ gross income and paid to the State Pension Centre of Pension Payments. The gross income subject to OPC is capped at 50 times the MMW (approximately USD 9,239) per employee per month. Only Kazakhstan citizens, foreigners holding a residence permit in Kazakhstan, and citizens of member countries (i.e. Russia, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan) of the Eurasian Economic Union, who have a local employment agreement, are subject to OPC.
In addition, individuals who are working under a service agreement (providing services on a Civil Contract basis) should not make OPC to the State Pension Centre in their own favour. Starting from 2019, OPC for these individuals should be done by a tax agent (company with which the contract is concluded).
### Obligatory Employer Pension Contributions (OEPC)
Starting from 1 January 2024, the employer shall pay OEPC at the rate of 1.5%. Income accepted for calculating the OEPC includes all types of wages in monetary terms and other income. At the same time, the monthly income accepted for calculating the OEPC must be no less than the MMW and must not exceed 50 times the MMW established for the corresponding financial year by the law on the republican budget. Exempt from paying OEPC are individuals who have reached retirement age, individuals with disabilities of the first and second groups, military personnel, employees of special government and law enforcement agencies, and individuals over 48 years of age.
### Obligatory Professional Pension Contributions (OPPC)
The employer is required to allocate 5% of one's own resources as OPPC to the employees engaged in jobs with harmful (especially harmful) work conditions. The list of positions subject to OPPC is published by the authorised state authority. Income accepted for calculating the OPPC includes all types of wages in monetary terms and other income. At the same time, the monthly income accepted for calculating the OPPC must be no less than the MMW and must not exceed 50 times the MMW established for the corresponding financial year by the law on the republican budget.
## Obligatory social medical insurance contributions (OMIC)
Starting from 1 January 2022, employer’s OMIC are increased to the rate of 3%. For 2024, the rate is the same 3%. All employers, including branches and representative offices, should pay OMIC for all their employees, including Kazakhstan citizens and foreigners holding Kazakhstan residence permit, or citizens of member countries of the Eurasian Economic Union. The monthly income accepted for calculating OMIC should not exceed ten times the MMW (in 2024, the calculation of income is not more than KZT 850,000). 
Starting from 1 January 2021, for 2022, 2023, and 2024, employee OMIC are withheld at a rate of 2% out of employees' gross income and paid to the Social Health Insurance Fund. The gross income subject to employee OMIC is capped at ten times the MMW per employee per month. Subject to employee OMIC are Kazakhstan citizens, foreigners holding Kazakhstan residence permit, and citizens of member countries of the Eurasian Economic Union.
## Vehicle tax
Vehicle tax rates are based on MCI and determined in accordance with the type of vehicle, engine volume, operation period of vehicles (aircraft only), and other factors.
## Mineral extraction tax (MET)
MET applies to the monetary value of extracted volume of crude oil, gas condensate, natural gas, minerals, and groundwater.
MET is calculated based on the value of the extracted content, which is computed by applying average global prices to the extracted volume (adjusted for content). The determination of average global prices is based on the list of publications that are considered as official sources for computation of MET (Platts Crude Oil Marketwire and Crude Argus).
Currently, MET rates for crude oil and gas condensate range from 5% to 18%, depending on the accumulated production volume for the calendar year. For hydrocarbons, rates can be reduced by 50% if they are supplied to domestic refineries on the basis of a sale/purchase agreement or tolling agreement.
The MET rate for natural gas is set at 10%. For domestic sales of natural gas, MET rates range from 0.5% to 1.5%.
MET rates for minerals that have undergone initial processing (except for widespread minerals) and for coal vary between 0% and 21.06%.
The amendments to the Tax Code introduced a maximum MET rate of 1 MCI per cubic metre under certain conditions, as well as other reduced rates for specific cases, which simplifies the administrative procedure of tax liability calculation, with retrospective effect starting from 1 January 2018.
The application of MET rates effective as of 31 December 2022 is possible if the field of solid minerals is classified as low profit (5% or less).
The criteria for providing incentives for exemption from MET for new fields with a link to the level of the internal profitability rate were introduced.
## The tax on digital mining
Starting from 2022, entities engaged in digital mining (i.e. mining of cryptocurrencies) are required to pay the digital mining tax, which is charged for the amount of electrical energy consumed during the mining process.
The tax rate is set at KZT 2 per kilowatt-hour of electrical energy consumed depending on the amount of electricity consumed. The tax period is a calendar quarter. The tax is payable not later than the 20th day of the month following the reporting quarter.
The persons engaged in digital mining have the obligation to submit a declaration of payment for digital mining (form 880.00), which is carried out to the body of state income at the location of the taxpayer. Submission deadline is quarterly, no later than the 15th day of the second month following the reporting quarter.
The tax is payable not later than the 25th day of the second month following the reporting quarter.
