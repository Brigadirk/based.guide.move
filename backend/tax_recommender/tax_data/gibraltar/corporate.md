Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Budget 2024
In July 2024, the Chief Minister and the Minister for Taxation delivered their budget speeches, which included the below announcements.
### Corporate income tax (CIT)
The rate of corporate taxation will increase from 12.5% to 15% with effect from 1 July 2024. 
### Import duty
The following measures relating to import duty were announced:
  * Mild hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs) will pay import duty at the rate of 10% (previously 0%).
  * Full hybrids and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) will pay import duty at the rate of 5% (previously 0%).
  * Pleasure crafts will pay import duty at the rate of 5% (previously 0%). The cap will be fixed at 35,000 British pounds (GBP) as it is for vehicles.
  * The above duty increases will not apply to importations where the vehicle/vessel was ordered before 30 September this year, even if delivered after.


### Stamp duty 
It was confirmed that the special stamp duty introduced previously in respect of sales of government affordable homes will not apply to sales after an acquisition of an affordable home on the open market.
New purchase agreements and assignments of off-plan purchases will be registrable instruments with a 0.5% special stamp duty payable on Assignment of Purchase Agreement (by the assignor). This will not include sales on subsidised estates.
### Restriction on brought-forward trading losses
The government will introduce legislation to restrict the use of accumulated tax losses for companies within the financial services and gaming sectors. The measure seeks to limit the brought-forward trading losses for each accounting period but will not seek to eliminate them. The measure will take effect as from 1 July 2024.
### Taxation on the profits or gains derived from property sales 
The Minister for Taxation announced a new tax measure under which any entity or person who holds an interest in three or more residential properties over five consecutive years will be subject to tax on the gain upon disposal of any of the properties. Specified properties are exempt from this measure, including properties used as the primary residence of the beneficial owners and in an estate of a deceased person. 
Anti-avoidance provisions will be implemented where any individuals undertaking professional conveyancing activities on behalf of another will have a reporting obligation to notify the Income Tax Office. 
### Increase in audit threshold
Jointly with the Minister for Taxation, the Minister for Business announced that the audit threshold for companies will increase from GBP 1.5 million to GBP 1.75 million, applicable to accounting periods that end on or after 1 July 2024.
## Extension of taxation of interest as a trading receipt to insurers and distributed ledger technology (DLT) firms
In February 2024, the Minister of Taxation announced an extension of taxation on interest income as a trading receipt to include insurance companies and DLT firms.
The amendment to the Income Tax Act 2010 specifies interest or ’similar amounts‘ and lists these as to include financial instruments that pay a recurring amount of income, income from virtual assets, discounts, or any other arrangement that has a purpose, or one of the main purposes, to avoid tax under paragraph 15 of the Act.
Anti-avoidance provisions prevent an individual from purposely disposing of the interest-generating asset or instrument to a connected person where the interest income would be outside the scope of taxation under paragraph 15 of the Act. Where it is found that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is the avoidance of taxation, the individual disposing of the asset or instrument will be assessable to taxation as if the disposal had not occurred.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the accounting period of the company, which begins on the later of the beginning of the accounting period and the date when the company first receives a source of taxable income and ends on the earlier of the end of the accounting period, 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period, or the date on which trade ceased.
## Tax returns
Companies with income subject to tax in Gibraltar are required to file a return and calculate their tax liability for the year. The return, together with the estimated liability, needs to be accompanied by payment of the tax due nine months after the date of the company's financial year end.
Companies with assessable income of more than GBP 1.75 million are required to file audited accounts together with the tax return.
Where companies have assessable income of less than GBP 1.75 million, the accounts can be accompanied by an Independent Accountant's Report.
Companies with no assessable income are still required to file tax returns. The accounts to be filed depend on the size of the company as determined by the CA 2014. Full audited accounts are required except where the company qualifies as 'small', which would mean satisfying two of the following criteria for two consecutive years:
  * Net turnover of less than GBP 10.2 million.
  * Total assets of less than GBP 5.1 million.
  * Average employees of less than 50.


Where the company is 'small' and has no assessable income, only an abridged balance sheet needs to be filed.
## Payment of tax
Companies are required to make payments on account of future liabilities on 28 February and 30 September in each calendar year. Each payment should be equal to 50% of the tax payable for the relevant accounting period. The relevant accounting period is a prior accounting period whose tax payable date (i.e. nine months after the date of the company’s financial year end) precedes the first payment on account date for the accounting period in question. The relevant table in Schedule 10 of the Income Tax Act can be used to determine the correct relevant accounting period for the purposes of calculating the payments on account.
The balance of tax due (i.e. the actual liability less payments on account) is payable on the date of filing of the return.
### Penalties and fines
The following penalties and fines are applicable:
  * For the late payment of tax, there is a penalty of 10% of the amount of tax due on the day immediately after such payment was due. A further amount penalty based on 20% of the tax due (including any unpaid surcharge) may be imposed if the tax remains unpaid after 90 days.
  * Failure to file a return by the due date will result in a penalty of GBP 50 with a further penalty of GBP 300 / GBP 500 if the return is not submitted within three months / six months, respectively, after the due date.The following increased late filing penalties based on the size of companies as defined in the Companies Act 2014 will apply as of 1 July 2023 (subject to the relevant legislation being enacted):  Company size | After due date | 3 months after due date | 6 months after due date  
---|---|---|---  
Micro / Small | GBP 100 | GBP 450 | GBP 750  
Medium | GBP 750 | GBP 1,250 | GBP 2,000  
Large | GBP 1,500 | GBP 3,500 | GBP 5,000  
  * Failure to respond to a notice or request to submit information or documentation will result in a fine of GBP 200 on the day the failure occurs and a further penalty of GBP 1,000 if the failure to comply continues one month after the applicable day for delivery of the accounts as referred to in the notice. Failure to comply beyond a three-month period, if convicted, can result in imprisonment.
  * For fraudulently, recklessly, or negligently delivering to the Commissioner an incorrect return, accounts, or information, there is a fine of up to 150% of the difference between the actual tax due and the tax due as per the original declaration. The amount of the penalty will depend on: 
    * the amount of the tax lost and/or delayed
    * the gravity of the offence (i.e. if deliberate or an honest mistake), and
    * the level of cooperation in the investigation.
  * The Commissioner of Income Tax may publish details of a person who has failed to pay tax due under the Income Tax Act or under the PAYE regulations in the Gibraltar Gazette if: 
    * the Commissioner has notified the person of the Commissioner’s intention to do so 30 days prior to the publication
    * the person has failed to pay tax due to an amount of GBP 5,000, and
    * the tax due to be collected or paid has not been collected or paid for a period of at least three months after the due date.
  * Failure to notify the Commissioner of an arrangement, the main benefit of which is to avoid the payment of tax, will result in a fine of GBP 200 on the day the failure occurs and a further penalty of GBP 1,000 if the failure to comply continues one month after the applicable day for providing the information.


### Administrative fees
The Income Tax Office charges administrative fees for the provision of information requests, including ordinarily resident certificates, subcontractor certificates, payment transaction print-outs, and copies of previous fillings and associated documentation.
## Tax audit process
The Gibraltar tax system is based on self-assessment. However, the Income Tax Office has powers to make an enquiry into the tax return of a company within a period of 12 months from the date when the return is due to be filed or, if filed later than the deadline, 12 months from the date it was filed. If the Commissioner of Income Tax believes a return to be fraudulent, the above time limits will not apply.
A taxpayer may appeal against a disputed assessment by notice in writing addressed to the Commissioner within 28 days of the date of service of the notice of the assessment.
## Statute of limitations
The Commissioner has up to six years following the date of assessment to revise any incorrect assessments. There is no limit where the incorrect assessment is as a result of fraud, wilful default, or neglect.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Transfer pricing has become a priority area for the Gibraltar Tax Authorities. They have added to their resources and are undergoing a process of upskilling in this area. 


# Gibraltar
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
A company will be considered resident in Gibraltar if the management and control of its business is exercised from Gibraltar or from outside Gibraltar by persons who are ordinarily tax resident in Gibraltar.
The location of central management and control will be established under legal principles laid down in the United Kingdom (UK) and is the place of the highest form of control and direction over a company's affairs, as opposed to decisions on the day-to-day running of the business.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Gibraltar Tax Commissioner accepts the definition of PE set out in Article 5 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Convention.
Under the Gibraltar Companies Act 2014 (CA 2014), foreign companies that establish a place of business in Gibraltar or have a branch in Gibraltar must register with the Registrar within one month of commencing business in Gibraltar. Under the CA 2014, the definition of a company includes a foreign company registered in Gibraltar. The profits or gains of a foreign company registered in Gibraltar shall be assessable on the accounting period beginning whenever that company is first registered in Gibraltar.


# Gibraltar
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
For the purpose of ascertaining assessable income, all expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of income shall be deducted.
## Capital allowances
The first GBP 30,000 of qualifying expenditure on plant and machinery (including fixtures and fittings) and the first GBP 50,000 of qualifying expenditure on computer equipment is fully deductible in the first year as a 'first year allowance'.
Thereafter, qualifying assets are pooled and are subject to an annual capital, or wear and tear, allowance. Allowances are available for plant and machinery (including fixtures and fittings), computer equipment, and motor vehicles at the rate of 15% (20% for companies that are obligated to pay the higher CIT rate, _see the_ section) and are calculated on a reducing-balance basis.
For accounting periods (or years of assessment as the case may be) ending in the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2023, the capital allowances deduction will be based on the higher of:
  * the first GBP 60,000 of qualifying expenditure in relation to plant and machinery and the first GBP 100,000 of qualifying expenditure on computer equipment, and
  * 50% of the qualifying expenditure incurred,


with the balance deductible at the rate of 25% _per annum_ (30% for companies that are obligated to pay the higher CIT rate) on a reducing balance basis.
Capital allowances for industrial buildings are deductible at the rate of 4% _per annum_ on a straight-line basis.
For accounting periods (or years of assessment as the case may be) ending in the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2023, a 1% general wear and tear allowance is available based on the cost of acquiring real property from where a business is conducted (excluding industrial buildings).
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not a deductible expense.
## Start-up expenses
Expenditure incurred with a view to carrying on a trade is treated as incurred on the first day on which the trade is carried on for the purposes of computing the profits or gains of the trade.
## Interest expenses
Full deduction is available in respect of interest expenses, subject to anti-avoidance rules (_see the section for more information_).
## Bad debt
Only specific bad debts or specific bad debt provisions are deductible to the extent that they are respectively estimated to be bad during the said period, notwithstanding that such bad debts were payable prior to the commencement of the period. General doubtful debt provisions are not an allowable expense.
## Charitable contributions
A charitable donation is not considered as having been wholly and exclusively expended for the purposes of the production of the income of the trade and is therefore not allowable as a deduction for tax purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties, including those resulting from late payment of taxation or from failure to make the necessary tax submissions, are deemed to be a tax and are therefore not a deductible expense.
## Taxes
No deduction is allowed for any tax charges under the Income Tax Act.
## Other significant items
Additionally, no deduction is allowed in respect of the following:
  * Domestic or private expenses.
  * Expenses not incurred wholly and exclusively in the generation of income.
  * Any expenses of a capital nature.
  * Any sum recoverable under an insurance contract or contract of indemnity.
  * Property expenses not incurred for the purposes of producing income.
  * Depreciation of assets (although capital allowances are available, _see above_).
  * Employee remuneration not accompanied by a certified statement of name, address, and amount of remuneration (in respect of Gibraltar employment only).
  * Certain business entertainment expenditure falling within guidelines published by the Commissioner.
  * Interest paid to a non-Gibraltar resident that is more than a reasonable commercial rate.


In the case of a company that has income, some of which is chargeable to tax and some of which is not, the deductions allowed shall be apportioned on a pro-rata basis between the chargeable and non-chargeable income.
## Net operating losses
A trading loss incurred in an accounting period may be offset against trading income, if any, arising in the same period or subsequent periods.
If, however, within any period of three years there is both a change in ownership and a major change in the nature and conduct of a trade, trading losses may not be offset against trading income arising in the same or subsequent periods.
In July 2024, the government announced a proposed restriction on accumulated trading losses for companies in the financial services and gaming sector. Legislation has yet to be published. 
In 2018, the government also announced the introduction of legislation allowing the transfer of losses between group entities upon restructuring, provided that there is no change to the ultimate ownership or a change of business within a period of three years. The changes allow losses to be carried forward against a business even if the business is transferred to another company under the same ultimate ownership. A bill was published on 12 November 2020 to introduce this change and once passed it will be deemed to have come into operation on 1 July 2018. To date, this has not been passed, however, the Gibraltar tax authorities are applying the contents of the Bill administratively.
Anti-abuse provisions restrict the transfer of losses to instances of legitimate group restructuring. The transfer of accumulated losses from one type of business to another is specifically prohibited.
Any losses not connected with or arising from the trade, business, profession, or vocation are not allowable deductions.
There is no provision for the carrying back of losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
In the case of branches, the amount of general head office expenses incurred that is deductible is limited to 5% of its turnover.
The Income Tax Act includes anti-avoidance provisions. These provisions state that if the amount charged for goods or services by a connected person is not at arm's length, then the expenses that are allowed are subject to the lower of:
  * the expense
  * 5% of the gross turnover of the company, or
  * 75% of the pre-expense net profit of the company.




# Gibraltar
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Companies are assessed on an individual basis, and trading losses of group members may not be offset against profits of other members of the group.
However, a Bill was introduced in 2020 that, when enacted, will allow the transfer of losses between group entities upon restructuring, provided that there is no change to the ultimate ownership or a change of business within a period of three years. The changes allow losses to be carried forward against a business even if the business is transferred to another company under the same ultimate ownership. Anti-abuse provisions restrict the transfer of losses to instances of legitimate group restructuring. The transfer of accumulated losses from one type of business to another is specifically prohibited.
The Income Tax Act contains a generic anti-avoidance clause that allows the Commissioner to disregard an arrangement that the Commissioner believes is fictitious or artificial. In addition, it includes the following specific anti-avoidance measures.
Where a taxpayer seeks to reduce their liability to tax by creating an artificial split between activities in Gibraltar and outside of Gibraltar, the Commissioner shall use anti-avoidance provisions to defeat such an attempt.
## Transfer pricing
The general anti-avoidance rule in the Income Tax Act should be interpreted in such manner as best secures consistency with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations and other documents designated as comprising part of the transfer pricing guidelines.
There is also a specific rule in relation to interest payments. The amount of interest payments to connected persons that are in excess of that payable at arm’s length will be deemed to be a dividend. Where the amount charged for goods and services by connected persons is not at arm’s length, this will be disallowed as a taxable expense. Any expenses allowed will be subject to the lesser of (i) the expense, (ii) 5% of the gross turnover of the company, and (iii) 75% of the pre-expense profit of the company.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Under the CbC reporting regime, a Gibraltar tax resident company that is the ultimate parent entity or surrogate parent of a multinational enterprise group with consolidated revenue of at least 750 million euros (EUR) is required, for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2016, to file, within 12 months of the end of the fiscal year, a CbC report containing information on its group entities and jurisdictions in which the group operates.
A Gibraltar constituent entity of a multinational enterprise group with consolidated revenue of at least EUR 750 million is required in cases where it is not obligated to file a CbC report to notify the Gibraltar tax authorities of the identity and jurisdiction of tax residence of the entity in the group that is required to report.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest paid on a loan to related parties that are not companies (or loans where security is provided by related parties) where the ratio of the value of the loan capital to the equity of the company exceeds 5:1 will be considered as dividend payments and thus not deductible for tax purposes. This provision is not applicable to Gibraltar banks or money lenders.
## Interest limitation rule
The interest limitation rule provides that exceeding interest expenses are deductible up to the greater of (i) 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) and (ii) EUR 3 million.
## Back-to-back loans
Since interest income is not taxable on back-to-back loans, the interest expense is not deductible.
## Dual employment
Income from dual employment contracts is taxed in Gibraltar if both employers are connected persons.
## Transfer of assets abroad
Where assets are transferred abroad with the purpose of avoiding tax and the taxpayer has the power to enjoy these assets either now or in the future, then any income or benefits received from these assets will be deemed to be income chargeable to tax.
## Controlled foreign company (CFC) rule
The CFC rule attributes to a Gibraltar company the undistributed profits of a CFC (i.e. Gibraltar entity has at least 50% of either the voting rights or the capital or is entitled to receive 50% of the profits and the actual tax paid is less than 50% of the tax that would have been paid in Gibraltar on the same income) from non-genuine arrangements where the purposes is to gain a tax advantage.
## Hybrid mismatch 
A hybrid mismatch that results in a double deduction for tax purposes:
  * shall be denied in the investor jurisdiction, and
  * where the deduction is not denied in the investor jurisdiction, it shall be denied in the payer jurisdiction.


A hybrid mismatch that results in a tax deduction without inclusion:
  * shall be denied in the payer jurisdiction, and
  * where the deduction is not denied in the payer jurisdiction, it shall be included in income (for tax purposes) in the payee jurisdiction.


Except where one of the jurisdictions involved in the transaction(s) has made an equivalent adjustment in respect of the hybrid mismatch, a deduction for tax purposes shall be denied for payments that directly or indirectly fund expenditure that gives rise to a hybrid mismatch.
Where a hybrid mismatch results in disregarded PE income, the taxpayer must include the income that would otherwise be attributed to the disregarded PE. This does not apply to income exempted under a double taxation treaty (DTT).
Where a hybrid financial instrument results in withholding tax (WHT) relief to more than one party, the benefit of such relief is limited in proportion to the net taxable income of the payment.
A 'hybrid mismatch' includes any of the following:
  * A payment under a financial instrument that gives rise to a tax deduction without inclusion.
  * A payment to a hybrid entity that gives rise to a deduction without inclusion.
  * A payment to an entity with one or more PEs that gives rise to a deduction without inclusion.
  * A payment that gives rise to a deduction without inclusion as a result of a payment to a disregarded PE.
  * A payment by a hybrid entity that gives rise to a deduction without inclusion as a result of the payment being disregarded.
  * A deemed payment between two PEs that gives rise to a deduction without inclusion as a result of the payment being disregarded or where a double deduction outcome occurs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
The basis for taxation of branches of foreign enterprises is the same as for corporations.
Allowable head office charges or expenses incurred by a Gibraltar branch for the common purpose of the company and its branches, or for the purpose of the head office or another branch exclusively, are limited to 5% of turnover of the Gibraltar branch (_see Payments to foreign affiliates in the section_).

Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Relief is available in Gibraltar in respect of foreign tax paid. This applies to any person who has paid or is liable to pay tax under the Income Tax Act in respect of profits or gains derived from sources within Gibraltar or within any other jurisdiction who can prove to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Income Tax that one has paid or is liable to pay income tax in the other jurisdiction in respect of the same profits or gains.

## Small business and start-up incentives
All newly established businesses in Gibraltar are able to claim 100% of their eligible capital allowances in the first year of trade.
Businesses with ten employees or less will receive a credit of GBP 100 per employee in respect of social insurance contributions. For new businesses in the first year of operation, the credit is extended to 20 employees.
A tax credit equal to the lower of 200% or GBP 5,000 of architectural fees and fees charged by the government in respect of successful planning applications is available in the first three years of operation.

  * It must be a new business set-up in Gibraltar and not the transfer of a business already existing in Gibraltar.
  * The business must employ at least five people.
  * The business must be a company or limited partnership but not an individual trading in its own name.
  * The tax credit does not carry forward from one year to the next. Consequently, if the company does not make a profit and is not able to use the credit, it will be lost.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
## Mandatory disclosure regime (DAC6)
Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements was introduced into Gibraltar law on 30 January 2020 and imposes an obligation on tax consultants, banks, lawyers, and other intermediaries to disclose any cross-border arrangement that contains one or more features or 'hallmarks' if they are identified as intermediaries for the purposes of the Directive.
### Scope
On 21 January 2021, the Gibraltar Competent Authority for the exchange of information for tax purposes announced that Gibraltar is limiting the scope of reporting under DAC6. Following the approach adopted in the United Kingdom, reporting in Gibraltar will be limited to cross-border arrangements falling within Category D Hallmarks (CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures). The Income Tax Act 2010 has been amended to reflect this change. However, note that the International Agreements on Taxation Matters (Spain) Regulations 2021 have introduced equivalent reporting requirements to DAC6 in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements involving Gibraltar and Spain.
'Arrangements', which are defined broadly to include an agreement, scheme, plan, transaction, etc. or series thereof, can involve several parts or stages of implementation or execution.
There is no requirement to report on purely domestic arrangements, and VAT, customs, and excise duties are also outside the scope of the new reporting regime.
### Hallmarks
The DAC6 reporting obligations focus on cross-border tax planning arrangements that meet certain hallmarks intended to highlight potential risk of tax avoidance. The reporting obligation only arises if one or more of these hallmarks is triggered.
The hallmarks introduced by the Regulations follow those contained in the Directive. No additional hallmarks are introduced. 
In line with the Directive, certain hallmarks trigger reporting obligations only where obtaining of a tax advantage is the main benefit or one of the main benefits of the arrangement. However, other hallmarks trigger reporting in all cases, regardless of whether obtaining a tax advantage is the main benefit or not.
As a result of the change in scope of DAC6 reporting requirements in Gibraltar, in practice:
  * For cross-border arrangements not involving Spain, only Hallmark D needs to be considered for reporting purposes.
  * For cross-border arrangements involving Spain and Gibraltar, all Hallmarks (A-E) need to be considered for reporting purposes.


### Reporting obligations
The reporting obligation falls on the intermediary or the taxpayer according to detailed rules regarding the parties and jurisdictions involved.
Where bound by professional (legal) privilege, an intermediary will be exempt from the reporting obligation. An intermediary exempt from reporting obligations will nevertheless have to notify other intermediaries or if there is no such intermediary the relevant taxpayer of their reporting obligations.
The reporting obligations started to apply from 1 January 2021.
## Intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)
Gibraltar has entered into Model 1 IGA reciprocal agreements with both the United States (US) and United Kingdom. The Gibraltar/UK agreement was signed 21 November 2013 and the Gibraltar/US agreement was signed 8 May 2014. Legislation in the form of regulations have been passed.
Information will be exchanged by the Competent Authorities nine months after the year-end. The first due date for exchange by the Competent Authorities was 30 September 2016 for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 for UK reportable accounts and was 30 September 2015 for the year ended 31 December 2014 for US reportable accounts. The reporting deadline for reportable accounts is 31 July.
The Gibraltar government was an early adopter of the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS). The legislation was enacted on 22 December 2016. The first date that information was exchanged by the Competent Authorities was 30 September 2017 for the period ended 31 December 2016. The reporting deadline for reportable accounts is 31 July.
The Country-by-Country Reporting Regime was introduced into Gibraltar in 2017 as part of Article 13 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan.
Under this regime, where a Gibraltar tax resident company is the ultimate parent entity of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group with consolidated revenue of at least EUR 750 million, it will be obligated, for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2016, to file, within 12 months of the end of the fiscal year, a CbC report containing the following information with regards to each jurisdiction in which the group operates:
  * Revenue.
  * Profit or loss before tax.
  * Income tax paid.
  * Income tax accrued.
  * Stated capital.
  * Accumulated earnings.
  * Number of employees.

The report also requires identification of each constituent entity of the group, setting out for each entity the jurisdiction of tax residence (where different also the country of registration) as well as the nature of the main business activity.
The regulations also impose a requirement for a Gibraltar constituent entity to report in cases where it is not the ultimate parent entity, these are either where (i) the ultimate parent entity is not required to provide a report in its jurisdiction of residence, (ii) the jurisdiction of residence of the ultimate parent entity does not have a qualifying competent authority agreement with Gibraltar at the date the report is required, or (iii) there has been a systematic failure by the jurisdiction of tax residence of the ultimate parent entity and the Commissioner has notified the Gibraltar constituent entity that the failure has occurred. In these cases, the first reporting period is for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2017.
There are notification requirements in the regulations. A Gibraltar constituent entity must notify the Commissioner if it is an ultimate parent entity, a surrogate parent entity, or in cases where it will be filing a CbC report because there has been a systematic failure by the jurisdiction of tax residence of the ultimate parent entity and the Commissioner has notified the Gibraltar constituent entity of this. A notification must also be made by a Gibraltar constituent entity who does not fall into the above mentioned categories. This type of notification must provide the identity and the jurisdiction of tax residence of the constituent entity required to file the CbC report on behalf of its MNE group. These notifications must be made in writing no later than nine months after the year-end of the Gibraltar constituent entity.
Gibraltar has also signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) with a number of jurisdictions.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Generally, companies are subject to Gibraltar taxation on income accrued in and derived from Gibraltar.
The ‘accrued in and derived from’ principle is defined by reference to the location of the activities that give rise to the profits.
Should the activity of a business be a licensable activity under Gibraltar law, the profits from this activity will be deemed to arise in Gibraltar. Furthermore, the profits of a business that can lawfully be transacted in Gibraltar, through a branch or any form of PE, by virtue of the fact that it is licensed in another jurisdiction that enjoys passporting rights into Gibraltar and which would otherwise require such licence and regulation in Gibraltar shall be deemed to arise in Gibraltar.
In the case of royalty income and inter-company interest income, both revenue streams are deemed to accrue in and derive from Gibraltar where the entity in receipt of the income is a Gibraltar-registered company.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory is valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. A first in first out (FIFO) basis of determining cost where items cannot be identified is acceptable, but not the base-stock or the last in first out (LIFO) method.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to tax in Gibraltar.
## Dividend income
There is no charge to tax on the receipt by a Gibraltar company of dividends from any other company.
## Interest income
Companies with a banking, money lending, DLT, or insurer licence and earning interest as a trading receipt will have that interest treated as income chargeable to tax.
Interest received or receivable by a Gibraltar company arising from an inter-company loan will be chargeable to tax at the standard CIT rate. Where the interest received or receivable is less than GBP 100,000 _per annum_ , the interest is exempt from any charge to taxation.
All other interest received or receivable is not taxable in Gibraltar.
## Royalty income
Income from royalties received or receivable by a Gibraltar company is taxable at the standard CIT rate.
## Foreign income
Foreign income is not normally taxed in Gibraltar. Exceptions to this rule are interest income and royalty income (_see above_).

## Import duties
Goods imported into Gibraltar are subject to import duty at varying rates. The most noticeable exceptions are fuel, tobacco, and alcohol, which are subject to a fixed amount of duty regardless of the value, and motor vehicles, which attract duty at various rates of between 2% and 35% of the value, depending on the type and size of engine and whether it is a private or dealer importation.
## Excise taxes
There is no provision for excise taxes in Gibraltar.
## Property tax
A general business property rate is levied annually on all businesses in Gibraltar. The amount varies depending on the property and is subject to an annual review.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on the transfer or sale of any Gibraltar real estate or shares in a company owning Gibraltar real estate (on an amount based on the market value of said real estate) at the following rates:
  * GBP 200,000 or less: 0%.
  * Between GBP 200,001 and GBP 350,000: 2% on the first GBP 250,000 and 5.5% on the balance.
  * Over GBP 350,000: 3% on the first GBP 350,000 and 3.5% on the balance.


The Chief Minister announced in his Budget Speech on 11 July 2023 that the stamp duty rate applicable to property sales over GBP 800,000 will increase from 3.5% to 4.5%. The effective date of this change is still to be confirmed.
Stamp duty is also payable on mortgages secured on Gibraltar real estate at the rate of 0.13% for mortgages less than GBP 200,000 and 0.20% for mortgages over GBP 200,000.
In July 2024, the government announced that new purchase agreements and assignments of off-plan purchases will be registrable instruments with a 0.5% special stamp duty payable on Assignment of Purchase Agreement (by the assignor). This will not include sales on subsidised estates.
## Payroll taxes
Collection of employee taxes is initially effected under a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. Employers are required to operate the system without exception, keep appropriate records, and complete the necessary filings.
The PAYE regulations require each employee to obtain from the Commissioner of Income Tax a PAYE allowances certificate, which allocates a code to the employee. The employer is required to use tax tables issued by the Income Tax Office to calculate and deduct tax from emoluments in accordance with the employee’s applicable code. The employer is then obligated to pay over to the Commissioner any tax so deducted by the 15th day of the following month.
An employer must also account for social insurance payments in a similar manner, deducting and paying over the employee tax as well as accounting for employer’s social insurance (_see below_).
## Social insurance contributions
Social insurance contributions are payable by every employer in respect of every employee.
Employer's contributions are calculated as 18% of gross earnings, subject to a minimum of GBP 30.45 per week (GBP 131.95 per month) and maximum of GBP 53.55 per week (GBP 232.05 per month).
## Exit tax
With effect from 1 January 2020, an exit tax of 15% is imposed on the difference between the market value of the transferred assets that would otherwise produce assessable income under the provisions of the Gibraltar Income Tax Act 2010 at the time of exit of the assets and their value for tax purposes. The exit tax may apply in the following circumstances where a taxpayer transfers:
  * assets from its Gibraltar head office to its PE outside Gibraltar and Gibraltar no longer has the right to tax the transferred assets


  * assets from its Gibraltar PE to its head office or PE outside of Gibraltar and Gibraltar no longer has the right to tax the transferred assets


  * its tax residence outside of Gibraltar and acquires tax residence in another jurisdiction (excluding assets that remain effectively connected to the Gibraltar PE), or


  * the business carried on by its Gibraltar PE to another jurisdiction and in doing so the taxpayer: 
    * ceases to have a taxable presence in Gibraltar
    * acquires a presence elsewhere without becoming tax resident, and
    * Gibraltar loses the right to tax the transferred assets due to the transfer.


## Gaming duty
Gaming duty is levied at 0.15% on the gross profits of holders of a bookmaker, a betting intermediary, and gaming operator’s licence. The first GBP 100,000 of gross profits is exempt from this duty.
## Capital duty
Capital duty of GBP 10 is payable on the initial authorisation of share capital or any subsequent increase thereto.
