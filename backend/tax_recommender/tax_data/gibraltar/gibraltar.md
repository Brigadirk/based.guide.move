# Gibraltar
## Overview
Last reviewed - 25 September 2024
Gibraltar (the Rock) is a peninsula situated at the southern tip of Spain, facing the northern coast of Africa and dominating the western entrance to the Mediterranean. Gibraltar's strategic importance has given it a long and eventful history and an influence on world events.
The Rock now has approximately 30,000 inhabitants. English is the official language, but most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish. The currency is the Gibraltar pound (GIP), which is equal to the British pound (GBP).
On 31 January 2020, Gibraltar, together with the United Kingdom (UK), left the European Union (EU). The subsequent transition period ended on 31 December 2020. Negotiations about the United Kingdom's and Gibraltarâ€™s future relationship with the European Union are currently ongoing. 
Gibraltar's economy is based on services, the drivers of which have changed dramatically as a result of the significant reduction of the Ministry of Defence establishment and the military base. Traditionally, the local labour force had, in the main, provided support services to the Ministry of Defence, augmented by the retail sector and tourism. Developments over the last 20 years, in particular, have shifted the economic drivers from public to private sector control.
The main sectors of the economy today are financial services, e-online gaming, tourism, a vibrant retail shopping district, and port services, including ship repair and ship conversion. Gibraltar has also positioned itself in recent years as a leading FinTech jurisdiction, being one of the first jurisdictions globally to introduce specific Distributed Ledger Technology Regulations.
Constitutionally, Gibraltar is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom with internal self-government, except in matters of defence, internal security, and foreign affairs, which are the responsibility of the United Kingdom. The legal system is based on English Common Law as well as on local statute.
