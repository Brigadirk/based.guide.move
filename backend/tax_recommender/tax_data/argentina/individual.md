## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Argentina has double tax treaties (DTTs) with a number of foreign countries for the purpose of eliminating double taxation. Where, according to the national laws of Argentina and another country, an individual would be subject to PIT on the same income in both countries, it must be ascertained whether relief or exemption from Argentine tax is available under a DTT. Most current treaties specify various tests to determine in which of the two countries an individual is resident for treaty purposes.
Most treaties also contain clauses that exempt a resident of one country from tax on employment income outside the other country and on employment income in the other country if an individual is present in the other country for less than 183 days in a year, provided that certain conditions are met regarding the terms of employment.
Tax credits are available for income taxes paid abroad on foreign source income. The foreign tax credit should not exceed the portion of Argentine tax attributable to the foreign source income.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Asset Regularization Regime
An Asset Regularization Regime was established by Law 27.743 providing taxpayers with a legal framework to disclose undeclared assets located in Argentina or abroad. This voluntary regime allows individuals, undivided estates and entities to bring previously unreported assets into compliance, such as real estate, financial instruments, and other properties, under specific conditions. By adhering to this regime, taxpayers avoid fines and penalties associated with non-compliance. Additionally, the law offers reduced tax rates based on the type and timing of the disclosure, incentivizing early participation.
## Changes to income tax
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new “cedular regime” that was applied on the “highest incomes”, understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum. Under this scenario, employees, retirees, and pensioners (not applicable to directors) should pay income tax only when their gross monthly salary was greater than 15 times the SMVM at the time of tax determination. In addition, a progressive scale was incorporated, whose rates will be established between 27% and 35%. This new regime was applicable since January to June 2024.
From July onwards, the “Cedular regime” was repealed by the Government and the income tax withholding mechanism that was in force up to September 2023 was reimplemented and updated (annual taxable income 35% tax rate over AR$ 41.316.075 after available deductions was reinstated).
## Modifications in tax on personal assets (wealth tax)
On June 2024, Argentina’s Congress approved Law N° 27.743, and introduced new modifications to Wealth tax. Updated deductions and scales were settled for fiscal year 2023 and onwards. A new “Special Advance Payment Regime" (“Régimen especial de Ingreso del Impuesto sobre los Bienes Personales” or “REIBP”) was implemented, offering taxpayers in Argentina an opportunity to simplify their tax obligations while securing fiscal stability. This voluntary program is tailored to individuals and undivided estates who were Argentine tax residents as of December 31, 2023. Non-residents with a local representative may also participate. The regime allows taxpayers to make one advance payment and avoid future tax return filings and tax payments until fiscal period 2027.
_See the section for rates_.

Non-residents and foreign beneficiaries are only taxable on their Argentine-source income.
## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
### Employees with tax applied on highest incomes
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new "cedular regime" that was applied on the "highest incomes", understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum. Under this scenario, employees, retirees, and pensioners (not applicable to directors) should pay income tax only when their gross monthly salary was greater than 15 times the SMVM at the time of tax determination. In addition, a progressive scale was incorporated, whose rates will be established between 27% and 35%. This new regime was applicable since January to June 2024.
From July onwards, the “Cedular regime” was repealed by the Government and the income tax withholding mechanism that was in force up to September 2023 was reimplemented and updated (annual taxable income 35% tax rate over AR$ 41.316.075 after available deductions was reinstated).
### Self-employed workers (including members of boards of directors)
The following PIT rates are applicable as of 31 December 2024:
Taxable income (ARS) |  Tax on column 1 (ARS)  | Tax on excess (%)   
---|---|---

36,450,000 |  and on  | 8.803.500 |  35  
## Gross income tax
Gross income tax is a provincial tax applicable to self-employed individuals on gross earnings. The average tax rate is 4% in the Federal Capital (the City of Buenos Aires), and similar rates are applicable in the different provinces. Professionals who do not perform their activity in the form of a company are exempt from the gross income tax in the City of Buenos Aires. The tax is paid by filing monthly tax returns.
## Foreign beneficiary tax
Foreign beneficiaries working temporarily in Argentina for no more than six months during the year, who earn income through either the visual or performing arts or other profession, are subject to income tax on these earnings at the rate of 24.5% (35% on assumed profit of 70% of gross income) to be withheld by the local payer. Other tax rates could apply depending on the type of income to be paid.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Taxable period
Tax for individuals in Argentina is assessable on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
The earnings of each spouse (e.g. from employment and business activities) are assessable separately and individually.
With respect to registered taxpayers, the general due date for filing a return is May/June of each year.
Individual PIT returns are not required to be filed for payment purposes by employees who have no sources of income other than payroll compensation, since the tax must be duly withheld at source by the employer.
The employers should prepare, by the end of April of the following year, an annual wage tax return reporting the annual compensation, deductions, and withholdings performed for each fiscal year, which is to be filed with the tax authorities. The Informative Income Tax return has been repealed from fiscal period 2023.
In addition, employees with annual gross compensation over ARS 15.9 million (for FY 2023) (*) are also required to report their personal assets as of 31 December of the year (locally and abroad) in a separate information PIT return, which is also due on 30 June of each year.
Resident and non-resident employees who receive taxable income other than employment income are required to file an annual Argentine PIT return for payment purposes in June of the following year.
Self-employed workers (including members of boards of directors) must register with the tax authorities and file an annual PIT return in June of every year. In addition, they are required to make advance payments on account of their income tax liability of the current year based on their income tax liability of the prior fiscal year.
Foreign beneficiaries have no filing obligations, since they are subject to income tax withholding at source by the local paying entity on a final and definite basis.
Tax returns are filed electronically. It is required that the taxpayer applies personally for a special fiscal code (_clave fiscal_) to be able to access the tax authorities' website.
(*) The information is not updated for FY 2024, yet.
## Electronic invoicing
All registered VAT payers are compelled to use electronic invoicing, and the use of the paper-based mechanism has been discontinued.
A few exceptions to the use of electronic invoicing remain in force, including operations performed by certain small taxpayers (_Monotributistas_), invoicing through the use of special fiscal hardware (_Controlador fiscal_), back-up invoicing systems, and invoicing in certain specific activities.
## Payment of tax
Income tax is withheld from salaries. Employers are required to withhold these taxes on a monthly and actual basis at the appropriate personal rates applied to the net taxable remuneration of each employee.
Self-employed workers must pay the balance due on their taxes subsequent to the filing of the respective tax return at the authorised banks. Payments can also be made electronically from the web pages of Argentine banks.
The due date for payment of individual income taxes determined in a tax return is the day following the tax return filing due date which depends on the individual tax identification, _Clave Unica de Identificación Tributaria_(CUIT).
## Audit cycle
The federal tax authority in Argentina is the _Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos_(AFIP). The AFIP is entitled to audit any tax return filed by a taxpayer at its sole discretion during the statute of limitations.
An audit is an AFIP review of an individual's income, accounts, personal assets and financial information to ensure information is being reported correctly and to verify the amount of tax reported on the individual's tax return is accurate. An individual's tax return may be examined for a variety of reasons, and the examination may take place in any one of several ways.
Returns are chosen by computerised screening, by random sample, or by an income document matching program. After the examination, if any changes to the individual's tax are proposed, one can either agree with those changes and pay any additional tax owed plus interest for late payment and fines that may have been applied, or one can disagree with the changes and appeal the decision. In most instances the taxpayer may take the case to court.
The tax authority is empowered to send information requests to taxpayers which must be duly responded to using special forms. The due date for responding to information requests is defined by the tax agent but generally is 15 administrative working days from the day the taxpayer is formally notified.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is five years for registered taxpayers and ten years for non-registered taxpayers. Nevertheless, in 2020, tax moratorium legislation extended this period by one year for those tax years that remained open at that time.
The statute of limitations will also limit the time taxpayers have to file a claim for credit or refund.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There are no special topics of focus for tax authorities in Argentina. They may vary with time and are related to specific issues of the economy.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Employment expenses
Social security taxes withheld by the employer are deductible from employment compensation for income tax purposes.
All personal deductions are also deductible from employment compensation. Employees are required to provide employers the information on personal deductions via an electronic Form 572 in order to be considered for income tax withholding calculations.
The annual electronic Form 572 may be filed during the year to update tax deductions when required, but final filing must be done prior to 31 March of the following fiscal year.
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new “cedular regime” that was applied on the “highest incomes”, understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum. Under this scenario, employees, retirees, and pensioners (not applicable to directors) should pay income tax only when their gross monthly salary was greater than 15 times the SMVM at the time of tax determination. In addition, a progressive scale was incorporated, whose rates will be established between 27% and 35%. This new regime was applicable since January to June 2024.
From July onwards, the “Cedular regime” was repealed by the Government and the income tax withholding mechanism that was in force up to September 2023 was reimplemented and updated (annual taxable income 35% tax rate over AR$ 41.316.075 after available deductions was reinstated).
## Personal deductions
### Education expenses
Expenses on educational services and the purchase of tools intended for education are deductible. The deduction applies to educational expenses for children, stepchildren, or minors under 18 years of age who are dependents of the taxpayer. It also extends to those over 18 and up to 24 years old who are pursuing regular or professional studies and do not have income exceeding the non-taxable minimum income.
The maximum amount to be deducted is 40% of the non-taxable minimum income for the corresponding fiscal period.
### Charitable contributions
Donations to tax-exempt charitable institutions are deductible up to a maximum of 5% of net income.
### Pension and other social security contributions

### Life insurance and funeral expenses
Life insurance purchased from local authorised insurance companies and funeral expenses are deductible up to a maximum established annually by the tax authorities.
### Mortgage deduction
Mortgage and all other interest is not deductible, unless it relates to taxable income. However, mortgage interest paid on loans received for the purchase of personal dwelling property is deductible up to a cap of ARS 20,000 per year.
### Rental expenses

### Medical care contributions and expenses
Contributions to third-party medical schemes are deductible up to a maximum of 5% of net income. Other medical expenses may be deducted up to a maximum of 40% of all corresponding invoices of the fiscal year, provided the deduction does not exceed 5% of net income.

## Personal tax allowances
Residents and non-residents are allowed to deduct the following annual personal allowances regarding FY 2024:
Eligibility for allowance | Annual allowance (ARS)  
---|---  
Basic (provided the individual has been living in Argentina at least six months during the calendar year) |  3,503,688.17  
Spouse |  3299771.52  
Child (each younger than 18)  |  1.664.086.82  
Earned income allowance: Employees |  16,817,703.23  
Earned income allowance: Self-employed workers  |  12,262,908.60  
Earned income allowance: New professionals / entrepreneurs |  14,014,752.69  
Except for the earned-income allowance, personal and family allowances are applicable only when the taxpayers and their families, if eligible, have been living in Argentina for over six months during the tax year under consideration, and did not obtain income in excess of ARS 3,503,688.17 (FY 2024) during the same period.
## Business deductions
All losses and expenses incurred in obtaining and preserving taxable income are deductible, but living, personal and family expenses are not deductible, except for Pension Fund and other social security contributions. In cases where fringe benefits include lump-sum allowances for relocation expenses, household goods transportation, house hunting trip, and so on, only actual expenses incurred, supported by third-party vouchers, can be treated as a ‘business expense’ and accordingly be borne by the company as corporate expenses.
## Losses
Capital losses can only be deducted from taxable capital gains.
In order for the deduction to be allowed, capital losses must have been suffered in a transaction that, if profitable, would have resulted in taxable income.
Carryback of losses is not permitted.
Tax losses will not be offset with profits that must be taxed under the cedular regime.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Work permit
Foreigners working in Argentina must get a visa authorising them to perform paid work. There are two alternatives to apply for a working visa:
  * The visa application procedure cannot be started until the Entrance Permit is approved. Once approved, the worker must finish the procedure before the Argentine Consulate of the country of origin, or permanent residence in order to have the visa stamped on the passport.
  * The application can be made completely in Argentina.


In both options, the local company must be registered in order to make the request on behalf of the foreign persons.
## Temporary visas
Expatriate employees with long-term assignments in Argentina and any accompanying family require at least a temporary visa for one year. This visa can be renewed each year for an additional year. After three years, the expatriate may apply for a permanent visa.
Temporary and permanent visas are obtained by filing the company's documentation before the Immigration Authority and personal documentation, birth, good conduct, and health certificates duly certified before the Argentine Consulate in the country of origin or permanent residence.
An individual coming to Argentina not for working purposes (i.e. tourism) does not need a visa if staying for less than three months. However, if an expatriate intends to work in Argentina for a short-term period (e.g. 30 days), then a special visa must be obtained.
In order to obtain a work visa, a special employment contract issued from the local employer is required.
Foreign nationals coming to Argentina for a period not exceeding five years are considered non-residents, and are thus taxed on Argentine-source income only, provided they have documentation supporting that they came for work reasons. It is recommended that such individuals be provided at least with an assignment letter or similar documentation.
## Holdings overseas and transactions reporting requirement
As of fiscal year 2011, individuals must file an informative return providing information about holdings in companies or entities (shares, private bonds, and other company ownerships) located abroad, owned at 31 December of each year. Individuals acting as trustees, trustors, or beneficiaries of trusts abroad must also report such information.
The informative annual return must be filed by the end of July of each year.
In addition to the annual tax return, individuals domiciled in Argentina must inform the tax authorities of purchases and sales of shares and other holdings in companies not traded in stock markets. Information about holdings from local or foreign entities with public offerings in stock markets must be provided only when they give rise to a modification in the corporate control. This information shall be submitted to the authority within ten days from the date on which the transaction took place.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Employment income
All remuneration paid in cash or in kind, including allowances, reimbursements, or paid expenses (e.g. housing and cost-of-living allowances, school fees, tax reimbursements), is taxable without regard to length of residence or source of income.
Business expenses paid directly or reimbursed on an actual basis by the employer are not considered taxable income. However, lump-sum payments would be subject to taxation. The use of a company car for business purposes is not considered taxable income. However, the deductibility of the related costs and expenses by the employer is subject to limitations.
## Equity compensation
Equity compensation must be reported and taxed through the individual payroll.
Income from stock options is determined as the difference between the fair market value of the stock when the option is exercised, and the price actually paid by the individual. Taxation is triggered at the moment of the option exercise.
There are no further rules in force regarding the taxation of other equity compensation plans or taxation in cross-border scenarios.
## Business income
Earnings from carrying out a commercial activity, professional work, rental, etc. in Argentina are subject to tax. Self-employment income is taxable at the same progressive income tax rates as income of employees ranging from 5% to 35% (_see PIT rates in the section_).
## Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the transfer of shares and other participations in collective investment funds are liable to PIT at a 15% tax rate. A tax exemption is applicable for these securities to the extent they have been issued in an IPO or they have been traded in stock markets under the jurisdiction of the Argentine Security Exchange Commission (Comisión Nacional de Valores).
Capital gains derived from the transfer of government or corporate Argentine bonds and local mutual funds are exempt from income tax. Capital gains derived from digital currencies are subject to a 15% capital gains tax.
The transfer of Argentine shares, bonds, and quotas by non-residents is exempted from capital gain taxes in Argentina to the extent they reside or the funds derive from cooperative jurisdictions for Argentine tax purposes. To the extent the exemption is not applicable, non-residents are subject to 15% capital gain taxes calculated by applying the corresponding tax rate on a presumed gross margin of 90% (effective tax rate: 4.5% or 13.5%) or on the actual gain.
Transfer of real property by Argentine individuals is subject to a 15% capital gains tax calculated on the actual gain. The transfer of real property will only be subject to tax if said assets have been acquired after 1 January 2018.
## Dividend income
Dividends paid by foreign companies are treated as foreign source income. They are taxable if distributed to residents at general PIT rates, but are not taxable if the beneficiary is a non-resident.
In case of dividends distributed by an Argentine company corresponding to year 2017 or earlier, distributing entities are required to make a flat and final income tax withholding of 35% from dividend payments or profit distributions to resident individuals or non-resident payees, to the extent that the amount of such dividends or profit distributions exceeds the taxable income of the distributing company, determined by applying the general tax rules (i.e. without considering any exemptions, abatements, and other adjustments arising from special promotional laws) included in their retained earnings at the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of payment or distribution.
Dividends distributed in connection with years 2018 and following are subject to a 7% withholding tax (WHT).
## Interest income
Interest income from Argentine or foreign sources are subject to PIT. However, the interest on savings bank accounts in Argentine banks is exempt from income tax.
## Rental income
Residents must report their worldwide rental income. Non-residents are taxable only on rental income from assets, including real estate, located in Argentina. Actual expenses incurred to maintain the property are deductible.
Rental income must be included in the annual PIT return and will be taxed at the general PIT rates. However, it should be considered that income tax withholding may be applicable on rental payments, depending on the tax status of the paying entity, which will be creditable in the annual tax return.
## Transparency rules
Transparency rules can be applicable, under certain conditions, to local income taxpayers regarding foreign shareholding with passive income. 
## Exempt income
The most relevant exempt income items include the following:
  * Interest from saving accounts in Argentina.
  * Author's royalties up to an annual amount of ARS 10,000.
  * Dividends distributed by Argentine companies in connection with years 2017 and prior, provided they are paid from profits that have been subject to corporate income tax (CIT).
  * Compensation received in the performance of their duties by diplomatic agents, consular, and other official representatives of foreign countries in Argentina.
  * Severance payments paid as seniority in accordance to the Labor Contract Law, subject to limitations.
  * Overtime paid to employees for duties performed on weekends, non-working days, and other holidays according to Labor Contract Law.
  * Shares and other participation in entities’ capital gains, provided the respective transactions are publicly traded in stock markets under the jurisdiction of the Argentine Security Exchange Commission (_Comisión Nacional de Valores_) or the security has been issued in an IPO.

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Tax withholdings made by local entities and some specific tax payments might be taken as payments on account of the respective final tax liability.
A withholding regime is applicable to the purchase of foreign currency, credit card payments made in foreign currency, purchase of transportation tickets (air, sea, or land), and travel packages to foreign countries hired in Argentina. The applicable tax rate is 35% in case of acquisition of foreign currency and 45% in the rest of the cases.
Withholdings under the above-mentioned regime are creditable against wealth tax in case of registered small taxpayers (_Monotributistas_) and against income tax for other taxpayers.
Additionally, a percentage of the tax on credits on Argentine banks accounts can be taken as payment on account of the respective final income tax liability.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Social security contributions
The employer Social Security Tax is payable on the employee’s total monthly compensation and is not subject to any cap amount. The total employer contribution is 26.4% for companies mainly engaged in the provision of services or trade, provided their annual sales exceed the amount established by the regulation that is updated annually (current amounts are ARS 6,520,009,000 for services and ARS 28,997,100,000 for trade), and 24% for all other companies.
Argentine employers are exempt from paying social security contributions for the first ARS 7,003.68 per month per employee.
The employee social security withholdings, which include pension fund, healthcare, and social services, are payable on the monthly salary, up to a monthly cap of ARS 2,841,525.42 (as of 1 December 2024), except for June and December, where the cap is increased by 50% due to the 13th month salary. This salary cap is index-adjusted in March, June, September, and December of each year.
The total employee Social Security Tax rate is 17%, which consists of contributions of 11% to the pension fund, 3% to healthcare, and 3% to social services.
## Consumption taxes
Value-added tax (VAT) is assessable on the sales value of products (e.g. raw materials, produce, finished, or partly finished merchandise) with few exemptions, most services (e.g. construction, utilities, professional and personal services not derived from employment, rental), and on import of goods and services. The VAT rate is 21%, although certain specific items are subject to a 10.5% and 27% rate. The VAT is also applicable on earning derived from a self-employed activity, at a general rate of 21%. It is paid by filing monthly tax returns.
The increased rate of 27% applies to 'utilities services' (e.g. telecommunications, household gas, running water, sewerage, and energy) not rendered to real estate used for dwelling purposes.
A reduced rate of 10.5% applies to certain transactions, including (but not limited to) the following:
  * Construction of housing.
  * Interest and other costs on personal loans granted to final consumers by financial institutions.
  * Sales and imports of living bovine animals, supply of publicity and advertising in some specific cases.
  * Any passenger transportation operating inside the country when the distance does not exceed 100 km.
  * Medical assistance in some specific cases.
  * Certain capital goods depending on the Custom Duty Code.


VAT paid on purchases, final imports, and rental of automobiles not considered as inventory, cannot be computed by the purchaser as a VAT credit. The same tax treatment applies to other services, such as those provided by restaurants, hotels, and garages.
Registered VAT payers, except for taxpayers carrying out certain activities that, due to the singularities of their transactions, are required to include in their tax returns specific information, are required to use a web-based (online) modality for filing VAT return.
‘Digital transactions’ (e.g. digital services, hosting, online technical support, software services, Internet services) are subject to Argentine VAT at a 21% rate if they are supplied by a non-resident entity to an Argentine customer and there is an effective use in Argentina. The tax is to be paid by the Argentine recipient of the service unless there is an intermediary in the payment of the fee (e.g. bank institutions, credit card issuers), in which case such intermediary will act as a collection agent for the tax.
In addition, foreign beneficiaries carrying out taxable activities within the Argentine territory are also subject to VAT. The resulting tax is to be remitted to the Argentine tax authorities by the local counterpart on a reverse-charge mechanism.
## Tax on personal assets (wealth tax)
On June 2024, Argentina’s Congress approved Law N° 27.743, and introduced new modifications to Wealth tax. Updated deductions and scales were settled for fiscal year 2023 and onwards. A new “Special Advance Payment Regime” (“Régimen especial de Ingreso del Impuesto sobre los Bienes Personales” or “REIBP”) was implemented, offering taxpayers in Argentina an opportunity to simplify their tax obligations while securing fiscal stability. This voluntary program is tailored to individuals and undivided estates who were Argentine tax residents as of December 31, 2023. Non-residents with a local representative may also participate. The regime allows taxpayers to make one advance payment and avoid future tax return filings and tax payments until fiscal period 2027.
Participants benefit from fixed tax rates of 0.45% for unreported assets and 0.50% for those regularized through Argentina’s disclosure regime. Additionally, increases in net worth during this period generally do not create new liabilities unless specific conditions apply, such as donations.
One of the most attractive features of the REIBP is the fiscal stability it guarantees, extending until 2038. This ensures predictable obligations, with reduced tax rates after 2027. To join, taxpayers must make an initial payment covering 75% of the calculated liability, which is credited toward the total obligation.
For those individuals/undivided states, who decided to not adhere to REIBP, will be subject to an annual wealth tax on their worldwide taxable personal assets exceeding the minimum exempt threshold as of 31 December, without consideration of liabilities. These taxable assets include, among other items, real estate, cars, and bank accounts. However, savings accounts, term deposits at Argentine banks, and Argentine government bonds are tax-exempt. Individuals domiciled abroad and working in Argentina for reasons duly proven for a period not longer than five years are assessable only on personal assets located in Argentina.
For fiscal 2023 and onwards, new progressive tax rates are established for personal property, eliminating the distinction between assets located in the country and abroad. The rates will be applied uniformly and will gradually reduce to 0.25% by 2027.
The non-taxable minimum is increased to ARS 100,000,000(*) for the year 2023, and the exempt amount for housing is raised to ARS 350,000,000(*).
Those taxpayers ("Good Taxpayers") who have fulfilled all their tax obligations between 2020 and 2022 can access a 0.50% reduction in the applicable rate for the periods 2023 to 2025.
(*) Tax rates and exempt minimum will be adjusted annually, considering the annual variation of the Consumer Price Index.

Shares held in Argentine companies and participation in _fideicomisos_ (local trusts) set up in Argentina are not included in the shareholder’s wealth tax return. However, the respective company and _fideicomiso_ must determine wealth tax on the participation owned by individuals residing in the country or abroad, or owned by companies residing abroad. The wealth tax rate is 0.5% and is payable by the company or local trust to the tax authorities. However, reimbursement from the shareholders can be claimed.
## Inheritance and gift taxes
There is no federal gift and inheritance tax in Argentina. However, the province of Buenos Aires has gift and inheritance taxes based on certain conditions and amounts. The federal government and other provinces may introduce similar taxes in the future.
## Real property tax and automobile duty
There is no federal real property tax or automobile duty in Argentina. Property taxes fall within the authority of the provinces. Federal property taxes are included in the wealth tax.
Real estate tax is levied on the ownership of real estate properties in each jurisdiction. Automobile duty is levied on the ownership of cars registered (car plate licence) in each jurisdiction.
Amounts are determined by provincial taxation authorities based on the fiscal valuation of the asset (also determined by the tax authority) and the tax rates in force under the annual tax law. Payments must usually be made on a monthly or a bimonthly basis.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax is levied by each of the 24 jurisdictions in Argentina and applies principally to contracts and agreements, deeds, mortgages, and other obligations. It also applies to agreements and discharges of a civil, financial, or commercial nature, of which there is written evidence, or in certain instances, that are the subject of entries in books of accounts. The average tax rate is 1% applicable on the economic value of the contract.
In the City of Buenos Aires, special rates of 0.5%, 1%, 1.2%, 1.5%, 3%, and 3.6% are aaplicable depending on the kind of transactions and, in the case of transactions involving uncertain consideration, a fixed tax is applicable (on the fulfilment of certain conditions).
## Tax on bank account debits and credits
Debits and credits from bank accounts are subject to this tax at 0.6% on the amount of the transaction. However, the deposit and disposal of employment compensation and pension payments are tax exempt.
