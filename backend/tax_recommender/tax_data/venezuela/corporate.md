## Special contribution for the protection of pensions 
On 8 May 2024, a Law of Protection of Social Security Pensions published in the Extraordinary Official Gazette N° 6805 was enacted. The Law is aimed at establishing mechanisms, other than the current social security contributions, to protect social security pensions.
The most relevant considerations may be summarised as follows:
  * Social security pensionsare understood to be the monetary benefits for old age, disability, and survival provided for in the special law regulating social security.
  * The Law provides for a special contribution applicable to private legal bodies and partnerships, including irregular or de facto ones, whether or not domiciled in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which carry out economic activities in the national territory. 
  * The aforesaid contribution will be up to 15% of total payments to workers for salaries and non-salary bonuses. The applicable rate shall be established by the President of the Republic on an annual basis, according to the type of economic activity. On 16 May 2024, the rate was established at 9% according to Decree N° 4952.
  * The basis for the calculation of the payments made to each worker may not be less than the indexed integral minimum income defined by the National Executive.
  * The Law allows the President of the Republic to grant total or partial exemptions on the contribution.
  * The contribution is to be declared and paid on a monthly basis. On Administrative Ruling SNAT/2024/00042 published on 17 May 2024, the calendar for filing and payment was published. The contribution will be collected and controlled by the national tax authorities (SENIAT).

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Taxable period
Taxable years may not exceed 12 months, but the first year may be less than 12 months. Taxpayers engaged in commercial, industrial, or service activities may choose a taxable year that does not coincide with the calendar year. A taxpayer that makes such an election may only change it after obtaining prior authorisation from the tax authorities. All other taxpayers are require to conform their taxable year to the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Final tax returns must be filed within three months following the end of the tax year or at the date indicated on the corresponding calendar for those designated as a ‘special taxpayer’ by the tax authorities. The system is one of self-assessment.
## Payment of tax
The total amount of tax due must be paid at the time of filing the annual return. Estimated tax payments must be paid consecutively in six monthly instalments. Companies engaged in mining, hydrocarbon exploitation, and related activities must make 12 equal monthly estimated tax payments.
As of September 2018, weekly income tax advance payments have been set forth for 'special taxpayers'. The applicable rates have been established as follows: (i) 2% for financial institutions, banking, insurance, and reinsurance sectors, and (ii) 1% for other 'special taxpayers'. The aforesaid will temporarily replace the filing and payment obligations in connection with the estimated income tax return. As of September 2020, the advance must be remitted on a bi-weekly basis.
### Penalties
Fines for omitted taxes when assessed as a result of tax audits range from 100% to 300% of the omitted tax. The tax authorities generally assess the average fine (200%) unless aggravating or mitigating circumstances apply.
Fines are reduced to 30% if assessment is accepted within a specific timeframe.
Fines are adjusted according to the official exchange rate of the currency of highest value as published by the Venezuelan Central Bank at the time of the infringement and will be assessed on the value in place at the moment of payment.
Late payment interest is 1.2 times the average banking lending rate considering the six major banks.
## Tax audit process
According to the Master Tax Code, the tax administration is entitled to review the existence of a taxpayer’s liability, whether it has been reported or not. In exercising this power, the tax administration is entitled to obtain and verify information in connection with a determined tax liability. Verifications may be carried out on the basis of available information or on a presumptive basis if concrete information is not available.
## Statute of limitations
According to the Master Tax Code, the statute of limitations for tax liabilities is six years starting to run on 1 January of the year following the tax period involved. Regarding taxes that are assessed by periods (e.g. income tax and VAT), it is understood that the taxable event occurs at the end of such period. Exceptionally, the statute of limitations is extended to ten years in any of the following circumstances: (i) the taxpayer fails to declare the taxable event or submit the relevant returns; (ii) the taxpayer does not comply with its obligation to register with the tax administration; (iii) the tax administration was not able to become aware of the taxable event; (iv) the taxpayer has extracted from the country property that is subject to the payment of the tax liability or if the tax liability is related to taxable events occurring abroad; or (v) the taxpayer does not keep its accounting in accordance with the relevant standards.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Tax audits are generally focused on ‘special taxpayers’. The main subjects of focus of tax audits on corporate taxpayers are related to compliance of formal obligations for direct and indirect taxes and transfer pricing.

Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
According to the Venezuelan tax code, the following companies are regarded as resident:
  * Companies incorporated in Venezuela and registered with the Mercantile Registry as established by commercial law. 
  * Foreign companies registered to be domiciled in Venezuela as branches duly registered with the Mercantile Registry. 


The following companies are non-residents but subject to Venezuelan taxes:
  * Foreign companies that provide technical assistance, technological services, royalty items, and professional services from abroad. 
  * Foreign banks granting loans to local companies. 
  * Foreign companies leasing goods to local companies. 
  * Foreign companies deriving income from economic activities carried out in Venezuela or from assets in Venezuela. 


## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to the Venezuelan Income Tax Law (VITL), generally, a passive party is deemed to be carrying out operations in Venezuela through a PE when:
  * The passive party owns, directly or through an agent, employee, or representative in the Venezuelan territory,: 
    * an office, fixed place of business, or an activity centre where its activities are totally or partially carried on 
    * management headquarters, branches, offices, factories, shops, facilities, warehouses, stores, construction, installations, or assembling works, when the duration thereof exceeds six months, or

  * The passive party performs, directly or through an agent, employee, or representative in the Venezuelan territory, professional, artistic activities. 
  * The passive party possesses, directly or through an agent, employee, representative, or other contracted personnel in the Venezuelan territory, other work places where the operations are wholly or partially performed. 


Any agent acting independently shall be excluded from this definition, except if such representative has the power to conclude contracts in the name of the principal.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Companies may deduct depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of intangible fixed assets that are used in the production of income. Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis although any other generally accepted method for accounting purposes is also accepted. Depreciation is not allowed on real estate used as rental property. Depreciation on the stepped-up portion of assets revalued by any method other than the inflation adjustments (_see the section_) is not permitted. In principle, useful lives of assets shall be consistent with the parameters used in accordance with accounting principles. Although domestic standards provide that tables with depreciation and amortisation rates to be applied by taxpayers may be provided via the Income Tax Rules, such a table has not been provided to date.
## Goodwill
Deduction of the amortisation of goodwill is allowed for income tax purposes. Deduction of the cost basis for purposes of calculating the capital gain on the sale is also allowed for income tax purposes.
## Organisational and pre-operating expenses
Domestic income tax regulations do not provide for specific guidance as to the treatment of organisational and pre-operating expenses. The accepted practice is to follow GAAP.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on a loan, the principal of which is invested to generate income, is deductible.
## Bad debt
Losses arising from bad debts are deductible, provided:
  * the loan concerned was granted as part of the taxpayer’s business 
  * the amount of the debt was previously included in the taxpayer’s gross revenue (except in the case of loans granted by financial institutions or by employers to their employees), and 
  * either the debtor and the debtor’s guarantors are insolvent or the amount of the loan does not justify collection expenses. 


## Charitable contributions
Deductions for allowable charitable contributions are limited to 10% of taxable income (before deducting contributions) when taxable income does not exceed TU 10,000. When taxable income exceeds TU 10,000, charitable contributions are limited to 8% of taxable income. For oil extraction companies, the deduction is limited to 1% of the pre-contribution tax amount.
## Fines and penalties
Income tax regulations do not expressly provide for the treatment of fines and penalties; however, such expenses are not deductible as they do not meet the normality and necessity requirements.
## Taxes
Municipal, state, and local taxes are deductible in determining taxable income. Corporate taxes are not deductible.
## Other significant items
Payments required by the labour law, such as profit sharing (generally between 15 days and four months' salary) and severance indemnity accruals, are also deductible. In cases of unjustified dismissals, double severance indemnities must be paid. However, accruals for such additional indemnities are generally not deductible until paid.
Corporate tax deduction of employees' compensation and professional fees is subject to compliance with the taxpayer's obligations as employer as provided for in the Law, which entail, among others, withholding obligations.
## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for three years. During the three-year term, the amount of losses available to carry forward cannot exceed 25% of the tax period’s taxable income. Carryforward losses derived from the inflation adjustment have been eliminated. Losses may not be carried back. Foreign losses may be offset only against foreign profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Venezuelan corporation may claim a deduction for royalties and technical assistance and for technical service fees paid to foreign affiliates, subject to the following conditions:
  * Income tax payable by the recipient is withheld at the source. 
  * Transfer pricing requirements are met. 
  * In the case of technical assistance and technological services fees, the expenses may be deducted if such services cannot be otherwise provided in Venezuela. 


Foreign companies domiciled in Venezuela are allowed to deduct royalties paid to parent companies or foreign affiliates (_see the section for more information_). Branches of foreign companies, however, may not deduct such payments to head offices or related parties.


# Venezuela
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Group taxation is not possible in Venezuela.
## Transfer pricing
Taxpayers that carry out operations with related parties abroad must calculate their income, costs, and deductions by applying a defined methodology of transfer pricing. This regime is applicable to imports, exports, and interest paid to recipients abroad as well as technical assistance, technological services, and royalty fees.
## Thin capitalisation
Thin capitalisation rules limit the deduction of interest from debt with related parties in excess of a 1:1 debt-to-equity ratio. Under these rules, if the average of a taxpayer’s debt (with related and unrelated parties) exceeds the average amount of its equity for the respective fiscal year, the excess debt is treated as equity for income tax purposes. Consequently, the ability to deduct interest on related-party loans may be affected.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Venezuelan tax legislation does not provide for CFC rules but does provide for international fiscal transparency rules where income from investments in a JLFT must be recognised on an accrual basis (_see Foreign income in the section_).


# Venezuela
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Branches of foreign corporations are subject to the same tax rules as Venezuelan corporations. Inter-branch income and deductions must be eliminated. The positive difference between a branch's annual book and taxable income is deemed to be remitted to the branch's head office (branch profits tax). Such remittances are subject to the 34% flat dividend tax (see _Dividend tax in the section for more information_) regardless of whether there is an actual payment unless the branch can provide proof of reinvestment of its profits for a five-year period. If such proof is established, no deemed remittance is assumed.
A Venezuelan taxpayer has to recognise, annually on an accrual basis, income generated in a company or other legal entity it controls that is located in a jurisdiction with low fiscal taxation (JLFT). Further, investments in a JLFT must be declared to the SENIAT.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign income tax paid on taxable foreign income may be offset by the payable Venezuelan tax, up to the proportion of Venezuelan payable tax related to foreign-source income. Taxpayers must keep documentation of foreign tax. No carryforward rules are provided for in domestic regulations.
## Other incentives
Customs duty incentives are also available, such as drawbacks on the import of materials used for exporting products. This may take the form of a tax refund certificate issued by the Ministry of Finance. The certificate is a negotiable bond and will be accepted by the Treasury Funds Office for payment of national taxes. Determination of the amount of the refund will take into account the import duties effectively paid at the time the materials used in the manufacture of the exported product were received in Venezuela. Note that this incentive is not currently being applied in practice.

Notes
  1. WHTs constitute prepayments against final tax liabilities as determined by the income tax return when filed.
  2. Includes commissions earned in instances other than through a dependent relationship (e.g. employer/employee). Commissions are subject to withholdings in the same manner as salaries and wages.
  3. The rates for non-residents are similar to those rates applicable for payments to a non-domiciled corporation not resident in a treaty country and rendering services from abroad with no PE in Venezuela.
  4. Excludes payments exempted under international shipping agreements.
  5. Withholding applicable only on the excess on profits taxed at the corporate level (_see Dividend income in the section_).
  6. Domestic income tax withholding rules do not provide for withholding rates in case of resident beneficiaries. Although, in general, no withholding should be applied, a case-by-case review may be necessary.

## Exchange control
In January 2003, the Venezuelan government and the Venezuelan Central Bank (VCB) restricted the free trade of foreign currency and established an Exchange Control Regime.
The Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly enacted new Exchange Agreement N° 1 on 7 September 2018. The Exchange Agreement provides for new mechanisms for the settlement of transaction of acquisition and sale of foreign currency for the public and private sectors and abrogates the Exchange Agreements issued under the previous regime.
The VCB and the Popular Power Finance Ministry are authorised to determine the actions for development of the foreign exchange policy in accordance with Exchange Agreement N° 1:
The following three mechanisms of operations are provided for the private sector:
  * Acquisitions and sales of positions in foreign currency by persons of the private sectors and through the authorised exchange operators, presumably provided for high value transactions.
  * Retail exchange transactions up to 8,500 euros (EUR) of the equivalent value in other foreign currency per transaction.
  * Negotiations in Venezuela currency of foreign currency denominated securities issued by the private sector.


In addition, special considerations are provided for export activities and tourism.
To date, regulations for implementation of the above-mentioned mechanisms, which are to be issued mainly by the VCB, have not been published. A new means of currency exchange was created by Resolution N°19-05-01 published in the official Gazette N°41.624 on 2 May 2019 whereby national banks sell to natural and legal persons through exchange tables.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories may be valued at cost or the lower of cost or market value. Any method generally accepted for accounting purposes can be accepted for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxable as ordinary income, and capital losses are deductible from ordinary income. Note that capital losses resulting from the sale of stock, capital reduction, or liquidation of a company are only deductible if they meet one of the following conditions:
  * The cost of the capital stock was not in excess of the price quoted on a stock exchange or an amount with a reasonable relationship to the book value of the capital stock.
  * The holding period of the investment was for at least two years immediately preceding the date of the sale.
  * The stockholder proves that the company selling the shares carried on economic activities for at least two years preceding the date of sale.


At present, the tax law contains two different rulings relevant to the deductibility of losses incurred through operations on the Venezuelan Stock Market, one of which has been described above. The second ruling pertains to income obtained from operations on the local market. This income is subject to a final 1% tax that is withheld at the source. Losses in this kind of operation are not deductible against other income. Corporate shareholders not domiciled in Venezuela may not deduct such losses from other taxable income other than dividends arising from Venezuelan sources.
Gains upon liquidation or reduction of capital are taxable to the liquidating entity.
## Dividend income
A dividend tax is levied at a flat rate of 34% on the positive difference between book income and tax income generated after 2000. Book income is understood to be that approved at a shareholders’ meeting and based on the financial statements prepared pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To determine the applicable difference, a last in first out (LIFO) method applies. The tax is triggered when a dividend is paid and shall be remitted via withholding. Withholding is to be made at the moment a dividend is declared or credited to the account of a recipient. The 34% (domestic) rate can be mitigated under tax treaties.
Dividends obtained from companies incorporated or resident abroad or incorporated abroad and resident in Venezuela are taxed at a flat 34% rate.
### Stock dividends
Dividends of stock are subject to payment of the aforementioned dividend tax. Moreover, stock dividends are subject to an advanced payment of dividend tax equivalent to 1% of the dividend distributed. Stock dividends have no cost for tax purposes.
## Interest income
Unless the debtor can prove otherwise, any sum paid by a debtor in excess of the principal is deemed to be interest. As a general rule, interest is sourced in Venezuela if it is derived from activities carried out in Venezuela or from property located in Venezuela. Specifically, interest is deemed to be derived from activities carried out in Venezuela if the loan principal is used or enjoyed in the country. Interest received by non-resident corporations is therefore subject to Venezuelan income tax if the loan is granted or invested in Venezuela.
Interest paid on loans granted by non-resident financial institutions is subject to a final withholding tax (WHT) at source at a rate of 4.95% on gross income. Interest paid to other non-resident legal entities is subject to tax at a rate of 34% applied to 95% of the gross income.
## Royalty income
Royalties derived by non-residents are subject to income tax on 90% of gross receipts in the case of royalties and similar payments, other than those derived from mining activities, resulting in an effective WHT rate of 30.6%.
## Foreign income
Extraterritorial income is subject to Venezuelan CIT based on the concept of worldwide income taxation, according to which:
  * Resident companies must pay a tax on total income whether from national or foreign source.
  * Non-resident companies with PE in Venezuela will pay tax on their income, whether of national or foreign source, attributable to the Venezuelan PE.
  * Non-resident companies will pay taxes on their income originated or caused in Venezuela.
  * Resident companies as well as non-resident companies with PE in Venezuela may credit the tax paid abroad for earnings of an extraterritorial source against the income tax payable in Venezuela, subject to limitations.
  * In general terms, taxation of foreign-source income is ruled by domestic provisions on taxation of territorial-source income. Foreign-source dividends are taxable when dividends are received. However, in case of investments located in a JLFT, anti-deferral rules in the international fiscal transparency regime apply (_see below_).


### Foreign technical assistance and services
Taxable income of foreign taxpayers providing technical assistance or technological services from abroad to individuals or entities that use them in Venezuela or assign them to third parties is presumed to be 30% of gross income for technical assistance fees and 50% of gross income for technological service fees. If the contract does not specify the proportion in which the services are rendered, the law provides that 60% of the technical assistance and technological service fees are deemed to be rendered abroad (i.e. foreign-source), with the other 40% deemed to be rendered in Venezuela. The law also provides that 75% of the entire income related to technological services and 25% of that related to technological assistance is rendered abroad if not otherwise specified in the contract. _See the section for more information_.
### International fiscal transparency regime
A regime of international fiscal transparency is created for the purpose of establishing special standards of fiscal control, governing capital investments in countries classified as a JLFT, or tax havens. Under certain conditions, a Venezuelan taxpayer may be required to recognise income generated in its JLFT subsidiary on an accrual basis in its tax return.
## Inflation adjustment
A system for the adjustment of non-monetary assets, non-monetary liabilities, and shareholder’s equity has been established. ‘Non-monetary assets’ include land, construction, machinery, vehicles, installations, inventories, and investments other than in securities (e.g. bonds and stocks).
There are two phases to the adjustments: (i) initial adjustments and (ii) annual adjustments. Both phases are mandatory adjustments for taxpayers engaged in commercial and industrial operations, and in the exploitation of mines and hydrocarbons. The annual adjustment is optional for taxpayers performing non-business activities.
The following taxpayers are excluded from the inflation adjustment: (i) taxpayers engaged in banking, financial, insurance, and reinsurance activities and (ii) taxpayers designated by the tax authorities as ‘special taxpayers’.
For those taxpayers subject to inflation accounting for tax purposes, the inflation adjustment is based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).
### Initial adjustment
The initial adjustment on depreciable fixed assets requires a registration tax of 3% on the amount of the adjustment.
The initial adjustment must be filed at the closing date of any fiscal year ending after 1 January 1993. This adjustment is applicable to all non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities.
The initial adjustment is calculated by applying the variations between the NCPI prevailing in the month in which the non-monetary assets were acquired and the month corresponding to the initial adjustment. Assets acquired before 1950 are deemed to have been acquired in January 1950.
A registry tax of 3% is applied exclusively to the initial revaluation adjustment of depreciable fixed assets. For payment, taxpayers must be registered with the Asset Revaluation Registry, maintained by the tax administration. The resulting tax may be paid in three consecutive annual instalments, beginning on the date of registration.
Companies in the pre-operating stage, deemed to end with the first invoice, must determine and pay a 3% tax once the pre-operating period has ended.
Depreciation or amortisation on the revaluation adjustment is allowed, based on the original estimated life of the asset.
### Annual adjustment
The annual adjustment is applied each year in determining taxable income. The adjustment factor must be applied to the following balance sheet items at the closing date of the fiscal year. The resulting adjustment will increase or decrease taxable income.
Balance sheet items | Adjustment factor | Tax effect  
---|---|---  
Non-monetary assets:  
Inventories (including inventories in transit) (2) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Increase taxable income  
Fixed assets (3) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Increase taxable income  
Other assets, trademarks, patents, production licences, other rights, and investments in stock not registered in the _Superintendencia Nacional de Valores_ (SNV) and deferred charges (except interest). | Annual variation of the NCPI | Increase taxable income  
Investments in shares registered in the SNV | Adjusted to the share market value at the end of the year | Increase taxable income  
Non-monetary liabilities:  
Deferred credits (except interest) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Decrease taxable income  
Equity:  
Tax initial equity (1) | Annual variation of the NCPI | Decrease taxable income  
Notes
  1. Tax initial equity is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities at the beginning of the tax year, less accounts receivable from administrators, affiliated companies, and related companies. In order to determine the initial tax equity, assets not located in the country, as well as goods, debts, and liabilities entirely applied to the production of deemed, exempt, or exonerated income, are excluded.
  2. Inventories are to be valued at historical cost for purposes of applying the NCPI. The provisions of the VITL detail the procedures for applying the NCPI. The revaluation of inventories in the tax year is included as part of the initial inventories of the following year.
  3. The annual revaluation adjustment of fixed assets is considered part of the cost when the assets are sold.


More recently, there has been a delay in publishing the NCPI. To date, the last NCPI published is that corresponding to May 2022.
Net losses arising from the annual adjustment that have not been offset cannot be carried forward.
Gains or losses originating from the adjustment of accounts receivable or investments, as well as debts and liabilities in foreign currency or with a re-adjustability clause, are deemed to be carried out during the fiscal year in which they become demandable, collected, or paid, whichever comes first.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Corporations resident in Venezuela are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) on their Venezuelan and foreign-source income, whereas corporations resident abroad with a permanent establishment (PE) in Venezuela are levied CIT on only their Venezuelan and foreign-source income attributable to said PE. Corporations are able to claim any similar taxes paid abroad on foreign-source income as a tax credit. Non-resident corporations without a PE are subject to CIT only on Venezuela-source income.
Corporate income is taxed at the following progressive rates based on tax units (TU) (_see below_) (i.e. Tariff 2):
Taxable income (TU) | Rate (%) | Subtract (TU)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 2,000 | 15 | 0  
2,000 | 3,000 | 22 | 140  
3,000 | - | 34 | 500  
## Tax units (TU)
The 1994 Income Tax Law reform established the concept of a taxable unit as an element that reduces the negative effects created by inflation on the determination of the tax rates. The tax code established the initial TU at 1 bolívar fuerte (VEF), with annual basis adjustments according to the variation on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the previous year. This parameter for adjustment has been abrogated in the 2020 Master Tax Code. For 2022, the TU value, under the new currency expression enacted in October 2021, is 0.40 bolívar soberano (VES). For 2023, the TU published value is VES 9.
## Additional rates and considerations
Income for oil exploitation and certain related activities is taxed at a flat rate of 50%. Related activities are comprised of those such as refinery, transportation, and purchases for the exports of hydrocarbons and by-products for exploitation. Joint venture corporations are also subject to a 50% CIT rate.
The above-indicated regime does not apply to corporations engaged in the exploration and exploitation of non-associated gas (and the processing, refining, transportation, distribution, commercialisation, and exportation of the gas and its components) or companies exclusively engaged in the refining of hydrocarbons or improvement of extra heavy oil, which are subject to Tariff 2.
Net income from banking, financial, insurance, and re-insurance activities carried out by entities domiciled in Venezuela is subject to a 40% flat rate.
## Local income taxes

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Federal VAT (_Impuesto al Valor Agregado_ or IVA) is a one-time tax payable by the ultimate consumer of all types of products and services. However, each business entity involved in the process, from the sale of raw materials to the production and distribution of finished products to the ultimate consumer, is required to include the tax on its products to customers (output tax) and to pay the tax on its purchases or imports of goods and services (input tax), crediting the amounts paid against the amounts due on its own activities. The net amount payable by each entity is considered to represent a tax on the value added.
In general, VAT does not represent an additional cost to business enterprises because even though all types of business enterprises, including government departments and agencies (with some exceptions), are required to accept charges of the tax by suppliers on their purchases of goods and services, such amounts are normally deductible from the liability of the business enterprises for the tax on their bills to customers.
There are exceptions, principally when the sales of an enterprise are exempt from VAT, in which case the enterprise is treated as the final consumer and must absorb any VAT charges on its purchases except insofar as its activities are subject to the zero rate (_see below_). However, input tax paid on goods or services used to produce items that are exempt from VAT may be deducted for CIT purposes.
### Taxable transactions
In general, VAT is payable on all sales, rental, and importation of goods, and rendering of services executed or used in the country, although a number of significant exceptions are provided by law.
### Sales of goods
The law defines a sale as any transmission of tangible goods, including those made on a conditional basis or through an irrevocable trust. The taxable amount of a sale includes the sale price as well as other amounts charged to the purchaser for other taxes, duties, interest, or surcharges of whatever nature. VAT becomes payable when the goods are invoiced or shipped to the customers or when the price is paid in full or in part.
Exempt sales include the following:
  * Certain foods and other products for human consumption.
  * Fertilisers, as well as any natural gas used in the manufacturing thereof.
  * Some products for animal consumption.
  * Medicine.
  * Wheelchairs.
  * Books, magazines, newspapers, and the paper used in producing these products.
  * Vehicles, aircraft, and trains for passenger transport.
  * Machinery and equipment for agribusiness.
  * Scientific equipment purchased by the government.


### Services
Taxable services are those rendered within Venezuela by one person to another on an independent basis, transportation of passengers or goods, agency activities, technical assistance, and transfer of technology. VAT is payable to service providers at the time the invoice is issued, the service is rendered, or the fee becomes demandable, whichever comes first. The taxable amount includes not only the price of services, but also charges to the customers for other taxes, interest, etc.
Exempt services include the following:
  * Domestic land and maritime transportation of passengers.
  * Educational services.
  * Accommodations for students and persons with disabilities.
  * Healthcare and dental services, surgery, and hospitalisation.
  * Theatres, sports, and cultural events.
  * Food services for employees and students.
  * Certain utilities (e.g. electricity, water).
  * Housecleaning.
  * Transport services for hydrocarbon-derived fuels.
  * Services involving livestock, poultry, and other minor species, including breeding and production.


### Exports
Exports are zero-rated. Consequently, VAT is not payable on exports, including exports of in-bond processing companies, technical fees to foreign residents, and sales to in-bond processing companies and companies that export their entire production. Sale of natural hydrocarbon by joint ventures regulated by the Hydrocarbon Law to the National Oil Company (PDVSA) and affiliated companies are also taxable at 0%. Though exporters do not collect VAT on export sales, they may recover VAT charges on their purchases of goods and services by means of a refund certificate. This certificate may be used to pay other tax obligations. If such exporters carry out sales in the country, they will be entitled to recover only input VAT related to foreign sales.
Additionally, a zero rate applies to independent personal services provided by residents in Venezuela that are used solely by and for the benefit of persons abroad without a PE or fixed base in Venezuela.
### Tax rates
The rate may change every year, within the range of 8% to 16.5%. The current general VAT rate is 16%.
A 15% VAT applies to the sale and imports of luxury products (e.g. vehicles valued at 40,000 United States dollars [USD] or more, motorcycles valued at USD 20,000 or more, nickel or token game machines, aircraft used for recreational or sport purposes, jewellery valued at USD 300 or more).
An additional tax rate, subject to modification by the National Executive and ranging from 5% to 25%, is applicable to goods and supply of services paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
The aforesaid additional rate is to be established by the National Executive by Decree and will be applicable if (i) the sale of movable property or supply of services taking place in the national territory, including tax exempt transactions, is paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and (ii) sales of immovable property are paid in foreign currency, cryptocurrency, or crypto assets different from those issued or guaranteed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
The newly introduced additional tax rate will be effective as of 30 continuous days following the publication of the Official Gazette by which the National Executive is to establish the applicable rate.
An 8% VAT applies to the following transactions:
  * Goats, sheep, and minor species for slaughter or breeding.
  * Meats in their natural state, or refrigerated, frozen, or salted meats, or meats in brine of goats, sheep, and poultry.
  * Shortening.
  * Rendering of professional services to any government entity, in any level or branch of government, provided such services do not involve any commercial transactions but rather predominantly intellectual work or efforts.
  * Domestic air passenger transportation.


### Payment and collection
According to the general rule, excess VAT charged or chargeable to customers over VAT paid to vendors or customs authorities (_Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administración_ , _Aduanera y Tributaria_ or SENIAT), including the correspondent payment, must be remitted to SENIAT within the first 15 days of the following month.
As of 1 September 2018, the VAT monthly taxable period has been temporarily modified to a weekly basis for purposes of filing the final return and calculating the tax due for special taxpayers engaged in activities other than the exploitation of mines, hydrocarbons, and connected activities and do not derive royalty income from such exploitations. The advance VAT payment is based on the tax declared the prior week divided by the working days of the week. As of September 2020, the calendar was modified from a weekly to a bi-weekly basis.
## Customs duties
As a general rule, the importation of goods into Venezuela is subject to customs duties. These duties are generally levied on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the product being imported, excluding VAT.
Customs duty rates generally range from 5% to 35%. The duty rates vary depending on the product involved. In general, import tariffs are 5% for capital goods, 10% to 15% for raw materials and intermediate goods, and 15% to 35% for finished products. In addition, all imports are subject to customs handling charge, a duty import, and VAT.
With regard to procedural aspects, the Master Customs Law establishes two modes of customs declaration: (i) the anticipated informative declaration, only applicable to imports, and (ii) the definitive declaration for customs regime, also known as the single customs declaration. In this regard, it establishes that entities with competence for the issuance of permits and licences are to issue the corresponding documents, at least 25 business days in advance to the arrival of the merchandise, in order for importers to register the advanced informative customs declaration.
As part of the import process, the custom authorities may designate an Authorised Economic Operator, which will be the company domiciled in the country, involved in the international logistic chain, to serve as the substitute of simplified control procedures and customs clearance.
As result of the 2020 amendment in the Master Customs Law, reference for the determination of minimum and maximum amounts for custom services fees, previously provided in terms of tax units, is replaced by the official exchange rate of the currency of highest value as published by the Venezuelan Central Bank. In the same way, fines previously provided in tax units have been amended and are now provided on the basis of the official exchange rate of the currency of highest value as published by the Venezuelan Central Bank. For these purposes, the exchange rate in force at the date of payment will apply.
## Excise taxes
### Tax on alcohol and alcoholic beverages
In general terms, the manufacture, commercialisation, and importation of alcohol and alcoholic beverages are subject to excise taxes. The Law of Tax on Alcohol and Alcoholic Beverages provides for three main types of excise taxes:
  * Tax on the national production and importation of alcohol and alcoholic beverages, which is established on the basis of TU per litre and varies depending on the type of product.
  * Additional excise tax per litre for national and imported beer and for other alcoholic beverages is levied on the sale of those products to the public, which is also provided on the basis of TU per litre, depending on the type of product.
  * In addition to the above, another excise tax is imposed on the importation or local sale of national and imported alcoholic beverages to the public, which is levied on the sales price and provided on the basis of a percentage on the price of sale to the public depending on the type of product, as follows: 15% for beer, 35% for natural wines, and 50% for other beverages up to 50 grade on the Gay-Lussac scale.


The Alcohol and Alcoholic Species Tax Law specifies the time of payment of the tax as follows: (i) for importers, at the moment the merchandise is nationalised and (ii) for producers, upon withdrawal of the products from the establishment.
### Tax on cigarettes and manufacturing of tobacco
The importation and national production of cigarettes and tobacco, fine cuts, and other tobacco derivatives to be consumed in Venezuela is subject to an excise tax. This proportional tax is levied at a rate of 70% on the retail price of cigarettes, tobacco, and its derivatives. As per the Cigarette and Tobacco Manufacturing Tax Law, produced and imported taxable products for zones under the Territorial Customs Regime, duty free shops, and special development regions shall also be subject to tax.
The time of payment of tax on cigarettes and manufacturing of tobacco is as follows: (i) for national production, before the products are removed from the manufacturing establishments and (ii) for imports, at the time of customs declaration.
## Urban Property Tax
The Urban Property Tax is a local or municipal tax payable by any person who owns property rights or any other real rights on urban real estates. The taxable basis is the value of the urban real estate. For these purposes, the fair market value of the real estate is provided as a point of reference. The applicable rate varies according to each municipality.
## Public registry tax
Commercial companies are registered with the Mercantile Registry Office and are subject to a tax levied upon incorporation of a company and registration of capital increases. The tax is 1% of the amounts of subscribed or increased capital.
The sale of a going concern is also registered in the Mercantile Registry Office and is subject to a tax levied upon the total amount of the sell. The tax is 2% of the amount.
## Stamp duties
The Stamp Duties Law establishes a number of stamp duties on the issuance of official documents (e.g. certificates, permits, authorisations, registrations). Stamp duties may be levied at fixed amounts or at a rate based on the value of the transaction or work in question and vary depending on the jurisdiction.
According to the Law of Registries and Notaries enacted on 16 December 2021, the tax unit was replaced by the Petro (the Venezuela state cryptocurrency) as reference value to set forth the maximum amounts of payments for some services, such as: (i) authorisation, (ii) fees for the provision of services by the Autonomous Service of Registries and Notaries (SAREN) and the offices of Principal Registries and Public Registries, and (iii) processing rights.
## District Capital stamp tax
The District Capital stamp tax on subscribed or increased capital of companies is 2%.
## Tax on Large Financial Transactions
Taxpayers for the purposes of the Tax on Large Financial Transactions comprise:
  * Entities qualified as ‘special taxpayers’ by the tax authorities, for payments made from their accounts in banks or financial institutions and payments that do not involve financial institutions (debt offsetting, debtor or creditor substitution, and debt forgiveness).
  * Entities related to those qualified as ‘special taxpayers’ for the above-indicated transactions.
  * Individuals and entities acting on behalf of ‘special taxpayers’ for the above-indicated transactions.


Special taxpayers are comprised of individuals and entities with specific characteristics with regard to income level or type of activity and have been designated as such by the tax authorities by notification.
As of 19 November 2018, the applicable rate is 2% on the total bank debit or taxable transaction. As of 15 July 2024, the tax rate for the above indicated cases was changed to 0%.
The 2022 partial amendment of the Law included new categories of taxpayers subject to tax at a different tax rate as follows:
  * Individuals, legal bodies, and entities for payments performed via the national financial system either in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela: The applicable rate for these cases, which is to be established by the Executive Branch, may range from 2% to 8%. In accordance with the amendment transition provisions, the rate has been set forth at 3%.
  * Individuals, legal bodies, and entities for payments to special taxpayers either in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, without mediation of financial institutions: The applicable rate for these cases, which is to be established by the Executive Branch, may range from 2% to 20%. In accordance with the amendment transition provisions, the rate has been set forth at 3%.


The tax applies, among others, to the following transactions:
  * Debits made in bank accounts, or any other deposit instrument, held in financial entities.
  * Transfer of securities as of the second endorsement.
  * Acquisition of cashier’s check.
  * Cross-border payments
  * Payments of debts obligations (even if not executed through the formal financial system).


Certain transactions involving state-issued securities, payments of taxes, and transfer of funds among same-holder accounts are exempted from this tax.
The tax is not deductible for Venezuelan income tax purposes.
The Administrative Ruling SNAT/2022/000013, published in the Official Gazette N° 42,339 dated 17 March 2022, provides for the designation of special taxpayers as collection agents of the tax for payments received in foreign currency, cryptocurrencies, or crypto assets other than those issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela without mediation of the financial system.
## High net wealth tax 
The high net wealth tax applies to the net worth of taxpayers qualified as special taxpayers and shall be determined on an annual basis on the value of the net worth at the end of the tax year. 
Individual and corporate special taxpayers are subject to tax when their worth is equal to or higher than TU 150 million. Resident individuals and entities in the terms of the Constitutional Law are subject to tax on their total net-worth, regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced, whereas non-resident taxpayers or nationals non-resident in the country are subject to tax on assets located and rights enforceable in the country. Foreign persons with a PE in the country are subject to tax on the total net worth attributable to the PE, regardless of the place where the assets are located or the rights can be enforced.
Legal persons are resident when any of the following circumstances take place:
  * They have been incorporated under Venezuelan laws.
  * They have their tax or statutory domicile in Venezuela.
  * They have their place of effective management in Venezuela. 


The annual tax period end has been provided to end on 30 September of each year. The first taxable period was that ending 30 September 2019. The applicable rate is 0.25%. The taxable basis is comprised by the sum of the total assets’ value less liabilities and excluding the value of burdens and encumbrances, as well as tax-exempt assets and rights.
The return filing and payment of the tax shall be executed from 1 October and 30 November of each year. The tax shall be reported pursuant to the standards provided for such purposes on the tax authorities’ website.
## Gift tax
Overall, the Inheritance and Donations Tax Law, published on 1999, stipulates the taxes attributable to inheritances left by individuals. Nonetheless, this Law provides regulation about donations, which are significant to corporations. Subject to payment of the gift tax are the beneficiaries of gifts in the form of movable or real property, rights, or shares located in the country.
For tax calculation purposes, the progressive tax rate (up to 55%) set forth in the Law will be applied to the donated good. Both donors and donees are jointly liable for the tax generated from the gift.
The gift tax is applicable from the time in which the donors manifest before the National Treasury their will to donate and must be paid before the registration of any document formalising or evidencing the authenticity of the gift. Should the donation not be perfected due to express will of the donor or rejection on the part of the donee, the obligation to pay the tax will be eliminated and reimbursement may be requested of the amounts paid in this connection.
Under the transfer pricing rules contained in the VITL, the tax authorities are empowered to impute income in inter-company transactions at a price reflecting the fair market value of the property being transferred.
Before the introduction of transfer pricing rules, under the Inheritance and Donations Tax Law, the tax authorities could and still can presume in transactions involving a sale, assignment, barter, or transfer, the existence of a donation if, for instance, the price stipulated in such transaction does not reflect the real value of the property being transacted. In such a case, a gift tax may be imposed on the difference between the fair market value of the property being transacted and the consideration received in return.
Also, a cancellation of a debt gives rise to gift tax issues. In this regard, the Inheritance and Donations Tax Law provides that the total or partial forgiveness or cancellation of a loan must be viewed as a gift and, as such, is subject to gift tax.
## Windfall tax on oil production
The windfall tax on oil companies is provided in the following terms:
  * The contribution on extraordinary oil prices is a 20% tax on the difference in price when the internationally quoted price per barrel exceeds the budgeted price per barrel (for purposes of the Venezuelan Annual Budget Law), provided that the quoted price per barrel is equivalent or lower than USD 80 per barrel (i.e. the maximum basis is the difference between USD 80 per barrel and the budgeted price for a given tax year).
  * The contribution on exorbitant oil prices is comprised of the following: 
    * 80% tax on income generated by quoted oil prices between USD 80 and USD 100 per barrel (i.e. 80% on the range from USD 80 to USD 100 quoted price per barrel).
    * 90% tax on the difference in the quoted oil prices between USD 100 and USD 110 per barrel.
    * 95% tax on the difference over the threshold of USD 110 per barrel.


The tax is payable by oil companies exporting with sale purposes. Also, the mixed companies (_empresas mixtas_) created in accordance with the Master Hydrocarbons Law that sell oil and by-products to PDVSA, or any of its affiliates, are also obligated to pay the above-described tax.
On the other hand, tax exemption is provided for the following cases:
  * For mixed companies when their activities are the result of the performance of projects for new developments of reservoirs, enhanced production, or projects to remediate production, declared as such by the Ministry of the Popular Power for Petroleum and Mining, until they have recovered their total investment. Parameters to determine the volumes exempted are to be separately established by the aforesaid Ministry by Resolution.
  * Exports executed in connection with cooperation or financing international agreements.


The tax is payable on a monthly basis in foreign currency. Other terms of payments are to be regulated by Resolution.
Additionally, USD 80 per barrel is the maximum price to be used as the calculation basis for the payment of royalties, extraction tax, and export registration tax provided for in the Master Hydrocarbons Law.
## Hydrocarbons Organic Law
The state is entitled to 30% of the volume of hydrocarbons extracted from any deposit, by way of royalties. The National Executive can reduce this within certain limits, when it is shown that certain types of deposits are not economically exploitable. On 19 December 2019, changes to the calculation basis of the royalties were announced.
Persons conducting activities related to hydrocarbons must pay the following taxes:
### Surface tax
For the portion of the surface area granted that is not under development, the equivalent of TU 100 for each square kilometre or portion of a square kilometre for every elapsed year is due as a surface tax. This tax will increase annually by 2% during the first five years and 5% during the following years.
### Tax on own consumption
10% of the value of each cubic metre of hydrocarbon by-products produced and consumed as fuel in wholly-owned operations, based on the price of the end consumer, is due as a tax. In the case that said product fails to be sold in a domestic market, the Ministry of Energy and Mines shall provide the price.
## Gaseous Hydrocarbons Organic Law
The Gaseous Hydrocarbons Organic Law establishes a system of royalties, determinable by the volumes of gaseous hydrocarbons extracted from any deposit and not re-injected. The state is also entitled to a 20% share for this item.
The Law also provides that additional legislation may obligate these entities to pay taxes on hydrocarbons consumed, such as fuel. However, no additional regulations have been enacted for enforcement of this obligation.
Additional taxes are provided for in the licence agreements, which vary for each particular case.
## Taxes and contributions on telecommunication activities
### Taxes on telecommunication activities
Telecommunication services providers are subject to tax on the provision of sound and television broadcasting as well as other telecommunication services. The tax is levied on gross income from the telecommunication activity. The applicable rate in case of sound and television broadcasting is 1% where as other telecommunication services are subject to tax at 2.3%.
The exploitation of orbital resources and associated portions of the radio spectrum, as well as the supply of satellite capacity to authorised operators for the provision of telecommunication services, are subject to a 0.5% tax on the amount billed or collected for supply of satellite capacity.
### Contribution to the National Telecommunications Commission
Telecommunication services providers are subject to a 0.5% special contribution on gross income generated from telecommunication activities. The contribution must be paid to the National Telecommunications Commission.
Users of the radio electrical spectrum are subject to an annual contribution for administration and control that may not exceed 0.5% of the user’s gross revenues. In case of users engaged in rendering sound and television broadcasting services, the contribution shall not exceed 0.2% of the gross revenues.
### Contribution to the Universal Service Fund
Telecommunication services providers, except sound and television broadcasters, are subject to the payment of a 1% contribution on gross revenues to the Universal Services Fund.
### Contribution to the Telecommunications Research and Development Fund (FIDETEL)
Telecommunication services providers, except sound and television broadcasters, are subject to the payment of a 0.50% contribution on gross revenues to FIDETEL.
### Contribution according to Law of Social Responsibility in radio, television and electronic means
Suppliers of sound and television broadcasting services are subject to a contribution to the Fund of Social Responsibility for the broadcasting of images and sounds in the national territory. The contribution is levied at a rate of 4% of gross revenues caused on a quarterly basis. The rate is subject to adjustment on the basis of particular circumstances.
## Science, technology, and innovation contribution
According to Amendment enacted in April 2022, the Law on Science, Technology, and Innovation (LOCTI) establishes a mandatory contribution to be paid by companies that obtained, in the previous taxable month, over 150,000 times the foreign currency of highest value as published by the Venezuela Central Bank. 
The kind of companies that are required to pay this contribution are stock companies, limited liability companies, partnerships, communities, irregular associations, associations, foundations, and PEs or fixed bases located inside or outside the national territory with current activities in Venezuela.
Contributions established in the LOCTI are as follows:
  * Contributions made from companies related to bingos and casinos activities, alcoholic drinks, or tobacco: The companies engaged in activities related to bingos and casinos, alcoholic drinks, or tobacco must contribute annually the equivalent of 2% of gross income.

## Contribution to support Organic Law on Sports, Physical Activity, and Physical Education
The purpose of the Organic Law on Sports, Physical Activity, and Physical Education (Sports Law) is to establish the public service nature of physical education and the promotion, organisation, and administration of sports and physical activity, as well as their organisation as an economic activity with social aims.
The provision of the Sports Law are of a public nature and are applicable to the public national, state, and municipal administration and organisations, and also to individuals and legal entities that conduct any activity related to the practice, promotion, organisation, sponsorship, administration, or any economic activity associated with sports or physical activities and education.
The Sports Law creates the National Fund for the Development of Sports, Physical Activity, and Physical Education, which will be constituted with the contributions made by companies or other public or private organisations that perform economic activities for profit in the country; by donations, gifts, or any other special contribution made by the Republic, the states, the municipalities, or any other public or private entity; and by the revenue produced by such funds.
The contribution is 1% of the annual net of accounting profit and is payable by all companies or other public or private organisations that perform economic activities within the country and obtain an annual net or accounting profit of more than TU 20,000. Up to 50% of the contribution can be for the implementation of the taxpayer's own projects, provided the respective project follows the guidelines to be issued by the National Sports Institute, which will be updated every two years.
## Anti-drugs contribution
The Organic Drug Law stipulates that any company employing 50 or more employees must make an annual contribution from their operating profit equivalent to 1%. On the other hand, corporations with the specifications mentioned before but that are dedicated to the manufacture or import of alcohol beverages, tobacco, or their mixtures are required to make a contribution equivalent of 2% from their operating profit. Under the definitions established by this Law, operating profit can be understood as the result from subtracting the operating expenses from the income profit in accordance with the accepted Venezuelan general accounting principles.
This contribution will be collected by the National Anti-Drug Fund (FONA) within 60 continuous days counted from the end of the fiscal year.
Note that this contribution can be retrieved if the company performs:
  * prevention programs and projects intended for the company employees and their family environment
  * prevention programs for children and adolescents, or
  * programs to fight drug trafficking.

Contributions applicable to resident companies in Venezuela:
Contributions | Basis | Contribution basis (cap) | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%) | Notes  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Mandatory social security regime contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to five minimum salaries for urban workers | 9/10/11 | 4 | (1, 2, 5)  
Employment benefit regime contribution | Wages (normal or regular wages) | Up to ten minimum salaries for urban workers | 2 | 0.5 | (1)

Workplace prevention, conditions, and environment contribution (LOPCYMAT) | Total salaries paid to employees | No cap is established | From 0.75 to 10 | N/A | (7, 8)  
Notes
  1. Minimum salary was increased to VES 130 as of 15 March 2022. 
  2. The employer's contribution to social security depends on the company's risk qualification (minimum risk, middle risk, or maximum risk).
  3. Regarding _Instituto Nacional de Capacitación y Educación Socialista_ (INCES) contribution, the employer must contribute 2% of the total wages and salaries paid to employees.
  4. Employers are also required to withhold 0.5% of the annual profit-sharing bonus paid to employees.
  5. According to the _Ley Orgánica del Sistema de Seguridad Social_ (LOSSS), the general rule for contribution basis for the new systems may not exceed ten minimum salaries. The transition rules establish a contribution basis of five metropolitan minimum salaries for urban workers for social security purposes. No cap is expressly established in the transition rules for the housing system and work, security, and health regime.
  6. The basis of calculation of the housing contributions is the ‘Integral Salary’. The Integral Salary is a concept established in the Organic Labour Law, and it comprises the following payments: commissions, gratifications, profit sharing bonuses, vacation bonus as well as surcharges for holidays, overtime, night shifts, among others, all of which are made to the employee and correspond to the services rendered by the individual.
  7. Contributions to be made to this regime are exclusively for the employer and vary depending on the risk associated to the company. A company's risk is to be determined by the _Instituto Nacional de Prevención,_ _Salud y Seguridad Laborales_ (INPSASEL).
  8. _Ley Orgánica de Prevención, Condiciones y Medio Ambiente de Trabajo_ (LOPCYMAT) regulations do not establish a cap for the contribution. However, as mentioned, the LOSSS establishes a maximum of the minimum urban salaries. For this reason, there are several contrary interpretations on whether a cap should be applied in this case.

Other contributions (_see above_) | Basis | Contribution basis (cap) | Employer contributions (%) | Employee contributions (%)
