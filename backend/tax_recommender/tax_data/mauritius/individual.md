## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Mauritius runs from 1 July to 30 June.
## Tax returns
Income tax returns are filed in respect of a year of assessment ending 30 June on the basis of the income earned during the preceding income year ended 30 June. With the approval of the Director General of the MRA, a self-employed taxpayer may file a tax return relating to a 12-month period ending on a date other than 30 June in the preceding year.
Every individual who:
  * derives:
    * a total net income of MUR 390,000
    * gross income from any business exceeding MUR 2 million
    * emoluments in respect of which tax has been withheld under pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), or
    * income that has been subject to withholding taxes (WHTs) or
  * has a chargeable income


has to declare one's income to the MRA by submitting an individual tax return not later than 30 September following that income year on a prescribed form, disclosing income from all sources as well as full particulars of deductions, allowances, and tax credit reliefs claimed.
Once an individual has submitted a tax return, one is required to submit a return in every succeeding year, unless authorised otherwise by the MRA.
A married woman is assessed separately from her husband with regard to all income derived by her. She is entitled to claim all personal reliefs and deductions available to an individual taxpayer.
The number of dependants for whom deductions may be claimed is limited to four by either the wife or the husband.
## Payment of tax
Under the PAYE system, income tax is withheld from wages and salaries on a cumulative basis. Any final adjustment required can be made at the end of the income year when the taxpayer files the annual return of income. If tax is underpaid under the PAYE system, the unpaid balance becomes payable on or before 30 September following the end of the income year. If tax is overpaid, a refund of the excess tax is made to the taxpayer, normally within three months from the date of filing of the annual return of income.
Under the current payment system (CPS), self-employed individuals must pay tax on their business income on a quarterly basis, as follows:
  * 1 July to 30 September: Two days, excluding Saturdays and public holidays, before the end of December.
  * 1 October to 31 December: 31 March.
  * 1 January to 31 March: Two days, excluding Saturdays and public holidays, before the end of June.


No CPS is required to be submitted in respect of an income year where:
  * in respect of the preceding income year, the gross income of the individual did not exceed MUR 4 million, or
  * the tax payable on the chargeable income does not exceed MUR 500.

  * a bank or a non-bank deposit taking institution under the Banking Act
  * an insurance company under the Insurance Act
  * the Sugar Industry Pension Fund

The relief shall apply in respect of a loan secured by mortgage or fixed charge on immovable property taken on or after 1 July 2006. 
In the case of a couple where neither spouse is a dependent spouse, the relief shall, at the spouses’ option, be divided equally for each spouse.
No interest relief shall be allowed:
  * unless the person is resident in Mauritius in the income year in which the income is derived
  * where the person or the spouse of the person:
    * is, at the time the loan is raised, the owner of a residential building, or
    * benefits from any new housing scheme set up on or after 1 January 2011 by such competent authorities as may be prescribed, and
  * where the income (including local dividends, interest on savings/fixed deposit account from a bank or non-bank deposit taking institution under the Banking Act, and interest on government securities and Bank of Mauritius Bills) of the person, or the spouse of the person, as the case may be, exceeds MUR 4 million in an income year.

## Employment income
All income derived from employment exercised in Mauritius is liable to tax in Mauritius, regardless of where payment is made or who the employer is. Employment income includes salary, wages, leave pay, fee, overtime pay, perquisites, allowances, bonuses, gratuities, commissions, compensation for loss of office, tax borne by employer, pensions, retiring allowances, annuities, all benefits in kind, and reward or remuneration in relation to employment. Passages by sea, air, or land between Mauritius and another country provided under a contract of employment are exempt at up to 6% of the basic salary.
Benefits in kind include the annual value of residential accommodation, use of cars, free meals, and full board provided for employees, as well as pecuniary liabilities of employees that are borne or reimbursed by the employer. Most benefits in kind are valued at standard scale rates that are usually less than the actual cost to the employer.
## Capital gains and investment income
There is no tax on capital gains in Mauritius. Where individuals enter into a series of purchases and resales of property, the tax authorities may take the view that they are carrying on a trade and assess them to tax accordingly. Income derived from dealings in units and securities is, however, exempt from tax. Capital gains received by a resident or non-resident from outside Mauritius are not taxable.
Investment income derived from outside Mauritius is taxable in a resident recipient's hands if it is received in Mauritius or if it is dealt with in Mauritius in one’s interest or on one’s behalf. However, a tax credit in respect of foreign tax paid on such income is allowable against Mauritius tax computed with reference to that income. This normally nullifies any tax incidence in Mauritius on foreign income.
