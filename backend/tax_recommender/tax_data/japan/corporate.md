## 2024 Tax Reform
On 28 March 2024, the 2024 Tax Reform Act was approved by the Diet, and, on 30 March 2024, the 2024 Tax Reform Act, and related Enforcement Orders and Regulations, were promulgated. In principle, these are effective for corporate tax years beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
In line with the ’New Capitalism‘ outlined in the government’s recent economic plans, the 2024 Tax Reform Act explicitly states that ’wage increases are not a cost but an investment and an engine of growth‘. Achieving wage increases is therefore a top priority of the 2024 Tax Reform Act; however, it also includes measures to improve the investment environment, to strengthen the start-up ecosystem, to raise productivity and increase potential growth, and to improve the taxation mechanism for a more digitalised economy.
These measures include the following:
  * Tax credits to promote domestic production in strategic sectors.
  * Establishment of an ‘innovation box’ and changes to research and development (R&D) credit requirements.
  * Tax credits to promote wage increases.
  * Introduction of platform taxation.


In order to fund increased defence spending, the 2024 Tax Reform Act clarified in its supplementary provisions measures to secure tax revenue. These include amendments to individual income tax, corporate tax, and tobacco tax. The timing of these amendments has not been clarified, but future legislative changes are anticipated.
The 2024 Tax Reform Act also includes changes to the provisions relating to enterprise tax, _which are described in the section_.
## Consumption tax
A new Qualified Invoice System (QIS) was introduced as part of Japan’s 2016 Tax Reform, which is effective from 1 October 2023. Under the QIS, a consumption taxpayer (a ‘taxpayer’ who files consumption tax returns and pays or receives a refund of consumption tax) can in principle only take an input tax credit if such taxpayer receives a ‘qualified invoice’ from a seller that is registered as both (i) a consumption taxpayer and (ii) a qualified issuer (QII). Effectively, the new system will require sellers to include their QII number in invoices so that the purchaser receiving such invoice will be able to take the input credit for the consumption tax included in the invoice. The requirement is similar to that of a seller to include its value-added tax (VAT) number on an invoice in the European context.
Businesses (other than exempt entities) must file an application with their tax office to become a QII in order to be able to issue qualified invoices.
A new platform taxation system (‘the platform taxation system‘) was introduced as part of Japan’s 2024 Tax Reform Act and will be effective from 1 April 2025. Under the platform taxation system, platform operators, as designated by the Japanese National Tax Agency (NTA), will be obligated to report and remit consumption tax on the cross-border provision of digital services on behalf of foreign operators providing such services to Japanese customers (‘qualified platform operators‘). _Please see Consumption tax in the section for more details_.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the corporation’s annual accounting period specified in its articles of incorporation. A Japan branch of a foreign corporation must use the same accounting period that is adopted by the corporation in its home country.
## Tax returns
Corporate income tax returns (i.e. the national corporation tax return, enterprise tax return, and local inhabitants’ tax return) are self-assessment tax returns.
If a corporation meets certain conditions, such as keeping certain accounting books, and makes an application for it in advance, it is allowed to file a ‘blue form’ tax return. A ‘blue form’ filing corporation may benefit from loss carryforward and other benefits, including access to incentives.
A corporation (including a branch) is required to file the final corporate income and consumption tax returns within two months after the end of its annual accounting period. In certain cases, if a corporation cannot file the final return by the deadline, the due date of the final return may be extended for one month (two months in case of a group tax relief filing) with the tax authority’s approval. 
Large corporations (with capital at the beginning of the tax year exceeding JPY 10 million) and certain other types of corporations are required to file corporate and local tax returns and consumption tax returns by e-filing.
## Payment of tax
Income taxes payable on the final corporate income tax and consumption tax returns should be paid on or before the filing due date of the final tax returns (usually two months after the end of the corporation’s accounting period). If an extension of time for filing is granted, the taxes may be paid on or before the extended due date with interest accrued at a rate of 2.4% (for the year 2023) _per annum_ for the period from the day following the original due date (i.e. two months after the end of an accounting period) to the date of the actual payment.
Provisional tax payments are required for a corporation that has a tax period longer than six months. Provisional taxes generally are computed as one-half of the tax liabilities for the previous year, but they may be reduced by the filing of interim tax returns that reflect semi-annual results of the operations. The provisional tax payment is required to be made within two months after the end of the sixth month of the corporation’s accounting period.
## Penalties
If the tax return is filed late, a late filing penalty is imposed at 15% to 20% of the tax balance due. Where a corporation voluntarily files the tax return after the due date, this penalty may be reduced to 5% if the filing is completed before the tax authorities’ tax audit notification. The rate is increased to 10% (or 15% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 500,000 or 25% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 3 million) if the filing is completed before acknowledgement of the tax assessment notice. The late filing penalty will be increased to 15% (or 20% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 500,000 or 30% if the tax due is in excess of JPY 3 million) if the filing is completed by or after acknowledgement of the tax assessment notice.
An under-payment penalty is imposed at 10% to 15% of additional tax due. Where a corporation amends its tax return and pays any additional tax liabilities voluntarily after the due date, this penalty may not be levied. The penalty is imposed at 5% to 10% once notification of the commencement of a tax audit is received.
In addition, interest for the late payment of tax is levied at 2.4% _per annum_ for the first two months and increases to 8.7 % _per annum_ thereafter (for the tax year 2023).
## Tax audit process
Generally speaking, corporate tax audits are performed in cycles of three to five years’ duration. However, this period may be shortened in certain cases, such as: significant tax matters are pointed out in a prior audit, the tax authorities decide to conduct industry-wide audits, the taxpayer is reported in the media for a significant transaction, etc. If a taxpayer requests a downward correction of a tax return in order to obtain a refund, a high-level tax audit will also be performed before the refund is granted.
In principle, tax agents are required to notify taxpayers prior to commencement of an audit. Similarly, upon completion of a tax audit, tax officers are in principle required to provide the taxpayer with a brief written summary of their findings.
Once an audit is complete, further audits of the same fiscal periods are generally not permitted. However, if newly acquired information is obtained by the tax authorities that leads them to conclude that the reported taxable income should have been different, another audit can be commenced. This limitation on the ability of the tax authorities to conduct a second audit only applies if the first audit was conducted on-site. If a ‘desktop review’ only is conducted, with no on-site visits, no limitation applies.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is generally five years, subject to the below exceptions:
  * The statute of limitation is ten years for tax losses carried forward (nine years if the tax loss was incurred in the years beginning before 1 April 2018).
  * The statute of limitation in relation to transfer pricing tax liabilities is seven years (six years for the years beginning before 1 April 2020).
  * The statute of limitation for tax assessments of national tax returns relating to overseas transactions is three years from the date that the Japanese tax authorities issue an information exchange request to the tax authority of the tax treaty partner country (for fiscal years with a filing deadline on or after 1 April 2020).


## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Tax authorities are often focused on cross-border, inter-company transactions (i.e. transfer pricing), PEs, and significant group restructurings, among other issues.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Domestic and foreign corporations
A corporation that has its head office in Japan is a domestic corporation. The nationality of its shareholders or place of central management is not relevant.
A corporation other than a domestic corporation is regarded as a foreign corporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Under domestic tax law, the scope of Japan-source income in respect of which a foreign corporation is taxable depends upon the type of taxable presence that it has in Japan. The types of taxable presence that a foreign corporation may have in Japan align with those set out in Article 5 of the OECD’s Model Tax Convention and include the following:
  * Branch, factory, other fixed places in which business is conducted in Japan, mine, quarry, building for rent, etc., but exclude a specified place used only for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise and any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character (Direct PE).
  * Construction, installation, assembly project, or supervisory services related thereto for a period of greater than one year, but exclude a specified place used only for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise and any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character (Construction PE).
  * A person other than an agent of an independent status (i.e. Agent PE) acting in a contracting state on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a contracting state, an authority to conclude contracts, in doing so, habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise, and these contracts are: 
    * in the name of the enterprise
    * for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use, or


    * for the provision of services by that enterprise.


In the above case, the enterprise shall be deemed to have a PE in that state in respect of any activities that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to preparatory or auxiliary character.
If a person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one or more enterprises to which it is closely related, that person shall not be considered to be an independent agent.
As a matter of law, the articles of Japan’s tax treaties have precedence over the above scope described under domestic tax law.
Once a PE has been established for a foreign corporation, all Japan-source income is taxable to the PE to the extent it is ‘attributable to’ the PE.


# Japan
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation is deductible in the calculation of taxable income for corporation tax purposes. Depreciable assets include tangible property (e.g. buildings, attachments to buildings, structures, machinery and equipment). Certain intangible assets are also eligible for amortisation (e.g. goodwill, patents, trademarks).
With regard to depreciation methods, a taxpayer may adopt one of the allowable methods for each type of depreciable property, except for buildings and structures and attachments to buildings. For selected structural improvements, only the straight-line method will be permitted (i.e. the declining-balance accelerated depreciation method will no longer be allowed). Tangible property is generally depreciated using either the straight-line method or the declining-balance method. Intangible property is generally amortised under the straight-line method.
Useful lives for assets for tax depreciation purposes are proscribed in detail. For reference, the following is a list of the useful lives of typical assets.
Types of assets | Useful life (years)  
---|---  
Concrete buildings | 21 to 50 (depending on use)  
Metal building | 12 to 38 (depending on use)  
Electrical facilities and lighting | 15  
Heating and air conditioning | 15  
Motor vehicles | 3 to 6 (depending on use)  
Personal computers | 4  
Digital telephone equipment | 6  
Machinery and equipment | 3 to 22 (depending on use)  
Patents | 8  
Software | 3 or 5 (depending on use)  
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses, such as corporation organisation costs and opening costs (i.e. costs to begin the business after the corporation is established), are treated as deferred assets and allowed to be amortised on a voluntary basis.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses on borrowing are deductible in the calculation of taxable income in principle. However, interest payments to related parties in the corporate group may be disallowed in certain cases. _See ‘Thin capitalisation’ and ‘Interest expense deduction limitation’ in the section_.
## Reserves
Reserves recorded in the books of accounts, except for reserves for doubtful receivables and return of goods not sold, are not deductible for corporate tax purposes.
### Reserve for doubtful receivables
A reserve for doubtful receivables is available to SMEs, banks, insurance companies, and other similar financial corporations.
The deductibility of a reserve for doubtful receivables is limited by the following two components: (i) an estimate of the irrecoverable amounts from the debtor and (ii) a calculation of the limit in the aggregate based on either the actual historical bad debt percentage or statutory percentage (reduced for large corporations), excluding the irrecoverable amount in (i) above.
### Reserve for return of goods not sold
A deductible reserve for return of goods not sold is available to corporations such as publishers, wholesalers of books, and others, provided that the corporation sells the merchandise under an unconditional repurchase agreement.
The deductible reserve for return of goods not sold will be abolished after a transitional period (fiscal years beginning from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2030), during which the deduction limitation will be reduced by one tenth annually over ten years to zero.
## Charitable contributions
Except for certain designated donations, the tax deduction for charitable contributions is limited, as follows:
Donation | Deduction limit  
---|---  
General donation | ((0.25% of capital plus capital surplus for JGAAP purpose) + (2.5% of income)) x ¼  
Donation made to designated public purpose company | ((0.375% of capital plus capital surplus for JGAAP purpose) + (6.25% of income)) x ½  
Donation to foreign affiliate | 100% non-deductible  
In cases where a donation occurs between domestic group companies, there will be no tax implications for either the donor or donee (i.e. no deduction for the donor and no taxation for the donee).
## Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration paid to directors is deductible only in the following four cases:
  * Fixed monthly payments.
  * Fixed payments (either cash amount or the number of shares or stock options) in accordance with an advance notice to the tax office.
  * Performance bonuses, either in the form of cash, stocks, or stock options, paid in proportion to the company’s performance (sales, earnings, stock value, etc.) to directors who engage in the operation of the company’s business, to the extent that certain requirements are met.
  * Retirement compensation (the amount is calculated by the service period not on a performance basis).


Notwithstanding the above, if the amount of remuneration is deemed unreasonable by the tax authority, only the amount deemed reasonable is deductible for tax purposes.
## Entertainment expenses
In principle, entertainment expenses are not deductible for tax purposes. However, an SME, defined as a company with paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less (except for a company wholly owned by a company that has paid-in capital of JPY 500 million or more) may take a tax deduction up to the smaller of the actual disbursement for the entertainment expense or JPY 8 million. With regard to expenses for eating and drinking ('meal expenses'), a company may deduct such meal expenses as far as the expense does not exceed JPY 10 ,000 per person (excluding expenditures for internal purposes) for tax purposes, since such expense does not fall under the category of entertainment expense, effective for disbursements made on or after 1 April 2024. A company with paid-in capital over JPY 100 million is permitted to deduct 50% of meal expenses only.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Enterprise tax and business premises tax are deductible in the calculation of taxable income for corporation tax purposes on a cash basis. However, corporation tax and inhabitant’s tax are not deductible. Fixed assets tax and other taxes are deductible when assessed. Foreign income taxes also may be deductible if the Japanese corporation does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit.
## Net operating losses
For corporation tax and enterprise tax purposes (indirectly for inhabitant’s tax purposes), a tax loss can be carried forward to offset future income in the case that a taxpayer files a ‘blue form’ tax return (_see Tax returns in the section_) or if a tax loss is incurred as a result of certain disasters.
Limitations on the amount of carryforward losses that can be utilised against current taxable income, together with the carryforward period, are shown in the table below. SMEs are not subject to the loss deduction limitation.
Tax year 2015* | Tax year 2016* | Tax year 2017* | Tax year 2018*  
---|---|---|---  
Limitation ratio for large corporations | 65% | 60% | 55% | 50%  
Carryover period for loss utilisation as well as assessment by tax authorities and request for downward adjustment by taxpayer (assuming loss period financial documentation is maintained) | 9 years | 9 years | 9 years | 10 years  
* Tax years beginning on or after 1 April of the year shown.Certain newly established corporations and companies coming out of a rehabilitation process will not be subject to the loss limitation rules for a limited period.
Type of corporation applicable | Years in which full deduction is allowable | Years where regular limitation applies even if full deduction otherwise allowable  
---|---|---  
Newly established corporations* and corporations coming out of the rehabilitation process** | Seven years from establishment of the corporation or seven years from the decision of the court to exit the rehabilitation process. | For years ending on or after (i) a company is listed on a stock exchange, or (ii) the company is deemed to be rehabilitated.   
* SMEs, 100% subsidiaries of large corporations, or 100% parent corporations after a share transfer has occurred are excluded.
** SMEs are excluded.
Where there is a change in ownership of a corporation followed by certain trigger events, such as the cessation of business or a significant change in the business within a five-year period following a business acquisition, the utilisation of any carryforward tax loss is restricted.
SMEs may carry back tax losses for one year for national corporation tax purposes. Large corporations may only carry back tax losses incurred in the year(s) of liquidation or dissolution or for disaster losses. No carryback of losses is allowed for enterprise tax and inhabitant’s tax.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
In order to support a deduction in Japan for expenses incurred by a foreign affiliate and charged to a Japanese corporation, in general, it should be demonstrated that the transaction between the foreign affiliate and the Japanese corporation satisfies the arm's-length principle as described in Japan's transfer pricing laws and regulations.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Consolidated tax regime
The consolidated tax regime has been replaced by the group tax relief regime, _as described below_.
## Group tax relief regime
Effective tax years beginning on or after 1 April 2022, group tax relief replaced the previous consolidated tax regime. In order to qualify for group tax relief, (i) the applicable member corporations must be 100% subsidiaries owned (directly or indirectly) by a single Japanese parent, (ii) an application to apply group tax relief requires the filing of an application to the NTA, (iii) local tax is not subject to the group tax relief, (iv) built-in gains or losses of assets owned by a group corporation will be realised under certain circumstances prior to beginning or joining the group tax relief system, (v) tax losses of a group corporation can be carried forward into a group tax relief system if certain conditions are met, but may only be offset against that group corporation’s own taxable income, (vi) the basis of a group corporation is adjusted when it exits the group, and (vii) gains or losses from the intra-group transfer of certain assets are deferred.
Under group tax relief (i) the parent corporation and each subsidiary file their own (blue form) corporate tax returns through the e-tax system, (ii) the parent corporation is allowed to deduct losses carried forward up to its own income amount in the same manner as its subsidiaries, and (iii) in principle, other members of the group will not be required to file an amended return if one member of the group files an amended return. 
In addition, the current loss of member corporations will be allocated to the group on a pro-rated basis. To reduce the administrative burden on group corporations, however, most income calculations or tax credits will be applied on a stand-alone basis (e.g. donation and entertainment expense deductions, income tax credits, incentive tax credits, etc.). On the other hand, R&D tax credits and foreign tax credits will be calculated on a group-wide basis, and the creditable amount will be allocated to member corporations based on their respective corporate tax liabilities.
## Group taxation regime
A group taxation regime is applicable to domestic companies that are wholly owned by a domestic company, foreign company, or individual ('group companies'). Unlike the group tax relief regime, the group taxation regime automatically applies to group companies.
The key points of this regime are as follows:
  * The recognition of capital gains or losses from the transfer of certain assets (including the transfer of assets as a result of a non-qualified or taxable merger) between group companies is deferred until the asset is transferred to another group company or a non-group company.
  * Where a donation occurs between group companies, there are no tax implications for either the donor or donee (i.e. no deduction for the donor and no taxation for the donee). Note that this treatment is not applied to a group company owned by an individual.
  * A dividend received from a group company can be fully excluded from taxable income without any reduction for allocable interest expense.


A group company that would otherwise qualify as an SME on a stand-alone basis is not eligible for SME benefits (e.g. reduced corporate tax rate, preferable allowable ratios for deductible portion of bad debt provisions, partial deductibility of entertainment expenses, carryback of tax losses) if the SME is owned by a parent company or two or more parent companies of the group that have paid-in capital of JPY 500 million or more.
Where a corporation that is a member of a 100% group is in the process of liquidation and is expected to be dissolved, any loss from the impairment or devaluation of the shares of the liquidating corporation cannot be recognised by the parent company as a tax-deductible expense.
## Transfer pricing
If a corporation that is subject to corporation tax sells property to or buys property from a foreign-related person, or provides services or conducts other transactions with a foreign-related person, and consideration is received or paid by the corporation, the transaction is required to be carried out at an arm’s-length price for corporation tax purposes.
A foreign-related person is a foreign corporation that has a special relationship with the subject corporation, such as parent-subsidiary, brother-sister, or a substantial control relationship.
The ‘most appropriate’ transfer pricing method to determine the arm’s-length price shall be determined using one of the following methods:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price method.
  * Resale price method.
  * Cost plus method.
  * Other method (i.e. profit split, transactional net margin method [TNMM], Berry ratio, discounted cashflow [DCF]).


An advanced pricing agreement (APA) system is available to confirm the arm’s-length pricing proposed by a taxpayer. APAs may be unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral.
Transfer pricing compliance requirements are described in the table below.
Document | Required information | Submission deadline  
---|---|---  
Country-by-Country (CbC) Report | Country revenue, pre-tax income, taxes payable, etc. | Must be e-filed within one year of the last tax day of the ultimate parent  
Master File | Group company structure, business outline, financial conditions, etc.  
Local File | Transfer pricing documentation | By due date of tax return, to retain for seven years  
## Thin capitalisation
Interest paid on debt to controlling foreign shareholders is disallowed to the extent the average balance of debt on which that interest is paid is more than three times the equity of controlling foreign shareholders.
## Interest expense deduction limitation (earning stripping rule)
The deductible portion of a corporation’s net interest expense to a related party is restricted to 20% of the adjusted income. This includes net interest expense paid to third parties that is guaranteed by a related party, unless the interest income is subject to Japanese income tax in the hands of the recipient.
Net interest expense is calculated as interest expense less corresponding interest income. Interest expense does not include (i) interest expenses on specified bonds (issued to limited number of unrelated parties and not the public), (ii) interest payments subject to the Japanese taxation or paid to qualifying public service corporations, and (iii) interest on back-to-back repos.
Adjusted income is defined as taxable income, adding back interest expense and depreciation expense, but excluding extraordinary income or loss.
Limitations (_de minimis_ and group basis) on application of the interest expense deduction limitation include (i) where the net interest expense in a tax year is JPY 20 million or less, or (ii) the aggregated net interest expense on a Japanese corporate group basis (where there is more than a 50% capital relationship) is 20% or less of the aggregated adjusted income of the same group. 
Non-deductible interest incurred in the past seven years will be deductible up to 20% of the current adjusted taxable income. Under the 2024 Tax Reform Act, the carryover period of seven years is extended to ten years for interest incurred in the years beginning 1 April 2022 until 31 March 2025.
## Anti-tax haven (controlled foreign company or CFC) rules
Undistributed profits of a CFC (which is defined as a foreign related corporation [FRC] by (i) equity ownership [owned more than 50% by Japanese corporations or residents] or (ii)_de facto_ control) where the applicable tax rate is 30% (in the case of a paper company) or 20% in other cases are included in the Japanese parent company’s taxable income in certain circumstances. To cope with the increased compliance burden for corporate taxpayers as a result of the introduction of Pillar 2, the 30% trigger rate for ’paper companies‘ or ’cash box companies‘ under the CFC rules will be lowered to 27% for tax years of the Japanese parent company beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
Income earned by a CFC is 'aggregated' (i.e. included within the Japanese parent’s taxable income) in three different ways:
  1. Entity-based aggregation: Where all of the income of the CFC is taxable to the Japanese shareholder if (a) the main business of the foreign controlled subsidiary is not ’active‘ (the criteria of the ’active business‘ test are described in the law) and (b) the foreign tax rate is lower than a 20% ’trigger‘ rate.
  2. Entity-based aggregation: Where all of the income of the CFC is taxable to the Japanese shareholder if (a) the CFC fails certain 'substance' and 'administration and control' tests and is thereby treated as a 'paper company' or 'cash box company' and (b) the foreign tax rate is lower than a 30% ’trigger‘ rate (27% for tax years of the Japanese parent company beginning on or after 1 April 2024).
  3. Income-based aggregation: Where even if the entity-based aggregation rules are not applicable, the relevant income of the CFC is taxable to the Japanese shareholder if (a) income of the CFC includes certain 'passive' categories of income and (b) the foreign tax rate is lower than a 20% 'trigger' rate.


A Japanese corporation owning a 10% or more direct or indirect interest in a CFC is required to include its pro-rata share of the taxable retained earnings of the CFC in its gross income under certain circumstances. Dividends paid by a CFC are not deductible when calculating the undistributed profits for aggregation purposes.
To cope with the increased compliance burden for corporate taxpayers as a result of the introduction of Pillar 2, the 30% trigger rate for ’paper companies‘ or ’cash box companies‘ under the CFC rules will be lowered to 27% for tax years of the Japanese parent company beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
## Anti-tax avoidance rule requiring reduction in basis of subsidiary’s shares after receiving dividends from subsidiary
Where a Japanese parent receives from certain subsidiaries*, dividends that exceed in the aggregate 10% of the book value of the shares of that subsidiary in a given year, and subject to certain exceptions that are provided in the law, the parent must reduce its basis in the shares of the subsidiary by the amount of the dividends subject to the dividend income exclusion. This rule is designed to prevent the parent from reducing any capital gain arising on a subsequent transfer of such subsidiary’s shares by first receiving dividends from the subsidiary.
* A subsidiary with which the parent has a more than 50% control relationship as of the date of the dividend resolution.
## Corporate tax measures for reorganisations
Most forms of corporate reorganisation can be treated as tax qualified if certain conditions are met. One of the main conditions is that there should be no ’boot‘ (i.e. there should be no cash consideration); there is some relaxation of this rule in the case of minority squeeze outs. In addition, there should be continuity of direct or indirect shareholder ownership; if the relationship continues at less than 100% ownership, various other conditions must be met.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Branch profits are taxed in the same manner as corporate profits. However, the family corporation tax does not apply to a branch of a foreign corporation. In addition, no withholding tax (WHT) is imposed on the repatriation of branch profits to the home office.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
A Japanese corporation is subject to Japanese corporate income taxes on its worldwide income. However, to avoid double taxation of foreign-source income, Japanese corporations are allowed to claim a tax credit against corporation and inhabitant’s taxes for foreign income taxes paid directly.
Creditable foreign taxes are defined as taxes that (i) are incurred directly by the taxpayer; (ii) are levied by foreign governments and local authorities in accordance with local tax laws; (iii) are levied on corporate income; and (iv) have the same characteristics as Japanese income tax, corporation tax, and local income-based taxes. A tax for which a refund can be claimed optionally by the taxpayer after the tax payment, or a tax whose payment grace period can be decided by the taxpayer, is not regarded as a foreign tax.
In order to prevent the credit from reducing corporation tax on Japan-source income, certain limitations are set on the amount of foreign taxes that can actually be credited. The ceiling is currently 35% of the foreign taxes paid. The creditable foreign tax is calculated using the following formula:
Corporate tax liabilities x (Foreign source income / Worldwide income taxable in Japan)
Any excess amount over the ceiling is carried forward for three years.
A foreign tax credit is not applicable for enterprise tax purposes, although foreign branch income attributable to business conducted outside Japan is exempt from enterprise tax.
Generally speaking, the foreign tax credit system does not apply to the extent dividend income from a foreign subsidiary is subject to the dividend exemption system.
Foreign corporations with a PE in Japan should note that when the PE of a foreign corporation in Japan is subject to taxation in Japan as well as in another jurisdiction other than its country of residence, double taxation may arise. To alleviate any unfair tax burden, a foreign tax credit regime is also applicable to PEs in Japan similar to that which applies to Japanese corporations. However, foreign tax (including WHT) paid in the foreign corporation’s country of residence would not, in principle, be creditable.
Foreign taxes paid under the following circumstances are not creditable: (i) foreign taxes levied on payments between foreign corporations, on the grounds that such payments were deemed to have been made to the Japanese corporation, and (ii) foreign taxes levied on a payment from a foreign PE to its Japanese head office or another related party as a result of the foreign tax authorities disallowing a deduction at the level of the PE.
## Innovation box
For patent rights or copyrights related to AI technology that a company has researched and developed itself in Japan, a new ’innovation box‘ will permit 30% of the ’qualified income‘ generated from that technology to be included as deductible expenses for the fiscal years beginning 1 April 2025 until 31 March 2032. To benefit from the innovation box, the revenue generated must arise from the assignment of the intellectual property (IP) rights to a Japanese individual tax resident or domestic corporation (excluding a related party) or from the loan of the IP rights to a third party, either resident or non-resident. To avoid ’double dipping‘ of the tax benefit, access to R&D credits for companies applying the innovation box will become more restrictive from 1 April 2026.
## Tax credit for research and development (R&D) costs
R&D tax incentives (the R&D tax credit system) are available for expenditure on R&D where the intellectual property arising therefrom is owned by the Japanese taxpayer.
The R&D tax credit formula is shown in the following table:
Movement in R&D ratio (increase or decrease in ratio) | Tax credit ratio  
---|---  
12% < | 11.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio - 12%) × 0.375 (upper limit of 14%)  
12% ≧ | 11.5% – (12%－movement in R&D ratio) × 0.25 (lower limit is 1%)  
As a result of the introduction of the innovation box regime, the R&D tax credit formula has been revised as follows:
Fiscal year | Tax credit ratio  
---|---  
Beginning on or after 1 April 2026 | 8.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio) × 8.5/30 (lower limit is 0%)   
Beginning on or after 1 April 2029 | 8.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio) × 8.5/27.5 (lower limit is 0%)  
Beginning on or after 1 April 2031 | 8.5%＋(movement in R&D ratio) × 8.5/25 (lower limit is 0%)  
The tax credit limitation for certain R&D is 20% of the corporate tax liability, with additional rate up to 10% added depending upon the movement in the R&D ratio. An additional R&D credit of up to 10% for open innovation is also available.
## Salary increase tax credits
The salary increase tax credit is available for corporations filing 'blue form' tax returns that meet certain conditions relating to increased expenditure on salary and other employee-related expenses.
As a result of the 2024 Tax Reform Act, the application for this credit will be extended for three more years, the existing minimum tax credit will be reduced from 15% to 10%, and the maximum tax credit rate (the rate multiplied by the increased salary amount) will be increased from 30% to 35%, while the upper ceiling of the tax credit (20% of corporate tax payable) will remain unchanged. The eligibility requirements for the maximum rate will be tightened in some cases; however, the maximum rate will also be extended to new cases.
## Tax credit for domestic production in strategic sectors
As a part of the 2024 Tax Reform Act, a tax credit designed to encourage domestic production in sectors considered strategically important by the government is established. Products that qualify for the tax credit include electric vehicles, green steel, green chemicals, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and semiconductors. The credit amount is based on either the quantity of goods produced and sold within ten years after the date of certification of an approved business plan under the Industrial Competitiveness Enhancement Act (ICEA) but before 31 March 2027 or the acquisition cost of qualified assets used for such production, whichever is smaller. The maximum tax credit in each year will be 40% (20% for semiconductor) of the corporate tax liability, with a carryover period of four years. In addition, a required level of either wage increase or capital investment must be met to be eligible for the benefit.
## Incentives for the revitalisation of local ‘hubs’
A taxpayer may be eligible for tax incentives if it relates to or expands certain kinds of operations in local areas (generally other than Tokyo, Osaka, or Nagoya).
## Local government contributions
As part of the Regional Revitalization Act, ‘blue form’ corporate tax filers who make donations to approved regional donation plans up until 31 March 2025 will be able to claim a tax credit against corporate, enterprise, and inhabitant’s taxes in addition to taking a deduction from the corporate tax. This is known as the corporate hometown tax, or _furusato nozei_ system.

Notes
  1. These rates apply only to corporate shareholders. The applicable treaty should be checked for conditions required to claim the reduced rate. Note that WHT may be subject to the income surtax of 2.1% (_see the section: Dividend income, Interest income, Royalty income_).
  2. The applicable treaty should be reviewed because certain tax treaties exclude film royalties and/or gains from copyright transfers from taxable income. Note that WHT may be subject to the income surtax of 2.1% _(see the section: Dividend income, Interest income, Royalty income_).
  3. 15% for publicly traded shares (for non-resident individuals, only applicable to minority interests [less than 3% ownership]) and investment trusts. Note that WHT may be subject to the income surtax of 2.1% (_see the section: Dividend income, Interest income, Royalty income_).
  4. Interest on bank deposits and/or certain designated financial instruments is subject to a 15% national WHT and 5% local inhabitants WHT (20% combined). Taxation of such interest is fully realised by tax withholding, so resident individuals are not required to aggregate such interest income with other income. Interest on loans made by resident individuals is not subject to WHT; instead, it is taxed in the aggregate with other income. Such WHT is subject to the income surtax of 2.1% (_see the section: Dividend income, Interest income, Royalty income_).
  5. Dividends, interest, and royalties earned by non-resident individuals and/or foreign corporations are subject to a 20% national WHT under Japanese domestic tax laws in principle. An exceptional rate of 15% is applied to interest on bank deposits and certain designated financial instruments. Interest on loans, however, is taxed at a 20% rate. A special exemption from WHT applies to certain long-term corporate bonds issued to non-residents in foreign countries. Note that WHT may be subject to the income surtax of 2.1% (_see the section: Dividend income, Interest income, Royalty income_).
  6. Tax treaties with many countries provide reduced tax rates, as indicated. Some treaties, however, provide higher tax rates (e.g. Brazil, Thailand), although the rate under domestic law will be the maximum rate. Still other treaties do not provide rates at all (e.g. Egypt). In these instances, rates specified under Japanese domestic tax laws apply.
  7. The tax treaty was concluded mainly for the purpose of information exchange.
  8. The tax treaties with Brazil and Thailand provide 25% tax rates for certain income. However, the WHT rate cannot exceed 20.42% (including the income surtax of 2.1%) on any income to be received by a non-resident taxpayer of Japan under Japanese income tax law.
  9. The treaty with the former Czechoslovakia is applied to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. It stipulates that cultural royalties are tax exempt.
  10. The treaty with the former USSR is applied to Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
  11. Tax treaties with many countries provide reduced rates where the recipients of interest are government organisations and financial institutions.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Requirement for banks to collect and remit information regarding bank accounts owned by non-residents
A tax reporting system is applicable under which non-resident individuals are required to report certain information to the tax authorities in Japan. The individual will provide the information to the relevant branch of the Japanese financial institution with which they have a deposit, and the financial institution will provide it to the tax authorities. The required information is: (i) name, (ii) address, (iii) date of birth, (iv) resident country, and (v) taxpayer identification number. The financial institution will also provide account details (balances, transactions, etc.). The information is required as of 31 December and must be submitted by the following 30 April.
## Requirement for crypto asset traders to collect and remit information regarding crypto asset transaction reports of non-residents
Based on the OECD's Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF: Crypto­Asset Reporting Framework) designed by the OECD’s tax committee, a tax reporting system similar to that in place for bank account information will be introduced effective 1 January 2026. Under the reporting system, non-resident individuals are required to report certain information to the Japanese tax authorities. The required information includes (i) name, (ii) address, (iii) date of birth, (iv) resident country, and (v) taxpayer identification number.
## E-Storage requirements
The Electronic Bookkeeping Act prescribes rules for how different categories of documents should be stored in electronic format. The categories include:
  1. National tax-related books, which are defined as accounting books required to be kept pursuant to the provisions of national tax laws, including journals, general ledgers, etc.
  2. National tax-related documents, which are defined as documents required to be kept pursuant to the provisions of national tax laws, including invoices, contracts, financial statements, etc, where the original document is in paper.
  3. Electronic transactions ('e-transactions'), which refers to national tax-related documents where the original document is in electronic format only, for example, a PDF invoice sent via email.


Generally, documents under (i) and (ii) must be stored in paper copy. Taxpayers may elect to keep such documents in electronic format, but in order to do so must comply with the requirements of the Electronic Bookkeeping Act. In contrast, from 1 January 2024, it is mandatory for documents under (iii) to be stored electronically in accordance with the specific rules for e-transactions provided in the Electronic Bookkeeping Act. Exemptions to this mandatory requirement may be available in certain circumstances.


# Japan
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
The taxable income of a corporation is the aggregate income from all sources. There is no specific requirement to differentiate between the types of income. In principle, accounting for tax purposes follows Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Japan, and income of a corporation is determined on an accrual basis.
## Inventory valuation
Inventory cost should be determined by applying one of the following methods accepted for corporate tax purposes: actual individual cost, first in first out (FIFO), weighted average, moving average, most recent retail, selling price reduction, and lower of cost or market.
## Capital gains
Capital gains and losses are classified as ordinary income and losses, respectively.
Under certain circumstances (e.g. qualified reinvestment, exchange of property), taxes generally levied on capital gains may be deferred (i.e. provided rollover relief) as long as certain requirements are met. A special relief is available in the case of expropriation of real property by either the national or a local government.
The recognition of capital gains or losses from the transfer of certain assets between group companies is to be deferred until the asset is transferred to a non-group company.
## Dividend income
The threshold ownership percentage for corporate dividend exclusion is illustrated in the following table.
A holding period of six months or more until the tax year-end for which the dividend will be paid is required to be eligible for the dividend income exclusion for ownership percentages of between 1/3 to 100%. The dividend income exclusion for ‘other domestic corporation’ and ‘portfolio investment’ is allowed by reference to the ownership percentage as of the tax year-end for which the dividend will be paid.
Type of investment | Ownership % | Exclusion %  
---|---|---  
Wholly owned domestic subsidiary | 100% | 100%  
Affiliated domestic corporation | More than 1/3 | 100% less allocable interest  
Other domestic corporation | More than 5% but less than 1/3 | 50%  
Portfolio investment | Less than 5% | 20%*  
Exchange trust fund (ETF) | 20% (treated as a portfolio investment)  
Other investment trusts | 0%  
* For dividends from portfolio investments received by insurance companies, the exclusion percentage will be 40%.
95% of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a foreign corporation in which it has held at least 25% of the outstanding shares for a continuous period of six months or more, ending on the date on which the dividend is declared, can be excluded from the company’s taxable income. The ownership percentage may be reduced depending on the terms of a tax treaty between Japan and the jurisdiction of the foreign corporation. 100% of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a foreign controlled corporation (CFC) can be excluded from the company’s taxable income to the extent that the dividend is distributed from income of the CFC that was subject to taxation by the Japanese corporation under the CFC regime.
Dividends received from foreign corporations where the dividend is deductible for corporate tax purposes in the foreign corporation’s jurisdiction are outside the scope of the dividend exclusion regime. As a result, any dividends paid to domestic corporations under so-called ‘mandatorily redeemable preferred shares’ issued by Australian or Brazilian subsidiaries, where the dividends are paid in a manner similar to interest and are deductible for local tax purposes, are not excluded from taxation in Japan.
Any foreign tax imposed on a taxable dividend in Japan will be eligible for foreign tax credit relief.
WHT for dividends is applicable at a rate of 15% national tax and 5% local tax (or 20% [national tax] depending on the type of stock from which the dividends were received), and a tax credit may also be available. The national tax portion of the WHT is subject to an income surtax of 2.1%, which is levied for dividends received for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.315% (or 20.42%) is levied.
Effective 1 October 2023, WHT between domestic corporations will be eliminated if the dividends are paid to a Japanese company by the following Japanese companies: (i) a 100% subsidiary or (ii) a company where the recipient directly holds greater than 1/3 of the paying company on the dividend record date.
## Interest income
Interest (on bonds or deposits) received is included in taxable income. WHT for interest is applicable at a rate of 15% national tax (for both corporate and individual recipients) and 5% local tax (for individual recipients only), and a tax credit may be available. As with dividend income, the national tax portion of the WHT is subject to an income surtax of 2.1%, which is levied for interest income earned for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.315% is levied for individual recipients and 15.315% for corporate recipients. Interest on loans is only subject to WHT of 20.42% (20% national tax plus surtax) if the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation.
## Royalty income
Royalty income is subject to corporate taxation in the same manner as other income. If the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation, WHT on royalty income is applied at the rate of 20% national tax and a surtax of 2.1%, which surtax is levied for royalties received for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.42% is levied.
## Real estate rental income
Real estate rental income is subject to corporate taxation in the same manner as other income. If the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation, WHT on real estate rental income is applied at the rate of 20% national tax and a surtax of 2.1%, which surtax is levied for rental income received for the period from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 20.42% is levied.
Real estate capital gain is subject to corporate taxation in the same manner as other income. If the recipient is a non-resident or a foreign corporation, WHT on real estate capital gain is applied at the rate of 10% national tax and a surtax of 2.1%. Rental income is also subject to a rate of 10% national tax, and a surtax of 2.1% will be applied for rental income received from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2037. As a result, total WHT of 10.21% is levied.
In contrast to the financial income described above (i.e. interest, dividends, royalties), real estate rental income and capital gains are subject to corporate income tax for a non-resident or a foreign corporation. WHT is creditable from this corporate tax liability by the filing of a corporate tax return.
## Foreign income
A domestic corporation is subject to Japanese corporate income taxes on its worldwide income. However, to avoid double taxation of foreign-source income, such corporations are allowed to claim a tax credit against corporation and inhabitants’ taxes for foreign income taxes paid directly. _See Foreign tax credit in the section for more information_.
Undistributed profits of a foreign subsidiary (i.e. a CFC) for which the applicable tax rate is 30% (in the case of a shell company; the rate will be reduced to 27% for tax years of the Japanese parent beginning on or after 1 April 2024) or 20% are included in the Japanese parent company’s taxable income under certain conditions. _See Anti-tax haven (CFC) rules in the section for more information_.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
A domestic corporation in Japan is taxed on its worldwide income, including foreign branch income. However, 95% of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a foreign company in which it has held at least 25% (or lower, depending on the relevant tax treaty) of the outstanding shares of that foreign company for a continuous period of six months or more can be excluded from the company’s taxable income. _See the description of Dividend income in the section for more information_.
A foreign corporation is taxed only on its Japan-source income. A foreign corporation with a permanent establishment (PE) in Japan is liable for corporate income taxes only on the income attributable to the PE.
## Corporate tax
Corporate tax rates for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 are provided in the table below.
Company size and income | Corporate tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Paid-in capital of over 100 million Japanese yen (JPY) | 23.2  
Paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less, except for a company wholly owned by a company that has paid-in capital of JPY 500 million or more:  
First JPY 8 million _per annum_ | 15.0  
First JPY 8 million _per annum_ if the annual average taxable income for the three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year in question exceeds JPY 1.5 billion | 19.0  
Over JPY 8 million _per annum_ | 23.2  
## National local corporate tax
National local corporate tax for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 is a fixed rate of 10.3% of the corporate tax liability.
## Enterprise tax (and special corporate business tax)
Enterprise tax is calculated in different ways depending on the capital base of the taxpayer. For small and medium sized enterprises, enterprise tax is calculated based on the taxpayer’s income only. However, for large enterprises, the calculation will also refer to the taxpayer’s capital base and its 'value added base' (which will include items such as personnel costs and rent). Therefore, loss-making large enterprises may still be liable to pay enterprise tax.
As part of the 2024 Tax Reform Act, taxpayers subject to size-based enterprise tax in the previous fiscal year will now be subject to size-based enterprise tax in the current year if the total amount of paid-in capital and capital surplus exceeds JPY 1 billion, regardless of whether their paid-in capital is JPY 100 million or less at the end of the current fiscal year. Additionally, taxpayers that are wholly owned subsidiaries of corporations whose total paid-in capital and capital surplus exceeds JPY 5 billion and where the total paid-in capital of the taxpayer is JPY 100 million or less but the total paid-in capital and capital surplus together exceeds JPY 200 million will also be subject to size-based enterprise tax.
As a transitional measure, a tax credit is available for certain taxpayers to relieve the additional enterprise tax burden that may arise until 1 April 2026.
The standard enterprise rates for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 are shown in the table below. Rates for Tokyo, which applies a higher-than-standard rate are shown in parentheses. Note that special enterprise tax rates are applicable to corporations engaged in energy or gas supply and in insurance, which are not provided here.
Special corporate business tax is a national tax but is collected through the enterprise tax return.
Taxable base | Paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less | Paid-in capital in excess of JPY 100 million  
---|---|---  
Value added base | - | 1.26  
Capital base | - | 0.525  
Income base *  
First JPY 4 million | 3.5 (3.75) | 1.18  
Next JPY 4 million | 5.3 (5.665)  
Over JPY 8 million** | 7.0 (7.48)  
Special local corporate tax (the rate is multiplied by the income base of enterprise tax) | 37 | 260  
* Tax rates shown in parentheses for corporations with paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less reflect a higher-than-standard tax rate, which will apply to where the corporation has annual income over JPY 25 million or annual revenue over JPY 200 million (notwithstanding the lower capital amount). ** If the paid-in capital of a corporation is less than JPY 100 million but at least JPY 10 million, and the corporation has places of business in more than two prefectures, the graduated rates are not applicable, and only the highest rate will be applied.
## Inhabitants' tax
Inhabitants’ tax is imposed on a corporation’s income allocated to each prefecture and city (or municipal borough). The allocation is generally made on the basis of the number of employees, in the same way as enterprise tax. Applicable rates for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 April 2024 are shown below.
Inhabitants' tax | Standard rate (%) | Maximum rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Prefectural portion | 1.0 | 2.0  
Municipal portion | 6.0 | 8.4  
In addition to the above, inhabitants’ tax is imposed on a _per capita_ basis, in the range from JPY 70,000 (in cases where the amount of paid-in capital is JPY 10 million or less and the number of employees in each prefecture and city is 50 or less) to JPY 3.8 million (in cases where the amount of paid-in capital is over JPY 5 billion and the number of employees in each prefecture and city is over 50). The actual inhabitants’ tax amount will be determined by each local government by the factors of paid-in capital and the number of employees.
## Effective statutory tax rate
The total corporate income tax burden (i.e. effective tax rate) varies depending upon the size of a company’s paid-in capital. Since enterprise tax is deductible, the effective tax rate is less than the total of the statutory rates of national and local corporate tax, enterprise tax and inhabitants’ tax.The following is the summary of the effective statutory tax rates in the case of corporations operating in Tokyo (without consideration of value-based and capital-based enterprise tax):
Paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less | Paid-in capital in excess of JPY 100 million   
---|---  
Corporate tax | 23.2% | 23.2%  
Local corporate tax  | 2.390% (23.2% x 10.3%) | 2.390% (23.2% x 10.3%)  
Enterprise tax | 7.48% | 1.18%  
Special corporate business tax | 2.59% (7.0% x 37%) | 2.600% (1.0% x 260%)  
Inhabitants’ tax | 2.413% (23.2% x 10.3%) | 2.413% (23.2% x 10.3%)  
Total | 38.073% | 31.783%  
Effective statutory tax rate * | 34.59% | 30.62%  
  * Effective tax rate is calculated after deducting the enterprise tax and special corporate business tax.


## Global Minimum Tax (Pillar 2)
Effective for consolidated accounting years beginning on or after 1 April 2024, the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) as part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Global Minimum Tax (‘Pillar 2’) will be applicable to Japanese headquartered multinational corporations, and to Japanese subsidiaries of foreign headquartered multinationals, where the worldwide gross revenue of the ultimate parent entity in two or more of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year is 750 million euros (EUR) or more. Such corporations will be subject to the new Global Minimum Tax on the minimum taxable amount, and the new Global Minimum Local Corporate Tax on the resulting Global Minimum Corporate Tax amount, for each applicable fiscal year.
In addition, filing of the GloBE Information Return to the tax authorities is also required for consolidated accounting years beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
Other parts of Pillar 2, such as the qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT) and the under-taxed profits rule (UTPR) will be introduced in subsequent tax reforms.

Japan’s consumption tax (value-added tax or VAT) is levied when a business enterprise transfers goods, provides services, or imports goods into Japan. The general rate is 10%; however, a lower rate of 8% applies to food and beverages (excluding when purchased in restaurants and alcoholic beverages) and to newspaper subscriptions that meet certain criteria. Exports and certain services to non-residents are taxed at a zero rate. Specified transactions, such as sales or lease of land, sales of securities, and provision of public services, are not subject to taxation.
Consumption tax paid by a corporation that is attributable to taxable revenue shall be creditable/refundable by filing a consumption tax return to the extent that such transaction is recorded in the accounting books and relevant invoices are kept.
A new Qualified Invoice System (QIS) was introduced as part of Japan’s 2016 Tax Reform, which is effective from 1 October 2023. Under the QIS, a consumption taxpayer (a ‘taxpayer’ who files consumption tax returns and pays or receives a refund of consumption tax) can in principle only take an input tax credit if such taxpayer receives a ‘qualified invoice’ from a seller that is registered as both (i) a consumption taxpayer and (ii) a qualified issuer (QII). Effectively, the new system will require sellers to include their QII number in invoices so that the purchaser receiving such invoice will be able to take the input credit for the consumption tax included in the invoice. The requirement is similar to that of a seller to include its VAT number on an invoice in the European context.
Businesses (other than exempt entities) must file an application with their tax office to become a QII in order to be able to issue qualified invoices.
Note that consumption tax is also imposed on the cross-border provision of digital services (e.g. e-books, music, and advertising) by foreign service providers. In this respect, a reverse-charge mechanism is applicable for business-to-business (B2B) transactions, and foreign service providers may need to register for consumption tax purposes with regard to business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions.
The platform taxation system was introduced under the 2024 Tax Reform Act, with the purpose of managing foreign service providers’ tax compliance. The provision of services subject to the platform taxation system includes B2C digital services rendered in Japan by foreign service providers via qualified platform operators, for which the payments from customers are received. Such services are deemed to have been provided by the qualified platform operators, who are then responsible for reporting and paying taxes on the provision of the services that are actually provided by the foreign service providers. When the total amount of the payments received from customers exceeds JPY 5 billion in the tax period of the platform operator, the NTA will designate such platform operator as a qualified platform operator.
Once a qualified platform operator has been designated, the NTA will publish on their website the name of the digital platform and other information of that qualified platform operator. In addition, the designated qualified platform operator shall notify the foreign service providers of this status.
## Customs duty

## Fixed assets tax
The annual fixed assets tax is levied by the local tax authorities on real property and depreciable fixed assets used for business purposes. Real property is taxed at 1.7% of the value appraised by the local tax authorities. The depreciable fixed assets tax is assessed at 1.4% of cost after statutory depreciation. The taxable basis of certain fixed assets acquired by 31 March 2025 by a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under an accredited plan will be reduced by one half or one third.
## Stamp duty
A stamp duty is levied on certain documents prepared in Japan. The tax amount is generally determined based on the amount stated in the document. The maximum amount of stamp duty is JPY 600,000.
## Registration and licence tax
Registration and licence tax is levied where certain property is registered, at a rate from 0.1% to 2% of the taxable basis or at a fixed amount (up to JPY 60,000). The taxable basis depends upon the property being registered (e.g. the amount of paid-in capital registered by a company or the value of real estate as assessed by local tax authorities).
## Payroll taxes
In general, the employer has an obligation to withhold payroll taxes monthly and for the annual year-end salary adjustment.
### Labour and social insurance paid by employer
There are four types of insurance systems in Japan that enterprises employing workers that meet certain conditions must enrol in. Workers’ accident compensation insurance is borne entirely by the employer. Employment insurance, health insurance/nursing care insurance, and employees’ pension insurance is born by both the employer and employee. The rate is revised annually. _For a breakdown of the employee’s share, please refer to the section in the Individual tax summary_.
The employer is generally liable to pay a share of the following contributions on salary or bonuses, including fringe benefits, to be paid in Japan. The employer’s share consists of the following contributions:
Contribution | Standard premiums on monthly salary | Standard premiums on bonuses  
---|---|---  
Health insurance for the Tokyo metropolitan area (each prefecture has its own health insurance rate, and rates are slightly higher for individuals between the ages of 40 and 64)* | 4.99% (on a maximum of JPY 1,390,000 of wages per month) from March 2024 | 4.99% (on an annual cap of JPY 5.73 million of irregular annual total payments) from March 2024  
Welfare pension, plus child allowance  | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 620,000 of wages per month) fixed rate | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 1.5 million of irregular payments per month) fixed rate  
Employment insurance | 0.95% from April 2024 | 0.95% from April 2024  
Total** | 15.09% | 15.09%  
* Premiums on child allowances will be imposed separately at 0.36%.** In addition, workers’ accident compensation insurance will be imposed. The rate varies depending on the type of business.
## Family corporation tax
If an individual shareholder together with family members own, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the total issued shares or voting rights of a Japanese corporation, the corporation is treated as a family corporation (with the exception of corporations with paid-in capital of JPY 100 million or less) and is subject to the family corporation tax in addition to corporation tax.
Family corporation tax is an additional tax at the rates shown in the table below, which is charged on a corporation’s undistributed current earnings in excess of specified limits calculated in the following formula.
Taxable undistributed current earnings = Undistributed current earnings – the permitted deduction*
* The deduction is the greater of (i) 40% of income, (ii) JPY 20 million, or (iii) 25% of the year-end capital amount – (capital reserve less current year’s increase in capital reserve)
Taxable undistributed current earnings | Family corporation tax rate (%)  
---|---  
First JPY 30 million _per annum_ | 10  
Next JPY 70 million _per annum_ | 15  
Over JPY 100 million _per annum_ | 20  
## Business premises tax
Business premises tax is levied and designated by each city in Japan, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and other cities with a population of more than 300,000. A corporation that uses business premises in excess of 1,000 square metres and/or has more than 100 employees in a designated city is responsible to pay this tax based on the physical footprint of the business (JPY 600 per square metre) and gross payroll (0.25% of gross payroll).
