# Hong Kong SAR
## Overview
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is located in Eastern Asia on the southeast coast of Chinese mainland. The official languages of Hong Kong SAR are Chinese and English, and the currency is the Hong Kong dollar (HKD). Hong Kong SAR continues to link its currency closely to the United States dollar (USD), maintaining an arrangement established in 1983.
Hong Kong was a self-governing British colony from 1841 to mid-1997. Pursuant to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong became a SAR of the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. According to the Basic Law (Hong Kong SAR's constitutional document), Hong Kong SAR is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defence affairs for the next 50 years after the sovereignty transfer under the 'one country, two systems' policy. The Basic Law ensures that Hong Kong SAR's legal system is separate from the one of Chinese mainland and remains within the common law system. The Hong Kong SAR Government is committed to upholding the rule of law, which has played a vital role in Hong Kong SAR's success in the past.
Hong Kong SAR is one of the freest economies in the world. Hong Kong SAR became a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in 1991 and a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 1 January 1995.
Over the past few decades, Hong Kong SAR has been transformed from a labour-intensive manufacturing-based economy towards a high value-added and knowledge-based economy, with focus on international trade, financial services, tourism, etc. Since the handover in 1997, Hong Kong SAR has become increasingly integrated with Chinese mainland through trade, tourism, and financial links. Hong Kong SAR has also established itself as the premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad and a prime renminbi (CNY) offshore centre.
