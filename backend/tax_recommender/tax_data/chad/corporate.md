## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
## Taxable period
Companies must, in principle, close off their yearly financial accounts on 31 December each year. Where a company begins operations later in the year (say June 2018), it has the option of operating for a minimum of 12 months or a maximum of 18 months to close off its accounts.
## Tax returns
Corporate tax returns are due on 30 April, at the latest, with the possibility to apply for an exceptional extension to 15 May.
Before fiscal year 2018, taxpayers could subscribe to a rectifying Statistical and Tax Statement at any time before any tax audit.
From fiscal year 2018, any taxpayer who has made errors or omissions in one’s spontaneous tax returns (monthly tax return, annual tax return, annual statement of salaries and wages) can subscribe to a rectificative tax return within two months from the date of filing of the initial tax return.
An amending declaration is binding to the tax administration if filed within two months.
## Payment of tax
Certain taxes are considered instalment payments of corporate tax. Once the amount of corporate tax is known, these payments are deductible from the amount and only the balance has to be paid on 15 May. These taxes include the minimum corporate tax, the quarterly instalment payments, and the 4% discharge for retail goods, if applicable.
### Minimum corporate tax (monthly and quarterly)
The minimum corporate tax shall be filed and paid, at the latest, on the 15th day of the month following the month of achievement of the turnover for companies subject to the normal tax regime and quarterly for companies subject to the simplified tax regime.
However, for the payment of the floor rate, payment may be made in four instalments of XAF 250,000 each, 15 days after the end of the quarter.
If this instalment payment exceeds the annual corporate tax, the remainder is lost.
### One-third instalment payments (paid three times quarterly)
Corporations that fulfil the following conditions are subject to quarterly instalment payments:
  * Liable to corporate tax. 
  * Made a profit during the prior fiscal year. 
  * The amount of the corporate tax of the prior fiscal year is superior to at least XAF 100,000. 


The quarterly instalment payments are equal to one-third of the difference between the corporate tax due during the prior fiscal year and the minimum income tax paid during the same period.
The payment must take place before the 15th day of May, August, and November.
Since August 2017, taxpayers are authorised to pay taxes, penalties, and fines by electronic money. The tax administration has not yet precised the modalities of payment.
## Tax audit process
In brief, the tax audit exercised by the _Direction Générale des Impôts_ (Directorate General of Taxes) in Chad consists of three different types of control:
  * Audit of monthly, quarterly, and annual tax returns, which requires no prior notice by the tax administration to the taxpayer. 
  * Spot checks, which are done on one or more taxes on a group of operations over a period of less than one fiscal year. Prior notice is obligatorily given by the tax administration to the taxpayer. 
  * General verification, which is the most important audit and needs prior notice by the tax administration to the taxpayer. This type also involves the other two audits aforementioned, so that the taxpayer can perform the necessary adjustments on previous declarations. 


In all the audits, there are contradictory and contentious proceedings. The contradictory proceeding is engaged when the tax administration finds deficiency, inaccuracy, or omission in the information on the tax returns and notifies the taxpayer thereof. The contentious proceeding, on the other hand, is engaged when the taxpayer, in turn, disagrees with the observations of the tax administration and challenges its position directly with the tax administration and/or with the courts.
### Contentious claim
Taxpayers who dispute the justification or the amount of tax levied on them may, if they had formally filed the claim under certain conditions, obtain stay of payment of the disputed portion of the said taxes, on condition that they:
  * expressly request respite of payment in the complaint 
  * state the amount or the basis of the tax relief requested 
  * provide supporting documents showing payment of the undisputed portion of the tax and 15% of the disputed one, and 
  * provide the bank guarantee obtained from a bank located in Chad. 


## Statute of limitations
The total or partial omissions found in the tax base, the inadequacies and inaccuracies, or the taxation errors, can be repaired by the tax administration until the end of the third year following that in which the tax or fee is payable.
Furthermore, any omission or insufficiency of tax revealed by a proceeding before the criminal courts or by a contentious claim may, without prejudice to the general period of repetitions established above, be repaired until the end of the third year following the revelation of the facts.
## Validation of the taxpayer’s accounts: Competence of Chartered Accountants CEMAC
Before 2018, the certification of the taxpayer’s accounts made by an accountant or chartered accountant, accredited to the Court of Appeal of N'Djamena or approved CEMAC, is binding to the tax administration.
From fiscal year 2018, only CEMAC chartered accountant are authorised to validate the taxpayer’s accounts.
### Applicable sanctions
Fine applicable to the taxpayer: Fine of XAF 300,000 if the taxpayer’s account is validated by an accountant or chartered accountant of the Court of Appeal of N'Djamena.
Fines of XAF 5 million are applicable to any accountant who validates an accounting that is inconclusive or tainted by irregularities.
Furthermore, a suspension of approval for two years and criminal prosecution are applicable.
## Prohibition of chartered accountants to provide tax advice
From 2018, any accountant who provides tax advice in contradiction to the texts that govern its profession is liable to a fine of XAF 5 million, the suspension of its authorisation for two years, and criminal prosecution.
There is an incompatibility of the practice of the profession of chartered accountant with the profession of tax advisory as defined by the Statute of Tax Council.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
  * Foreign technical assistance fees. 
  * WHT on non-commercial profit. 
  * Stock variation. 
  * VAT on provision of foreign services.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
Expenses are deductible under the following conditions:
  * They must lead to a reduction of the assets. 
  * They must be incurred in the interest of the enterprise. 
  * They must be regularly included in the accounts of the entity and justified by receipts. 
  * They must be related to the fiscal year within which they are incurred. 
  * They must not be considered as non-deductible by the law. 


## Depreciation
According to accountancy principles, depreciation is calculated based on the probable length of use of the asset. The straight-line system of depreciation is applicable, and rates vary according to the nature of the business activity concerned and the normal useful life of the assets involved.
From an accountancy point of view, it is possible to depreciate whatever amount corresponds to the above-mentioned principles. However, from a tax point of view, depreciation (i.e. enabling a deduction of the depreciated amount from the taxable income) is only possible under the condition that the depreciation has been entered into the statement of accounts. Therefore, only a legal entity in Chad owning the assets is able to depreciate its assets. In addition, if depreciation in the statement of accounts is higher than the depreciation authorised, the difference is not deductible and has to be reinstated in the taxable income.
The starting point for depreciation is the day of first use. If this date is not the first day of the financial year, the first year’s depreciation is reduced pro-rata.
It should be noted that, despite the above, goods that are leased are depreciated at the rate that they are paid for.
Depreciation of goods that are made available for free to managers and supervisors of the business are deductible if the corresponding benefit in kind is declared.
The sum of depreciation applied to the acquisition or creation of an asset cannot, at the end of each financial year, be less than the amount of depreciation calculated on the linear system and spread out over the normal usage period.
Depreciation in loss-making years may be carried forward to the first profitable financial year, and to subsequent years if necessary.
## Major repairs
The major repairs carried out by a company on the assets listed in the balance sheet are only deductible by way of depreciation.
## Goodwill
There are no provisions for goodwill as regards deduction of expenses.
## Start-up expenses
There are no provisions for start-up expenses.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid for the depositing of funds by a shareholder is deductible within the base rate of the central bank plus two points, calculated on the basis of the share capital.
However, interest paid to a foreign related entity is deductible up to 10% of the tax intermediary result of the Chadian debtor.
In the event that the beneficiary of these interests is located in a tax haven, the deduction is limited to 50% of the gross amount without prejudice of the application of the limitation of 10% mentioned above.
## Bad debt
Provisions for credit customers are deductible if judicial actions have been taken for the recovery of the said debt.
## Charitable contributions
Donations and liberalities are deductible within a 0.5% limit of the annual turnover, net of tax, when they are duly justified. However, a decision from the Minister of Finances is required.
## Fines and penalties
Tax and customs penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible.
### Structural VAT credits
Structural VAT credits are deductible if the following conditions are met:
  * The company justifies the origin of the VAT credits by producing the statement of the deductible VAT accompanied by the original invoices and the receipts of the customs. 
  * An attestation of VAT credit, signed by the General Tax Director, is produced. 


## Other significant items
The following expenses are not deductible:
  * Provisions for laying off employees. 
  * Provisions for self-insurance. 
  * Insurance premiums paid for a third-party. 


The following expenses are not fully deductible:
  * Foreign social security contributions are deductible only within 15% of the base salary of the expatriates when related to a compulsory retirement plan. Nonetheless, Chad’s social security contributions are fully deductible. 
  * Restaurants, hotels, receptions, and related costs are deductible within a 0.5% limit of the turnover, net of tax. 
  * Travel expenses for expatriates and their families for vacation are deductible, limited to one trip per year. 


## Net operating losses
Losses arising from normal business activities of the company are deductible and may be carried forward for up to three years. Carryback of losses is not permitted.
## Payments to foreign affiliates (foreign technical assistance and administrative fees)
There is a specific regulation relating to foreign general administrative and technical assistance costs, which are subject to a 10% limitation of deductibility. The scope of the 10% limitation covers study expenses, technical assistance, and other expenses, including commercial and industrial royalties and interests, paid to the head office of an enterprise established outside Chad and outside the CEMAC zone.
These costs are only deductible within 10% of the intermediary fiscal profit (accounting profits plus non-allowable charges/costs) prior to their deduction if the following conditions are met:
  * The details of these general administrative and technical assistance costs shall be annexed to Table 22 of the annual tax returns (_Déclaration Statistique et Fiscale_ or DSF). 
  * The details shall present the amounts paid according to the activities’ sectors and countries where the company carries out its activities. 


However, from fiscal year 2018, foreign technical assistance fees or administrative fees paid to beneficiaries located in a tax haven are deductible up to 50% of their gross amount without prejudice to the limit of 10%.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 12 August 2024
There is a specific taxation of groups within the CEMAC area.
Where a joint stock company and a private limited company own either registered stock in a joint stock company or shares in a private limited company, the net proceeds of the share in the second company paid to the first during the financial year shall be deducted from the total net profit of the latter, less a percentage for costs and charges. This percentage is fixed at 10% of the total amount of the proceeds. This system shall apply when all of the following conditions are met:
  * The stocks or shares owned by the parent establishment represent at least 50% of the capital of the subsidiary firm.
  * The parent and subsidiary firms have their registered office in a CEMAC state (i.e. Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Republic of Congo).
  * The stocks or shares allotted at the time of issue are still registered in the name of the participating company that undertakes to retain them for at least two consecutive years in registered form.


## Transfer pricing
The Tax Code acknowledges that dependent or controlled companies may transfer benefits indirectly to their company abroad it is dependent on or to the company abroad it is controlled by.
In order to calculate the real benefit, the indirectly transferred benefits (by means of increase of purchase price or decrease of sales price to the controlling company or by any other means) are incorporated into the result established by the accounts.
If the tax administration does not have enough precise elements to determine the benefit, it will establish the taxable benefit by way of comparison to companies normally operated in Chad.
The Tax Code provides further, in accordance with CEMAC regulation, that interest paid to shareholders on sums that they lend over and above their share capital is deductible at the rate for loans allowed by the central bank increased by two percentage points. This deduction is only possible if the amounts lent do not exceed 50% of the share capital.
### Transfer pricing documentation requirements
From January 2023, Article 1000 XIV of the General Tax Code requires a category of taxpayers who are resident in Chad to submit spontaneously and annually to the tax authorities, during the filing of the fiscal and statistic declaration, a light transfer pricing documentation (LTPD) together with the full transfer pricing documentation (FTPD). The LTPD is to be filled in a form by the concerned taxpayers, while the FTPD is a documentation containing all the required information.
For 2023, both the LTPD and the FTPD must be filed by 1 May 2023 (30 April being a Sunday). However, a deadline submission extension can be granted by the tax administration without exceeding two months.
Companies concerned by the LTPD and the FTPD are enterprises registered in Chad:
  * having an annual turnover before tax or gross assets on the balance sheet equal to or greater than XAF 500,000,000
  * being under the dependence of or having control over companies located outside of Chad, or
  * making transfers with companies established in a territory with a privileged tax regime.


By reference to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations, and the Circular ref 02 /MFBCP/SE/SG/DGI/ 2023, an FTPD should includen especially:
  * a general presentation of the group and the Chadian company
  * an industrial analysis
  * a description of audited transactions
  * a functional analysis
  * a financial analysis
  * a presentation and selection of transfer pricing methods, and
  * an economic analysis.


Branches and PEs are within the scope of the said requirement.
Late filing of the transfer pricing documentation is subject to fines as follows:
  * XAF 10 million for the first month late.
  * XAF 20 million for the second month late.
  * XAF 25 million for the third month late.
  * XAF 5 million per month late for the months following the third month.


Lack of filing the transfer pricing documentation entails the non-deductibility of expenses relating to intra-group transactions (i.e. foreign technical assistance, management fees, royalties, interest) and the payment of fines amounting to 5% of the amount of intra-group transactions with a minimum of XAF 50 million.
Moreover, the lack of filing, late filing, and insufficiency of information required for transfer pricing documentation leads to the payment of a fine of XAF 100,000 per each piece of information not provided, each piece of missing information, and each piece of inaccurate information.
## Thin capitalisation
The thin capitalisation rules apply to companies subject to corporate tax and to advance of funds or receivables granted by shareholders.
The deductibility of interest paid to shareholders is limited by two rules:
  * Interest rate limitation: Interest incurred on advances of funds granted by all shareholders is tax deductible up to the rate of the Central Africa Community Bank plus 2.
  * Equity ratio: The amount of advance of funds does not exceed 1.5 times the equity. This equity ratio applies only to shareholders that control the management of the entity.


## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions relating to CFCs in Chad.

## Customs duties
The tax basis of customs duties corresponds with the customs valuation, namely the selling price of the goods plus cost of delivery to Chad (costs of insurance, transportation, etc.).
The rates of customs duties depend on the nature of the goods and range from 5% to 30%. These rates can be summarised as follows:
  * Goods of first need (basic necessities): 5%.
  * Raw materials and goods of equipment: 10%.
  * Intermediate and miscellaneous goods: 20%.
  * Consumer goods: 30%.


## Excise duty
Excise duty applies to goods of great consumption: cigarettes, drinks (water, beer, and wine), cosmetics, and luxury products, and transactions of mobile companies, which are the legal taxpayers. Excise duty rates depend on the nature of the goods and range from 5% to 25% of the value of the good.
Some of the rates are as follows:
  * Water: 5%.
  * Beer and wine: 25%.
  * Perfume, jewellery, electronic devices (except computers, telephones etc.), private vehicles with an engine capacity above 1600 cm³, and weapons: 20%.
  * Compound alcoholic preparations: 25%.
  * Tobacco (all types): 25%.
  * Turnover of mobile companies (legal taxpayers) realised on their transactions: 18%.


This value differs depending on the origin of the good. If the good has been manufactured in the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) zone, the value corresponds with the selling price charged by the manufacturer. If the good is imported into the CEMAC zone, the value is the sum of the freight value plus insurance costs and customs duties.
This value constitutes the basis of the calculations of the excise duty.
## Real property tax
The annual real property tax differs according to whether it is a built or an unbuilt property and whether it is located in N’Djamena or elsewhere. The tax is imposed in the municipality where the property is situated.
The tax rate on built property is 10% in N’Djamena and 8% elsewhere.
The tax rate on unbuilt property is 21% in N’Djamena and 20% elsewhere.
The calculation basis is the potential revenue of that property. The potential revenues correspond to four-fifths of the rental value, the rental value being 10% of the market value. For rural unbuilt property, the market value is fixed to XAF 50,000 per hectare.
Some temporary exemptions are granted to new buildings or additions to constructed buildings after 1 January 1968 from this tax in some conditions. In case of construction or reconstruction, owners can benefit from temporary exemptions as follows:
  * If the villa is owned by a corporation: 2 years.
  * If the villa belongs to an individual and put on rental: 2 years.
  * If the villa is built or rebuilt for commercial and industrial use: 2 years.
  * New construction or reconstruction and additions to buildings for a holiday resort, for approval (accreditation), or for furnished rent are excluded.
