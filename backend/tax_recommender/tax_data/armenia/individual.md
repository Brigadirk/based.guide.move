From 1 July 2018, all employees, notaries, and individual entrepreneurs born after 1 January 1974 should make funded pension contributions. 
Starting from 1 January 2023, the maximum threshold for the calculation of the pension contribution is AMD 1,125,000 Armenia dram (AMD) (15 times the minimum monthly salary of AMD 75,000). Please note that from 1 January 2023 the minimum monthly salary is increased from AMD 68,000 to AMD 75,000.
From 1 January 2023, the pension contribution payment will be calculated as follows:
