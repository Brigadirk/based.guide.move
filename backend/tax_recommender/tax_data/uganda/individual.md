## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
An individual is entitled to a foreign tax credit for any foreign income tax suffered on foreign-source income. This credit is granted if the same income that has already suffered foreign tax is included in the chargeable income of the individual for purposes of Uganda tax. However, the relief granted cannot exceed the amount of Uganda tax that the income would have suffered.
This calculation is made separately for foreign income arising from business sources and for foreign income arising from other sources.
## Tax treaties
Uganda has double taxation agreements (DTAs) with the following countries:
  * Denmark
  * India
  * Italy
  * Mauritius
  * Netherlands
  * Norway

---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 4,020,000 | - | 10  
4,020,001 | 4,920,000 | 402,000 | 20

120,000,001 | 35,106,000 | 40  
## Rental tax
The tax rate applicable to an individual for the purposes of rental income is 12% of annual gross rental income in excess of UGX 2,820,000.
In determining the chargeable income of an individual, the individual is not entitled to deduct any expenses against rental income.
## Withholding taxes (WHTs)
As in the case for corporations, individuals that are employers are also obligated to withhold tax on payments of employment income made to their employees. This is a final tax for an individual who does not have other sources of income.
Individuals also incur WHT on payments of interest made to them. The WHT is at a rate of 15%. However, individuals are not obligated to withhold tax on payments made by them to taxable persons.
WHT is also incurred at a rate of 15% on dividends received by individuals. However, if the dividend is received from a listed company, the WHT incurred is 10%.
WHT is also charged on the importation of goods into the country. The tax charged is at a rate of 6% on the value of goods imported. Individuals are required to maintain records of the WHT paid on imported goods. 
Tax at 6% is also deducted on receipt of payment from the government of Uganda, a government institution, a local government, or designated withholding agents for supplies exceeding UGX 1 million.
Tax credits are available for the WHT suffered. However, tax suffered on interest from government securities is a final tax. Such interest is therefore not included in the chargeable income of the individual and no tax credits are granted on it.

## Tax returns
All taxpayers are obligated to file a return within six months of the end of the year of income. Where an individual is in business, one is expected to file the return accompanied by a statement of income and expenditure and a statement of assets and liabilities.
However, no return of income is required from a non-resident or resident individual where their income consists exclusively of income derived from a single employer from which tax has been withheld by the employer as required by the law.
A return is also not required for a non-resident individual whose tax obligation has fully been satisfied through the withholding of tax by withholding agents.
A return is also not required from a resident individual whose chargeable income falls in the zero rated threshold of tax.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers receiving or expecting to receive income in a year of income that is not subject to any WHT at source are expected to pay provisional tax.
Individuals that are obligated to pay provisional tax as explained above are expected to pay four instalments of tax before the last day of the third month, sixth month, ninth month, and 12th month of the year of income. Each instalment is 25% of the individual's estimate of tax due for that year.
_As explained in the section_ , the provisional tax paid is granted as a tax credit against the income tax assessed at the end of the year of income. Excess tax paid can be refunded or offset against other liabilities.
