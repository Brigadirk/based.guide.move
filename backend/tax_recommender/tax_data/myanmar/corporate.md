Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The taxable period of a company is the same as its financial year (income year). Income earned during the financial year is assessed to tax in the assessment year, which is the year following the financial year.
Prior to the financial year 2018/19, the fiscal year was from 1 April to 31 March. The financial period of 31 March year-end was changed to 30 September from the financial year 2018/19 (i.e. from 1 October 2018) for state-owned enterprises and financial institutions and from the financial year 2019/20 (i.e. from 1 October 2019) for all other taxpayers.
The financial year-end of 30 September has changed to 31 March again, starting from 1 October 2021.
## Tax returns
In general, annual income tax returns must be filed within three months from the end of the financial year.
Tax returns for capital gains must be filed within 30 days from the date of disposal of the capital assets.
If a taxpayer discontinues one’s business, returns must be filed within one month from the date of discontinuance of business.
The failure of a taxpayer to file income tax returns, knowing that assessable income has been obtained, is deemed to have ‘fraudulent intention’.
## Payment of tax
Advance corporate tax payments are made in quarterly instalments within ten days from the end of the relevant quarter throughout the income tax year based on the estimated total income for the year. The advance payments and any taxes withheld are creditable against the final tax liability. The date for settling the final tax liability is within 21 days from the date of notice issued by the IRD.
Previously, resident companies had to pay taxes in Myanmar kyats, while non-residents companies that earned income in foreign currency had to pay taxes in earned foreign currency. However, with effect from 1 April 2024, there is no distinction between residents and non-residents for tax payment currency, and both resident and non-resident companies must pay taxes based on the currency in which the income was earned or received.
Capital gains tax needs to be paid within 30 days from the date of disposal of capital assets.
## Tax audit process
Under the Myanmar Income Tax Law, if it is found that there is a fraudulent intention to evade tax, the assessment or reassessment of income tax can be made at any time on the income that has escaped assessment of tax.
Failure by a taxpayer to file a return of income knowing that assessable income has been obtained, failure to comply with the notice of the IRD to submit accounts and documents, including the tax return and profit and loss accounts within the time prescribed, or submitting forged instruments and other documents are included within the meaning of fraudulent intention. If the tax authority in the course of investigation finds that a taxpayer has concealed income or particulars relating to income, the taxpayer may be permitted to fully disclose the facts within the specified time. In addition, the taxpayer must pay a penalty equal to 100% of the tax increased on account of the concealment. If the taxpayer fails to disclose the particulars within the specified time or discloses less than the income concealed, the taxpayer will also be subject to prosecution, in addition to paying the tax and penalty. If the taxpayer is found guilty, the taxpayer may be punishable with imprisonment for between three to ten years.
Under the new TAL that shall be effective from 1 October 2019, the penalties for concealing or providing incorrect information and tax evasion will change as follows:
  * Concealing or providing incorrect information: 
    * MMK 150,000 and the higher of: 
      * the difference between the correct tax due and the tax assessed, or
      * the difference between the correct amount of refund and the refund made.
    * If it is reasonable to assume that the person must not have known that it is incorrect or misleading, no penalty shall be imposed.
  * Tax evasion cases: 
    * seven years of imprisonment
    * the higher of MMK 250,000 and 100% of the tax amount evaded, or
    * both of the above.


## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation to raise an assessment is three years after the financial year-end. It does not apply in cases of fraudulent default. Mere filing of the income tax return and payment of advance tax in time does not constitute a final tax assessment.
Under the TAL 2019, with effect from 1 October 2019, the statute of limitation of three years has increased to six years. The Director General of the Internal Revenue Department can conduct an assessment or re-assessment of the taxpayer within a period of six years after the end of the relevant assessment year. In relation to intentional negligence or fraudulent cases, the infinite statute of limitation was replaced with a 12-years period.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The following issues are currently being focused on by the tax authorities:
  * Tax payment to be made in the foreign currency that the income is denominated.
  * Timely filing of tax returns and payment of taxes (i.e. corporate tax, commercial tax, capital gains tax, employer tax, specific goods tax, etc.).
  * Exchange rates used in translating foreign currencies to the local currency for claims of tax deduction, tax depreciation, and for tax payment purposes.
  * Completeness of records maintained by taxpayers to verify income and claims for deductions.
  * Tax deduction of donations for corporate tax purposes.
  * WHT compliance on both domestic and cross-border transactions.
  * The requirement of obtaining advance approval from the tax authorities before the claim of tax treaty benefits/rates.
  * Stamp duty compliance (i.e. the application of the duty rates and timeliness of payment).
  * Related-party transactions (e.g. payment of management fee to head office, shareholder loans).

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
A resident company is a company as defined and formed under the Myanmar CA or any other existing law of Myanmar.
A non-resident company is one that is not formed under the Myanmar CA or any other existing law of Myanmar. Generally, foreign branches registered in Myanmar are deemed to be non-resident companies.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Currently, there is no definition of a PE under the Myanmar Income Tax Act. Under the Myanmar Income Tax Act, the Myanmar tax authorities are empowered to collect income tax from a non-resident foreigner on its income sourced within Myanmar. In current practice, the Myanmar tax authorities seek to collect taxes from a non-resident foreigner on its income received from Myanmar by way of a withholding tax (WHT) mechanism, regardless of whether the foreigner has a PE or taxable presence in Myanmar or not. The term ‘PE’ may be defined in the tax treaties that Myanmar has with other countries. Subject to the relevant tax treaty, a foreigner who is tax resident of the treaty country may not be subject to Myanmar taxes if it does not have a PE in Myanmar.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
In respect of business income, deductions are allowed for expenditure incurred for the purpose of earning income.
Non-deductible items include capital expenditure, personal expenditure, expenditure that is not commensurate with the volume of business, irrelevant expenses and expenses incurred not for production of income, payments made to any member of an association of persons other than a company or a cooperative society, and inappropriate expenditure.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Income from movable property is considered as business income, and depreciation allowance for the cost of such movable property can be deducted. Income from immovable property is generally computed in the same way as business income, except that no depreciation allowance can be deducted.
Technically, a taxpayer entity is required to claim tax depreciation on the qualifying assets used for its business purposes based on rates prescribed under the Myanmar Income Tax Law, using a prescribed tax depreciation claim form. A taxpayer is entitled to full-year tax depreciation in the year the asset is acquired. On the other hand, no tax depreciation is allowed in the year the asset is disposed of.
The tax depreciation rates of fixed assets, as prescribed under the Income Tax Regulations, are as follows:
  * Buildings: 1.25% to 10%.
  * Furniture and fittings installed in buildings: 5% to 10%.
  * Machinery and plant: 2.5% to 20%.
  * Various kinds of vehicles: 12.5% to 20%.
  * Any fixed assets that are not prescribed: 5%.


## Goodwill
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of goodwill. Generally, goodwill is regarded as capital of nature and is not deductible for corporate tax purposes.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of start-up expenses. Generally, any operating expenses incurred before the commencement of business are not tax deductible. Myanmar tax authorities view pre-commencement expenses as capital in nature and not deductible for tax purposes. Capital expenditures incurred prior to the commencement of business should be allowed for tax depreciation where they relate to qualifying fixed assets.
## Interest expenses
There is currently no specific provision in the Myanmar Income Tax Law indicating the tax treatment of interest expenses. In current practice, interest expenses and the related financing costs are likely deductible only in the year these expenses are incurred, provided that the interest expenses incurred are meeting the tax deductibility rules above and commensurate with the volume of business or benefits that the taxpayer received.
## Bad debt
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of bad debt.
## Charitable contributions
Deductible charitable donations are limited to those made to the approved charitable organisations/activities and are subject to an overall limitation of 25% of total income.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are generally not deductible as they are not incurred in the production of business income.
## Taxes
There is no specific provision under the current Myanmar Income Tax Law governing the tax deductibility of taxes paid.
## Net operating losses
### Ordinary losses
Losses from any source may be set off against income accruing from any other sources in that year, except where the loss is from capital assets or a share of loss from an association of persons. Losses that are not fully deducted in a year can be carried forward and set off against profits in the next three consecutive years.
There is no provision for the carrying back of losses.
### Capital losses
Capital losses and a share of loss from an association of persons cannot be set off against income from other sources or carried forward.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Myanmar corporation can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to affiliates, provided that these payments are commensurate with the volume of business.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
There is no group taxation regime in Myanmar.
## Transfer pricing regime
There are currently no transfer pricing rules in Myanmar.
## Thin capitalisation rules
Generally, there is currently no specific safe harbour with respect to a debt-to-equity ratio for Myanmar tax purposes. The Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) has set a maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 (as part of the criteria for a Myanmar entity to obtain a foreign loan).
## Controlled foreign company (CFC) regime
There are currently no CFC rules in Myanmar.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Generally, foreign branches are deemed to be non-resident companies. Non-resident companies are taxed only on income derived from sources within Myanmar. Non-resident companies pay tax at the same rate as resident companies. This means a branch of a foreign company will pay tax at the 22% rate. The income is generally subject to tax under the normal rules for residents.

Any person making the following payments is required to withhold income tax at the time of payment at the rates listed below. The tax withheld must be paid to the Internal Revenue Department (IRD) within 15 days from the date of withholding.
Tax withheld from payments to residents (and branches registered in Myanmar) will be set off against the tax due on their final assessments. Tax withheld from payments to non-resident companies (except the branches registered in Myanmar) is a final tax.
The application of certain tax treaty rates/exemptions may be at the discretion of the IRD in current practice.
For payments made by state organisations, state enterprises, development committees, co-operative societies, foreign companies, foreign enterprises and organisations, local companies, and under an existing law for purchase of goods, work performed, or supply of services within the country under a tender, contract, quotation, or other modes, the WHT rate is 2% if the payment is made to a resident and 2.5% if it is made to a non-resident.

Foreign investors may register their companies under the Myanmar Companies Act (CA) or in conjunction with the Myanmar Investment Law (MIL) or Myanmar Special Economic Zone Law (Myanmar SEZ Law). The new MIL 2016 was enacted on 18 October 2016. The new MIL is a consolidation of the Myanmar Citizen Investment Law (2013) and the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (MFIL) (2012). The Myanmar Citizen Investment Law and MFIL have been repealed with effect from 18 October 2016. New rules governing the implementation of the new MIL were enacted on 30 March 2017.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
There is no VAT in Myanmar.
## Commercial tax
Commercial tax, at rates ranging from 0% to 15%, is levied as a turnover tax on goods and services. Generally, commercial tax is imposed at the rate of 5%. The commercial tax that a business charges and collects is known as output tax, which has to be paid to the Myanmar tax authorities. Commercial tax incurred on business purchases and expenses are known as input tax. Businesses that are registered for commercial tax can claim commercial input tax if certain conditions are satisfied.
Commercial tax is imposed on a wide range of specified goods and services traded, produced, or rendered within the country, based on the sales proceeds, and on imported goods (_see Customs duties below for details_). There are 47 types of goods exempted from commercial tax.
Most services are subject to 5% commercial tax, except for the services below:
  * 15% commercial tax on the income earned from Internet services and a one-time commercial tax of 20,000 Myanmar kyats (MMK) on the sale of new mobile phone SIM cards upon activation.
  * 3% commercial tax on the sale proceeds from construction, repair, and sale of infrastructure for a long-term lease of state-owned land or in cooperation with the state or in the private-owned land or in cooperation with the landowner. 
  * 3% commercial tax on the receipt of hotel and tourism services. 
  * 1% commercial tax on the sales proceeds from the sale of gold or jewellery or on the landed costs in case of imports from abroad.


There are also 34 types of services that are specifically exempt from commercial tax (e.g. life insurance, banking and financial services that are operated with the permission of the Central Bank of Myanmar, microfinance, public transportation, publishing services). 
No commercial tax is imposed if the proceeds from production and sales of goods, receipts from services, or proceeds from trading for a financial year are not more than MMK 50 million.
Commercial tax is zero-rated on all exports, except for electricity (8%) and crude oil (5%).
The Ministry of Planning and Finance, with the approval from the Union Government Cabinet, may grant relief or exemption from commercial tax in respect of activities carried out with donations or assistance of loans from domestic or foreign organisations.
Companies registered under the MIC/SEZ may, at the discretion of the MIC/SEZ Committee, be granted exemption from commercial tax during certain stipulated periods (_see the section for details_).
## Specific goods tax
The Specific Goods Tax Law replaces commercial tax on a list of specific goods that are imported into Myanmar, manufactured in Myanmar, or exported to a foreign country. The list of specific goods include cigarettes, tobacco leaves, virginia leaves, cheroots, cigars, pipe tobaccos, and betel-chewing tobacco; beers, wine, and alcoholic beverages; wood logs and wood cuttings; vans, saloons, sedans and estate wagons, and coupe cars except double cab 4-door pickups from the range of 1501 cc to 4001 cc and above; and kerosene, petrol, diesel, and aviation jet fuel, as well as natural gas. The specific goods tax rates range from 5% to 80%.
Specific goods tax is exempted on all exports, except for wood logs and wood cuttings, which are subject to tax at 10%.
Under the Specific Goods Tax Law, only a manufacturer of special goods can claim and offset the specific goods tax incurred on purchase of raw materials/semi-finished goods against the specific goods tax charged on sale of specific goods.
On top of specific goods tax, commercial tax of 5% will also be imposed.
Companies registered under the MIC/SEZ may, at the discretion of the MIC/SEZ Committee, be granted exemption from internal taxes, which may cover specific goods tax, during certain stipulated periods (_see the section for details_).
## Gems tax
Under the Union Taxation Law (UTL) 2023, gemstones (whether it is rough or cut or jewellery or things made with gemstones) shall be subject to gems tax in accordance with Section 38 of the Myanmar Gemstone Law 2019. The tax rates are ranging from 5% to 11%.
## Customs duties
Customs duty was previously levied under the Customs Tariff of Myanmar (2017). The Myanmar Customs Tariff 2022 is now applied starting from 1st October 2022 at rates of up to 60%.
Companies registered under the MIC/SEZ may, at the discretion of the MIC/SEZ Committee, be granted exemption from customs duties during certain stipulated periods (_see the section for details_).
## Excise duties
Excise duty is levied on alcoholic drinks and is collected by the General Administration Department under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
## Property taxes
Immovable property (land and buildings) in Myanmar is subject to property tax.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duty is levied on various types of instruments, and some rates are given below:
  * 2% of the amount or value of the consideration for conveyances of properties, for the sale or transfer of immovable property. Immovable properties located in Nay Pyi Taw, Yangon, and Mandalay are subject to an additional 2% of stamp duty on the consideration equal to the market value of the properties.
  * 0.1% of share value for the transfer of shares.
  * 0.5% of the amount or value secured for bonds.
  * 0.5% of the annual value of rent for immovable properties lease agreements between one and three years, and 2% of the average annual value of rent where the term of the lease agreement is more than three years. 2% stamp duty will also be applicable on lease premium.


## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains tax is levied on gains from the sale, exchange, or transfer of capital assets (i.e. any land, building, vehicle, and any capital assets of an enterprise, which include shares, bonds, and similar instruments).
Capital gains from the sale, exchange, or transfer of capital assets in the oil and gas sector (companies engaged in upstream oil and gas activities relating to exploration, drilling, and extraction) are taxed at different rates from those in other sectors.
Type of taxpayer | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Resident companies | 10  
Non-resident companies | 10  
Transfer of shares in companies engaged in upstream oil and gas activities relating to exploration, drilling, and extraction or interest in production sharing contracts | 40 to 50  
Tax returns for capital gains must be filed within 30 days from the date of disposal of the capital assets. Capital gains tax payments are required to be made within 30 days from the date of disposal of the capital assets. Previously, resident taxpayers paid capital gains tax and other income tax in kyats, irrespective of whether they had foreign currency income. Now, resident taxpayers must pay tax in the type of currency received, in the same manner as non-resident taxpayers always had to.
## Registration taxes
There is a registration fee of MMK 150,000 payable to the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration for setting up a private company or a branch in Myanmar. In addition to the registration fee, there may be other administrative expenses or stamp duty payable on the company’s constitution.
## Payroll taxes
An employer is responsible for deducting income tax due from salaries at the time of payment to employees and must pay the amount within 15 days from the date of deduction. If the employer fails to deduct and pay the tax, the employer is deemed to be a defaulter and held responsible for such payment. In addition, the employer is also responsible for filing the statement of annual salary within three months after the end of the income year, and failure to file by the stipulated deadline may result in a penalty of 10% of the amount of tax to be deducted on annual salaries.
## Social security contributions
An employer with five or more employees is required to provide Social Security Scheme benefits to those workers, such as health and social care insurance and insurance against employment-related injuries.
The rates of contribution by employees and employers are 2% and 3% of the total salaries and wages, respectively. The contribution must be made in Myanmar kyats for all currencies that the salaries are paid in within 15 days of the following month, using the exchange rate prescribed by the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) on the first day of the relevant month.
The maximum contribution is limited to MMK 9,000 by the employer and MMK 6,000 by the employee.
Contributions made by the employees are deductible for tax purposes in the hands of the employees. The employer is obligated to withhold the employees’ contributions from their salaries.
