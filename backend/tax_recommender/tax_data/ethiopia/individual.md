  * the foreign income tax paid, or
  * the employment income tax payable in respect of the foreign employment income calculated by applying the average rate of employment income tax applicable to the resident employee to the foreign employment income of the employee for the month.


## Tax treaties
Ethiopia has DTTs with the following countries: Cyprus, Egypt, France, Great Britain and North Ireland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Turkey.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
In Ethiopia, individuals are taxed on income that is sourced from Ethiopia, wherever paid. An individual is either taxed as a resident or a non-resident.
Ethiopian resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed on their Ethiopian-sourced income. The same rates of tax are applicable to both residents and non-residents.
The taxable income of a person for any year is the total of that person's income for the year less the total amount of deductions allowed to that person. Taxable income comprises the following: employment income, business profits, and investment income.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year in Ethiopia runs from 8 July to 7 July.
## Tax returns
Individuals who receive employment income only are not required to file personal income tax returns. Instead, employers must withhold PAYE taxes from each payment to an employee and remit the payment to the tax authorities based on the amount withheld during each calendar month.
## Payment of tax
PAYE taxes should be paid by the end of the month following the month the income was earned (i.e. the month for which the payment/income relates to).
In Ethiopia, the calendar year runs on a slightly different basis. For example, statutory payments due for the month of December 2020 would be due at the end of the following month. In Ethiopia, the end of the following month is equivalent to 7 or 8 February (as opposed to 31 January) since the Ethiopian calendar has a time lag of 7 to 8 days.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitation in Ethiopia for taxes is five years from the date that the tax declaration for the tax period to which they relate was filed with the tax authority.

## Individual - Other issues
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Exchange controls
The National Bank of Ethiopia regulates the entry and remittance of foreign currencies in Ethiopia through specific directives applicable to both Ethiopians and foreigners. The directives govern the flow of foreign exchange. Virtually all outgoing and some incoming foreign currencies (such as foreign loans) are regulated.
Expatriates employed in Ethiopia may remit, in convertible foreign currency, salaries and other payments accruing from their employment in accordance with the foreign exchange laws of the country.
## Expatriate issues
Where an expatriate employee is assigned to Ethiopia and the employer does not have a presence in Ethiopia, the employee can opt to register for taxes and comply through the self-withholding tax regime.
Under the self-withholding regime, the employee will be required to submit quarterly returns and remit the PAYE on a quarterly basis.
Foreign nationals are not permitted to contribute to social security in Ethiopia.
## Temporary visas
A business visa must be applied for via the Embassy in one’s home country and must be in place before arrival into Addis Ababa.
It is possible to travel on a business visa and convert it into a work permit.
## Work permits
Foreigners can work in Ethiopia provided that they have obtained a work permit. A work permit is issued for three years but must be renewed every year.
## Tax equalisation
Where an individual is tax equalised whilst on assignment, this generally means that the employer is responsible for the host country taxes and any host country refunds would also be due to the employer.
The individual would only be responsible for the hypothetical taxes that would have been paid on their income had they remained in their home country (and not gone on assignment). As such, it is likely that they would be on a guaranteed net package such that once the hypothetical taxes are deducted from their gross salary, this amount would need to be grossed up for tax purposes to arrive at the chargeable pay in the host country.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
## Employment income
Employment income derived by an employee shall be deemed to be Ethiopian-source income:
  * to the extent that it is derived in respect of employment exercised in Ethiopia wherever paid, or
  * it is paid to the employee by or on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, wherever employment is exercised.


According to the Ethiopian Income Tax Proclamation, employment income includes:
  * Salary, wages, an allowance, bonus, commission, gratuity, or other remuneration received by an employee in respect of a past, current, or future employment.
  * The value of fringe benefit received by an employee in respect of a past, current, or future employment. Please note that the aggregate tax liability on fringe benefits shall not exceed 10% of the salary income of the employee.
  * An amount received by an employee on termination of employment, whether paid voluntarily, under an agreement, or as a result of legal proceedings, including any compensation for redundancy or loss of employment or a golden handshake payment.


In addition, where the employer is responsible for remitting the tax on behalf of their employees, the amount of tax paid by the employer shall be included as a taxable benefit.
## Equity compensation
The Federal Income Tax Proclamation (FITP) provides that allotment of shares to an employee under an employee share scheme, including shares allotted as a result of the exercise of an option or right to acquire the shares, is an employee share scheme fringe benefit.
The value of an employee share scheme fringe benefit shall be the fair market value of the shares at the date of allotment, reduced by the employee’s contribution for the shares.
Where shares allotted to an employee under an employee share scheme are subject to a restriction on the transfer of the shares, the employee is treated as having derived the employee share scheme benefit at the earlier of:
  * the time the employee can freely transfer the shares, or
  * the time the employee disposes of the shares.


## Capital gains
_See the_ _section in the Corporate tax summary for CGT rates and additional information_.
## Dividend income
Dividends declared by Ethiopian resident companies are subject to a 10% dividend withholding tax (WHT) for individual shareholders, which is the final tax.
## Interest income
Interest income is subject to WHT at a rate of 15%, which is the final tax.
## Rental income
Rental income is taxed under FITP No. 979/2016. Taxable value is calculated by taking the gross residential rental income less allowable deductions.
## Exempt income
The following items are exempt from income tax:
  * Amounts paid by employers to cover the actual cost of medical treatment of their employees.
  * Allowance in lieu of means of transportation granted to employees under an employment contract.

  * Travelling expenses paid to an employee recruited from a place other than the place of employment on joining or completion of employment, including, in the case of a foreign employee, travel expenses from and to their country of origin, but only if the travel expenses have been paid pursuant to specific provisions of the employee’s contract of employment.
  * Food and beverages provided to employees by an employer conducting a mining, manufacturing, or agricultural business.
  * An amount exempted from tax to the extent it is provided for under an international agreement.
  * An amount as compensation for personal injury or the death of another person.

## Social security contributions
All private organisations are required to register with the Private Organisation Employees Social Security Agency (‘pension fund’). It is mandatory for all Ethiopian citizens to contribute to social security and optional for foreign citizens with Ethiopian origin. Foreign citizens with no Ethiopian origin are not allowed to contribute to the fund.
Employers are required to contribute 11% of the employee’s basic salary to the scheme, while the employee’s contribution is at 7%.
Payment must be remitted by the employer for both the employee and employer contributions within 30 days from the date of deduction. Where a company fails to pay the pension contributions for three months, the Social Security Agency has the power to deduct the contributions in arrears from the company’s bank. All banks are required to cooperate on this.
