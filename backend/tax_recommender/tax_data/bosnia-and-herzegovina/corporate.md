The newest changes to the corporate income tax (CIT) regulations in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) relate to tax treatment of depreciation expense of the assets with the right to use in accordance with IFRS 16. The changes introduced full tax deductibility of such depreciation expenses calculated under the accounting depreciation rates. In other words, the depreciation expense is tax deductible for the period from commencement of a lease until the end of the useful life of the lease.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
## FBiH group taxation
A business association has the right to request tax consolidation on the condition that all businesses in the group are residents of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A headquarters company and its branches may form a business association when there is direct or indirect control between them with no less than 50% share.
A request for tax consolidation must be filed to the authorised branch office of the tax authorities by a headquarters company.
Each group member is required to file its tax balance, and the headquarters of the business association may file a consolidated tax balance for the group.
The consolidated tax balance may offset losses of one or more businesses against the profit of other businesses in the association.
Individual group members are liable for the tax calculated on the consolidated balance proportionately to the profit from the individual tax balance, and the headquarters is the payer of the tax calculated on the consolidated balance.
Once approved, tax consolidation shall be applied for the consecutive period of no less than five years.
When one, several, or all the businesses in the association later opt for individual taxation, all group members shall be obligated to pay the difference proportionately on behalf of the tax privilege they have used.
## RS group taxation
The CIT Law of Republika Srpska does not envisage a possibility of group taxation in Republika Srpska.
## BD group taxation
An affiliated group of legal persons located within Brčko District may elect to file a consolidated annual tax declaration.
An affiliated group of legal persons is a group of one or more legal entities from Brčko District that are connected through the ownership of stock with a common parent, provided that the common parent owns at least 80% of the stock in a legal person that is included in the affiliated group.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing requirements are imposed at the entity level. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and Brčko District have different regulations in place, including different rules in regard to applicable methods, related parties, and documentation. The regulations in place do not differ if the transactions are within one entity, cross-border, or international. Basically, this means that all transactions can fall under the transfer pricing scope.
With Bosnia and Herzegovina not being an EU or an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member, the local legislation does not have the same requirements with respect to transfer pricing documentation as in EU countries nor does the legislation refer to the OECD guidelines.
### FBiH related parties
In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a related party is considered to be an individual or legal person who has the possibility of control or significant influence on the business decisions of the taxpayer. Owning more than 25% of stocks or shares in a company is considered to be enabled control.
Significant influence is considered to be mutually high sales turnover, technical dependence, or otherwise gained control over the management.
### FBiH prescribed methods
The FBiH CIT law recognises the following methods:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method (primary method). 
  * Cost plus method. 
  * Resale price method. 


Alternatively, in case these methods cannot be applied, the following methods can be used:
  * Profit split method. 
  * Transaction net margin method. 


In case that none of the above-mentioned methods can be applied, any other method that can reasonably be applied for determination of the arm’s-length principle is allowed.
### FBiH country-by-country (CbC) reporting regime
The parent company is required to submit Form CBC-901 if the company is a resident of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and generates gross consolidated income of a minimum of BAM 1.5 billion.
### RS related parties
Under the CIT Law of Republika Srpska, a related party is a person or legal entity that directly or indirectly participates in management, control, or capital of another legal entity. Also, two legal entities are considered to be related if the same person(s) directly or indirectly participates in management, control, or capital of both legal entities.
It is considered that a person directly or indirectly participates in management, control, or capital of a legal entity when it directly or indirectly owns at least 25% of the shares in that legal entity or when it has a factual possibility to control business decisions of that other legal entity.
A person is considered to have a factual possibility of control on business decisions of another legal entity when one:
  * has or controls 25% or more of the voting rights in another legal entity 
  * has a control on assembly of the management board of another legal entity 
  * has a right to participate in the profit of another legal entity of 25% or more 
  * is a family member or a related person to a family member, or 
  * in any other way has a factual control on business decisions of another legal entity. 


### RS CbC reporting regime
The transfer pricing documentation must provide an overview of the distribution of income, taxes, and business activities and a list of all units of the group by area of tax jurisdiction, the CbC form, if the income of the group to which the taxpayer belongs is more than 750 million euros (EUR).
### BD related parties
Under the CIT Law of Brčko District, related parties of a legal person are considered to be physical or legal persons if those persons possess more than 10% of active shares with voting rights.
A legal person can be a related party if it directly or indirectly possesses more than 10% active shares in the other person. Indirect ownership is considered to be:
  * If a legal person possesses more than 10% of a dependent company, and that dependent company possesses more than 10% in the other legal person. 
  * If both legal persons have a common shareholder who possesses more than 10% active shares with voting rights in both legal persons. 


### BD CbC reporting regime
The Brčko District has not enacted a CbC reporting regime.
### RS and BD prescribed methods
The RS and BD regulations prescribe the following five methods that can be used in order to establish whether the prices are in accordance with the arm’s-length principle:
  * CUP method (primary method). 
  * Cost plus method. 
  * Resale price method. 
  * Profit split method. 
  * Transactional net margin method. 


## FBiH thin capitalisation
Under the thin capitalisation rule of the CIT Law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to be entitled to deduct interest expenses on loans received from a related party, a company's ratio between total liabilities from related-party loans and the company's registered equity should not exceed 4:1. Interest expense related to the liabilities from related-party loans exceeding the ratio 4:1 shall be non-deductible for CIT purposes.
The CIT Law prescribes that this rule does not apply to banks and insurance companies.
## RS thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Republika Srpska.
## BD thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Brčko District.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Bosnia and Herzegovina has no rules on CFCs.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Representative offices of foreign companies can be registered in all three administrative units.
A branch of a foreign legal entity can be registered in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Republika Srpska. The tax treatment of the branch of a foreign legal entity is still quite unclear from the local perspective, so we recommend contacting a tax and accounting specialist.
BD regulations do not allow registration of branch of a foreign legal entity.

## RS tax incentives
### RS foreign tax credit

For a taxpayer who in the territory of Republika Srpska invests in plant and equipment for performing registered production activity, the tax base will be decreased for the amount of performed investment.
Tax base can be decreased in the tax period in which the plant and equipment were put in use. 
If the taxpayer disposes the property and equipment before expiry of three years from the date when they were put in use, the taxpayer losses right to incentive and will have to pay the additional tax as if they never used the incentive, as well as penalty interest for late payments.
## BD tax incentives
### BD foreign tax credit
If a legal entity from Brčko District obtains revenue from a foreign state and the revenue is taxed both in Brčko District and in the foreign state, then the tax paid to the foreign state, whether paid directly or withheld and remitted by another person, is to be credited from the BD CIT, unless such legal entity from Brčko District elects to treat the foreign tax as a deductible expenditure in determining the fiscal year tax base.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Taxable profit is profit determined by adjusting the accounting profit as stated in the profit and loss statement and determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards/International Accounting Standards (IFRS/IAS) and accounting legislation, in accordance with the provisions of the CIT law. 
## FBiH income
Taxable income in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the income determined in the financial statements, increased for tax non-deductible costs and other tax non-deductible items and decreased for non-taxable items in accordance with the CIT Law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Income on the basis of collected written-off debt, in the event that it was included in income in a previous period and was not subject to tax allowable or recognised expenditure, shall not be included in the tax base.
### FBiH inventory valuation
Expenses of production in accordance with accounting regulations and IFRS/IAS shall be recognised in the value of stocks of unfinished production, semi products, and finished products for the calculation of taxable profit.
The inventory is valued by using the average price method.
### FBiH capital gains
Capital gains that increase the CIT base are all amounts that directly increase the accumulated or current profit in the balance sheet in accordance with IAS.
Capital gains that increase the CIT base are also considered to be gains from transactions of sales or transfers of assets if such profit is not included in the balance sheet. Such capital gains are determined as the difference between the value of the transaction and the purchase value, deducted for tax depreciation. If such difference is negative, it is considered as a capital loss.
For the purpose of determining the capital gains, the price of the transaction is the price stipulated in the contract, or the market price of the transaction if the stipulated price is lower than the market price.
Increase or decrease of taxpayer's equity performed in accordance with the Company Law is not considered as capital gain or loss. 
### FBiH dividend income
Dividends realised based on participation in the capital of other taxpayers shall not be included in the tax base. Shares in the profit of a business association will be considered dividends.
### FBiH interest income
Interest income is generally included in the taxable base.

Purchase value of inventories at the beginning and end of a fiscal year has to be expressed using the same method for determination of purchase value of inventories.
The costs of material and purchase value of sold goods can be determined by using the weighted average cost method or the first in first out (FIFO) method.
### RS capital gains
Capital gain is realised through the sale or other type of transfer of capital or investment assets and represents a difference between the sales price and adjusted base of an asset. The sales price is the contracted price (i.e. the market price established by the competent tax authority in case it finds the contracted price to be lower than the market price).
