## Innovation-driven activities for intellectual property (IP) assets
An income tax exemption is available for companies set up on or after 1 July 2017, which are involved in innovation-driven activities for IP assets developed in Mauritius. The exemption will apply for eight tax years, starting from the tax year in which the company starts its innovation-driven activities. Similar tax exemptions have been introduced for income derived from the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and high-tech products by companies incorporated after 8 June 2017; these will be available for eight years from the tax year in which the company starts operation.
## Exploitation and use of deep ocean water for air conditioning installations
Income derived from the exploitation and use of deep ocean water for air conditioning installations, facilities, and services will be exempted for eight tax years. Additionally, a company incurring expenditure on deep ocean water air conditioning may deduct from its gross income twice the amount of the expenditure incurred in that tax year. That deduction will be allowed for five consecutive tax years, starting from the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
## Expenditure on research and development (R&D)
During the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2022, if a person has incurred any qualifying expenditure on R&D as described below that is directly related to one’s existing trade or business, one may, in the tax year in which the qualifying expenditure was incurred, deduct twice the amount of the expenditure, provided that the R&D is carried out in Mauritius and no annual allowances have been claimed on the same. The term ‘qualifying expenditure’ means any expenditure relating to R&D, including expenditure on innovation, improvement, or development of a process, product, or service, as well as staff costs, consumable items, computer software directly used in R&D, and development and subcontracted R&D.
## Reduced tax rate for companies exporting goods
A company involved in the export of goods will be liable to income tax at the reduced rate of 3% on the chargeable income attributable to exports, as computed on the basis of the following formula:
Chargeable income attributable to exports = (A x C/B), in which:
  * A is the gross income derived from the export of goods in that income year.
  * B is the gross income derived from all the activities of the company for that income year.
  * C is the chargeable income of the company for that income year.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Taxable period
Companies are assessed for a year beginning 1 July and ending 30 June on their income for the preceding year ending 30 June. Where a company closes its accounts at a date other than 30 June, it may elect to adopt as a basis year the accounting year ending in the 12-month period preceding the year of assessment.
## Tax returns
Every company, both taxpayer and non-taxpayer, must file a return of its income on the basis of the income year preceding the year of assessment. The return must be filed within six months of the financial year-end.
## Payment of tax
Any tax due should be paid when the return is filed and within the six months deadline.
### Advance Payment System (APS)
Every company (except non-resident trusts and non-resident partnerships) having gross income exceeding MUR 10 million or that has taxable income is required to submit an APS statement and pay any tax for the quarter immediately following the end of the accounting year.
Tax under APS can be calculated based on the following:
  * 25% of taxable income for the accounting year immediately preceding the commencement of that quarter or
  * the actual taxable income of the current quarter.


The APS statement shall be filed and tax (if any) shall be payable within three months from the end of the quarter.
Companies that are required to contribute to the CSR Fund should, while submitting their APS statement, remit 25% of the CSR amount to be remitted to the MRA.
### Penalties
If timely payment is not made, a penalty representing 5% of the amount of tax due is payable. In addition, interest at the rate of 0.5% of the tax unpaid for each month or part of a month is payable until the tax is paid. A penalty of MUR 2,000 for each month or part of a month is also prescribed for failure to file a return, subject to a maximum of MUR 20,000.
## Tax audit process
Tax audits are carried out on a sample basis throughout the year. Generally, the audits are fairly detailed, but more protracted enquiries are carried out into cases where fraud is suspected.
## Statute of limitations
While there is no statutory time limit for recovering tax already assessed, the Director General is barred from making an assessment for a period beyond three years preceding the current tax year.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The MRA pays special attention to the arm’s-length nature of any transactions between related parties and evidence of foreign tax suffered predominantly for GBL companies in respect of their claim for actual foreign tax credit.

A company not incorporated in Mauritius is resident in Mauritius only if it is centrally managed and controlled in Mauritius.
In the absence of a tax treaty, any income derived from the following is taxed in Mauritius:
  * Any business carried on wholly or partly in Mauritius.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
## Depreciation
Annual allowance rates vary between 5% and 100% of base value (unless stated otherwise), as per the following table:
Capital expenditure incurred on | Rate of annual allowance  
---|---  
Percentage of  
Base value | Cost  
Industrial premises, excluding hotels | 5  
Industrial premises dedicated to manufacturing | 30  
Commercial premises | 5  
Hotels | 30  
Plant or machinery:  
Costing MUR 60,000 or less | 100  
Costing more than MUR 60,000:  
Ships or aircraft | 20  
Aircraft and aircraft simulators leased by a company engaged in aircraft leasing | 100  
Motor vehicles | 25  
Electronic and high precision machinery or equipment, computer hardware and peripherals, and computer software | 50  
Plant and machinery (excluding passenger car) by a manufacturing company | 50  
Furniture and fittings | 20  
Other | 35  
Improvement on agricultural land for agricultural purposes | 25  
Scientific research | 25  
Golf courses | 15  
Acquisition of patent | 25  
Green technology equipment | 50  
Landscaping and other earth works for embellishment | 50  
Acquisition or improvement of any other item of a capital nature that is subject to depreciation under the normal accounting principles | 5  
Tax depreciation need not conform to book depreciation. Depreciation is generally recaptured on disposal or sale when balancing charges or allowances are computed.
## Goodwill
Goodwill amortised under normal accounting principles is not allowed as an expense for tax purposes. However, the cost amount can be capitalised, and an annual allowance of 5% of cost can be claimed.
## Leasing agreements
Where an asset is transferred under a financial lease agreement, the lessee is entitled to capital allowances on the value of the asset, including finance charges, as if it was an outright sale by the lessor.
On the other hand, the lessor cannot capitalise the leased assets in its books, and no capital allowance is claimed on the assets leased. However, the lessor is taxable on the interest income derived from the assets leased.
There have been changes brought by IFRS 16 leases with regards to operating leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognise operating leases on the balance sheet that will reflect their right to use an asset for a period of time and the associated liability for payments. According to the Statement of Practice from the MRA, the lessee is allowed to claim the rental expenditure as an allowable deduction. The interest expense in the Income Statement will not be an allowable deduction. Also, the lessee will not be allowed to claim capital allowances on the leased assets.
## Set-up costs
Set-up costs are not deductible for tax purposes, as they are considered pre-operational expenses.
## Interest expenses
Expenditure incurred on interest is deductible, provided it is incurred in respect of capital employed exclusively in the production of income.
A request can be made by the tax authorities to support any claim made in respect of interest expense by a certificate from a qualified auditor certifying that the amount of interest claimed has been incurred on capital employed exclusively in the production of gross income.
Interest paid by a GBL to a non-resident out of its foreign source income is exempt from corporate tax.
The tax authorities may refuse to allow a deduction on expenditure incurred as interest where it is found that:
  * the interest is payable to a non-resident who is not chargeable to tax on the amount of the interest, or
  * the interest is not likely to be paid in cash within a reasonable time.


## Bad debt
A provision for bad or doubtful debt is generally not deductible unless legal actions have been taken against the debtor.
## Charitable contributions
Donations/gifts, whether to charitable institutions or not, are not deductible for tax purposes.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible for tax purposes as they are expenses not exclusively incurred for the production of gross income.
## Taxes
Income taxes and foreign taxes paid are not normally deductible; however, some taxes (e.g. municipal taxes relating to buildings, land transfer tax, irrecoverable input VAT) are deductible.
## Other significant items
A bank or an approved financial institution may claim as deductions any irrecoverable loans due by a company in liquidation in respect of which winding-up procedures have started or by a company in receivership.
## Net operating losses
Losses made in an accounting year are carried forward for a maximum of five years.
A company may claim to carry forward to an income year any loss it incurred in any former income year, provided the company can demonstrate a 50% continuity of shareholding at the end of those income years. Losses resulting from capital allowances can be carried forward indefinitely. Loss carrybacks are not permitted.
Where a company takes over another company engaged in manufacturing activities, two or more companies engaged in manufacturing activities merge into one company, or a company acquires the whole or part of the undertaking of another company and the Minister has deemed such a take-over or transfer of undertaking to be in the public interest, any unrelieved loss of the acquiree may be transferred to the acquirer in the income year in which the takeover takes place, on such conditions relating to safeguard of employment as may be approved by the Minister of Finance.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Royalties, interest, and service fees payable to foreign affiliates are allowed as expenses, provided they correspond to actual expenses incurred, are reasonable, and do not exceed what would be paid under an arm’s-length agreement. There are certain limitations if the recipient of the interest is not liable to Mauritius tax. Withholding tax may apply on payments to foreign affiliates, depending on the nature of such payments. 


# Mauritius
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 16 December 2024
There are no group taxation provisions in the Mauritius tax legislation other than the transfer of losses by tax incentive companies, sugar factory operators, subsidiaries located in the Island of Rodrigues, and manufacturing companies upon their take-over (_see Net operating losses in the section for more information_).
## Transfer pricing
Mauritius does not have any specific transfer pricing legislation. However, there is an arm's-length provision requiring transactions between related parties to reflect a commercially objective value, which would be the amount charged for the services were the parties not connected.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The government of Mauritius enacted the Income Tax (Country-by-Country Reporting) Regulations (CbCR) 2018 on 19 February 2018. These regulations will be effective for the reporting fiscal years of MNE groups beginning on or after 1 July 2018.
The purpose of CbCR is to provide local tax authorities with visibility regarding an MNE's revenue, profit, tax paid and accrued, stated capital, accumulated earnings, number of employees, tangible assets, and activities.
CbCR applies to MNEs with annual consolidated group revenue equal to or higher than EUR 750 million. The tax authority with which the CbC Report is filed will exchange the CbC Report with the tax authority in other jurisdictions where the group has operations. Any person who fails to comply with any provision of CbCR shall commit an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding MUR 5,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.
## Thin capitalisation
Mauritius does not have specific thin capitalisation legislation; however, other anti-avoidance provisions as described below may apply.
If a company has issued debentures to its shareholders (subject to the number, the nominal value, or paid-up value of the shares in that company), any interest paid on debentures and claimed as a deductible expense may be disallowed and treated as a dividend.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
CFC rules have been introduced in Mauritius effective as of the year of assessment commencing 1 July 2020. The attribution of CFC income shall be calculated in accordance with the arm’s-length principle.
A CFC is a company that is not resident in Mauritius and in which a resident company in Mauritius or together with associated enterprises holds more than 50% of its total participation rights directly and indirectly. A CFC also includes a PE of the resident company.
CFC rules are not applicable where, in an income year,:
  * accounting profits are less than EUR 750,000 and non-trading income is less than EUR 75,000
  * accounting profits are less than 10% of its operating costs of the tax period, or
  * the tax rate in the country of residence of the CFC is more than 50% of the tax rate in Mauritius.


The CFC rules applies where the MRA consider that the non-distributed income of the CFC arises from non-genuine arrangements designed for obtaining tax benefits.

## Global Business Licence (GBL) companies
As of 1 January 2019, GBC1 companies have been renamed as GBL companies.

    * Foreign dividend, subject to amount not allowed as deduction in source country.
    * Interest income.
    * Profit attributable to a PE of a resident company in a foreign country.
    * Foreign-source income derived by a CIS, Closed End Funds, CIS manager, CIS administrator, investment adviser or asset manager licensed or approved by the FSC.
    * Income derived by companies engaged in ship and aircraft leasing.
    * Interest income derived by a person from money lent through a peer-to-peer lending platform operated under a licence issued by the FSC after the five-year tax holiday.
    * Income derived from the leasing and provision of international fibre capacity.
    * Income derived from reinsurance and reinsurance brokering activities.

80% exemption on the above activities is subject to satisfying prescribed conditions.
  * 95% tax exemption on interest earned by a CIS or Closed End Funds.
  * No actual foreign tax credit is allowed on foreign-source income if the GBL company has claimed the 80% exemption.


The registration and application of GBLs should be submitted to the FSC through a duly licensed Management Company on a prescribed form accompanied by the following:
  * The certified supporting documents.
  * The applicable processing fees and relevant fees.


A GBL is tax resident in Mauritius and may apply for a Tax Residence Certificate (TRC) from the Director General of the MRA should this be required by the tax authorities in the jurisdiction in which the company is conducting its business.
Investors may benefit from an extensive network of double taxation treaties (DTTs). Entities holding a GBL wishing to benefit from a DTT must obtain a TRC issued by the MRA. The TRC is generally issued within a period of seven days from the date of application, provided that the person has submitted the return required under the ITA 1995.
The Financial Services Act has been amended to include the following conditions that should at all times be satisfied by a GBL company:
  * The core income generating activities of the GBL should be in or from Mauritius, as required under the Income Tax Act.
  * The GBL companies should be managed and controlled from Mauritius and be administered by a management company.


In order for a GBL to be managed and controlled from Mauritius, it should meet the following conditions:
  * It has at least two directors, resident in Mauritius, of sufficient calibre to exercise independence of mind and judgment.
  * It maintains, at all times, its principal bank account in Mauritius.
  * It keeps and maintains, at all times, its accounting records at its registered office in Mauritius.
  * It prepares, or proposes to prepare, its statutory financial statements and causes or proposes to have such financial statements to be audited in Mauritius.
  * It provides for meetings of directors to include at least two directors from Mauritius.


In order to benefit from the 80% exemption, a company may outsource any relevant activities to third party service providers, provided that:
  * the company is able to demonstrate adequate monitoring of the outsourced activities
  * the outsourced activities are conducted in Mauritius, and
  * the economic substance of service providers is not counted multiple times by multiple companies when evidencing their own substance in Mauritius.


As of January 2019, the Category 2 Global Business Licence (GBC2) has been abolished, and companies previously holding a GBC2 licence must apply for an authorisation from the FSC as an Authorised Company. An Authorised Company will be required to file a return of income to the MRA within six months of its year-end. However, an Authorised Company is treated as a non-resident for tax purposes in Mauritius and will be taxed on Mauritius-source income only. 
Only a management company shall act as the registered agent of an Authorised Company. An Authorised Company is a company conducting business outside Mauritius and can engage in activities other than the following:
  * Banking.
  * Financial services.
  * Holding, managing, or otherwise dealing with a collective investment fund or scheme as a professional functionary.
  * Providing registered office facilities, nominee services, directorship services, secretarial services, or other services for corporations.
  * Providing trusteeship services by way of business.


An applicant for an Authorised Company must submit the following forms/documents to the FSC through a management company:
  * The application form, duly filled in and signed.
  * The certified supporting documents.
  * The applicable processing fees and relevant fees.


## Companies in the Freeport zone
Freeport operators and private Freeport developers will no longer be exempted from income tax. However, Freeport licences issued on or before 14 June 2018 will continue to benefit from the current tax exemption until 30 June 2021.
Effective as of the year of assessment commencing on 1 July 2020, Freeport operators or private Freeport developers engaged in the manufacture of goods will be liable to tax at the rate of 3% from sale of goods on local market, provided certain substance conditions are met.
Freeport operators will be liable to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on local sales.
## Income tax exemption for vessel owners
Owners of foreign vessels registered in Mauritius are exempt from income tax on income derived from the operation of such vessels, including any income derived from the chartering of such vessels. Owners of local vessels registered in Mauritius are also exempt to the extent that the income is derived from deep-sea international trade only.
## Innovation-driven activities
An income tax exemption is available for companies set up on or after 1 July 2017 that are involved in innovation-driven activities for IP assets developed in Mauritius. The exemption will apply for eight tax years, starting from the tax year in which the company starts its innovation-driven activities.
## Manufacture of pharmaceutical products, medical devices
An income tax exemption is available for companies set up on or after 8 June 2017 for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and high-tech products by companies incorporated after 8 June 2017. This exemption also applies for eight tax years, starting from the tax year in which the company starts its operations.
## Green economy
Income derived from the exploitation and use of deep ocean water for air conditioning installations, facilities, and services will be exempted for eight tax years. Further, a company incurring expenditure on deep ocean water air conditioning may deduct from its gross income twice the amount of the expenditure incurred in that tax year. That deduction will be allowed for five consecutive tax years, starting from the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Another tax exemption has been granted for interest derived by individuals and companies from debentures or bonds issued by a company to finance renewable energy projects (the issue must be approved by the Director General of the MRA).
If a company incurs expenditure in a tax year for the acquisition and setting up of a water desalination plant, it may deduct from its gross income twice the amount of the expenditure incurred in that tax year.
## R&D expenditure
During a period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2022, if a person has incurred any qualifying expenditure on R&D as described below that is directly related to one’s existing trade or business, one may, in the tax year in which the qualifying expenditure was incurred, deduct twice the amount of the expenditure, provided that the R&D is carried out in Mauritius and no annual allowances have been claimed on the same.
The term ‘qualifying expenditure’ means any expenditure relating to R&D, including expenditure on innovation, improvement, or development of a process, product, or service as well as staff costs, consumable items, computer software directly used in R&D, and development and subcontracted R&D.
## Export of goods
A reduced corporate tax rate has been introduced for exports of goods so that if, in a tax year, a company is engaged in the export of goods, it will be liable to income tax at the reduced rate of 3% on the chargeable income attributable to that export, as computed on the basis of the following formula:
Chargeable income attributable to that export = (A x C/B), in which:
  * A is the gross income derived from the export of goods in that income year.
  * B is the gross income derived from all the activities of the company for that income year.
  * C is the chargeable income of the company for that income year.


## Import of goods in semi knocked down form
Companies importing goods in semi knocked down form are entitled to an investment tax credit of 5% over three years (up to 30 June 2020) on the acquisition of new plant and machinery, excluding motor cars, are subject to a local value add of at least 20%. Tax credit will be available on investments up to 30 June 2020.
## Foreign tax credits
Generally, double taxation is avoided by means of unilateral credit relief for foreign tax paid. The net amount of foreign income that has borne tax is grossed up at the foreign rate of tax, and the foreign tax paid is allowed as a credit against the Mauritius tax payable. However, the tax credit cannot exceed the Mauritius tax referable to the relevant foreign income. Unused credit is not refunded.
Regarding foreign income derived from countries with which Mauritius has DTTs, a tax credit is given for foreign tax in accordance with the treaties. There are clauses in the DTTs that provide that income arising from certain specified foreign sources is to be exempt from Mauritius tax.
Mauritius has signed DTTs with 44 countries (_see the section for a listing_).
The following treaties await ratification: Gabon, Ghana, Jersey, Morocco, Nigeria, and Russia.
The following treaties await signature: Cote d'Ivoire, Gibraltar, Kenya, Malawi, and The Gambia.
The following treaties are being negotiated: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Canada, Czech Republic, Greece, Hong Kong, Lesotho, Mali, Montenegro, North Sudan, Portugal, Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Spain, St. Kitts and Nevis, Tanzania, Vietnam, Yemen, and Zambia.
In the case of actual foreign tax credit claimed on foreign dividends, the general tax credit includes foreign tax imposed on the profits out of which the dividends are paid (underlying tax), provided that the shareholding in the foreign company is at least 5%.
Mauritius also allows a tax-sparing credit under its local tax legislation.

## United States (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The Republic of Mauritius and the United States of America have signed an Agreement for the Exchange of Information Relating to Taxes (the Agreement) to set the legal framework to enable exchange of tax information between the two countries, including the Inter-Governmental Agreement (Model 1 IGA).
The Agreement provides for exchange of tax information (upon request, spontaneous and automatic) between Mauritius and the United States. The IGA provides for the automatic reporting and exchange of information in relation to accounts held with Mauritius financial institutions by US persons and the reciprocal exchange of information regarding financial accounts held by Mauritius residents in the United States.
The MRA has issued guidance notes (available on MRA’s website) to provide practical assistance to financial institutions, businesses, their advisers, and officials dealing with the application of FATCA.
## Corporate Reporting Standards (CRS)
Mauritius signed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.
The Mauritius ITA was amended to enact the CRS, and the MRA is the competent authority to administer the process. Under the CRS, financial institutions (FIs) will need to report accounts held by non-residents to the MRA, which will be used for eventual exchange with other jurisdictions. In line with the OECD commentaries and handbook on the CRS, the MRA published a set of guidance notes (MRA Guidance Notes) to help identify which FIs have reporting obligations as well as set out the type of financial information and accounts that will need to be reported.
## Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
As a member of the all-inclusive framework, Mauritius has pledged commitments to implement the BEPS Actions. At an initial stage, all participating countries have to adopt the minimum standards, namely Action 5: Harmful tax practices, Action 6: Treaty abuse, Action 13: CbC reporting, and Action 15: Multilateral instrument (MLI) to implement the treaty measures in the BEPS framework.
Mauritius is a signatory to the MLI and has adopted the principal purpose test as a measure to address treaty abuse. Mauritius has been removed from the European Union (EU) blacklist as of 7 January 2022.
Mauritius enacted the Income Tax (Country-by-Country Reporting) Regulations 2018 on 19 February 2018. These regulations will be effective for the reporting fiscal years of MNE groups beginning on or after 1 July 2018. _See Country-by-country (CbC) reporting in the section_.

## Inventory valuation
Inventories should be valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value. The last in first out (LIFO) basis of valuation is not allowed for tax purposes.
Conformity is required between book and tax reporting. Where the MRA is not satisfied that the basis of valuation is acceptable (e.g. where the LIFO basis has been applied), it will make such adjustment as it believes is appropriate to determine the profits arising from the business carried on.
## Capital gains
There is no tax on capital gains in Mauritius. However, certain transactions are taxed as ordinary business profit instead of capital gains. Where a transaction is in the nature of trade, the MRA may take the view that it is an ordinary trading transaction and assess the gains derived as income.
Gains realised from the sale of any property or interest in property acquired in the course of a business, as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme, are taxable as ordinary income.
## Dividend income
Companies, whether resident or not, are exempt from tax on dividends received from resident companies.
Dividend income received from abroad by a company resident in Mauritius is subject to tax at the rate of 15%. The company can claim either:
  * the 80% partial exemption on gross amount received or
  * credit for any foreign tax withheld, subject to documentary evidence being available. 


Dividend income received from abroad by a company resident in Mauritius (including a GBL) is therefore subject to tax at an effective rate of 3%, subject to meeting prescribed conditions.
### Stock dividends
A resident company can distribute stock dividends (bonus shares) proportionately to all of its shareholders. Stock dividends _per se_ or convertible into cash are not taxable in the hands of the recipient. Dividends in kind (i.e. other than cash or shares) are treated as taxable benefits.
## Interest income
Interest income received by resident companies (including a GBL) is liable to tax at the rate of 15%. The interest income (excluding bank interest) will qualify for 80% exemption on gross amount received, subject to meeting prescribed conditions.
Interest income paid by any person, other than by banks or non-bank deposit-taking institutions under the Banking Act, to individuals and non-residents is liable to withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 15% (final tax). Interest payments by a GBL to a non-resident out of its foreign-source income is exempt from WHT.
## Royalty income
Royalty income received locally is subject to tax at the rate of 15%.
Royalty income received from abroad is subject to tax at the rate of 15%. Any tax withheld from abroad will be allowed as a foreign tax credit.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are taxed on their worldwide income, but tax credit and treaty relief is generally available in order to avoid double taxation (_see Foreign tax credits in the section for more information_).
