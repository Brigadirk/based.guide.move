## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is charged by VAT-registered entities at the standard rate of 15% on all goods and services supplied by them in Mauritius (except those taxed at 0%), other than the following exempt supplies (not an exhaustive list):
  * Wheat and cereal flours (excluding wheat flour).
  * Medical, hospital, and dental services, including clinical laboratory services, services provided in a health institution, and veterinary services.
  * Educational and training services provided by institutions approved by the Mauritius Qualification Authority.
  * Sale or transfer of building for residential purpose.
  * Banking services, except: 
    * services provided to merchants accepting credit/debit card
    * services in respect of safe deposit locker, and issue and renewal of credit/debit cards
    * services for keeping and maintaining customer’s accounts, and
    * services supplied by a bank holding a banking licence under Banking Act 2004 in respect of its banking transactions with non-residents and corporations holding a Global Business Licence.
  * Essential products, such as noodles, toothpastes, toothbrushes, etc.
  * Medical grade silicone.
  * All musical instruments, including parts and accessories.
  * Glass ceramic blocks for dental use.

An entity should register for VAT if turnover exceeds MUR 6 million a year. However, certain service providers (e.g. accountants and auditors, attorneys and solicitors, consultants, surveyors, valuers) should register for VAT irrespective of their turnover.
VAT-registered persons with annual taxable turnover exceeding MUR 10 million should submit their VAT return monthly and electronically by the end of the month following the end of the taxable month. Otherwise, VAT return filing is completed quarterly (i.e. within 20 days following the end of a taxable quarter). The taxable quarter is a period of three months ending at the end of March, June, September, or December. Also, where the VAT-registered persons are filing pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) returns electronically under the Income Tax Act (ITA), they are required to file the VAT returns electronically by the end of the month following the taxable period.
