## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Finnish resident companies are subject to Finnish corporate income tax (CIT) on their worldwide income (i.e. unlimited tax liability). Also, Finnish permanent establishments (PEs) of non-resident companies are subject to Finnish CIT on their worldwide income attributable to the PE.
The CIT rate is 20%.
## Pillar Two Implementation
Finland has implemented Pillar Two legislation, including Income Inclusion rule (IIR), the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), and the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT). The IIR and QDMTT are applied for financial years starting on or after 31 December 2023, and the UTPR is applied for financial years starting on or after 31 December 2024.
The Finnish Pillar Two law closely follows the related EU Directive and the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules. In the government proposal the central role of the OECD’s (existing and future) guidance is clearly acknowledged in the proposal as a key to ensure harmonious implementation globally and to avoid differing interpretations across jurisdictions. However, some relevant aspects of the OECD’s recent guidance are not yet incorporated in the Finnish law, and further updates to the law are expected.
The Finnish constitution requires that a tax law should include a sufficient level of detail to allow taxpayers to calculate their tax liability and leave little room for interpretation. These constitutional restrictions may cause uncertainties with respect to application of specific rules based on the OECD guidance where those deviate from the Finnish Pillar Two legislation.

## Public service broadcasting tax
Public service broadcasting tax (_Yleisradio_ or YLE tax) for companies and organisations is based on the taxable income for a fiscal year. The tax amounts to 140 euros (EUR) per year if the taxable income of the organisation is at least EUR 50,000. For organisations with taxable income exceeding EUR 50,000, the tax is levied at EUR 140 plus 0.35% of the taxable income exceeding EUR 50,000. The maximum of the annual tax is EUR 3,000, which will be payable by organisations with taxable income of EUR 867,142 or more.
YLE tax is deductible in the taxation of income of a company.
## Local income taxes
No municipal or local income taxes are levied in Finland on the income of a company.
