## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 November 2023
Corporations operating in Puerto Rico as a branch may be subject to a 10% tax on the dividend equivalent amount (commonly known as the branch profit tax or BPT). The BPT should be determined and paid along with the CIT return. There will not be an income tax withholding at source at the time cash transfers are made by the Puerto Rico branch to its home office outside of Puerto Rico.
