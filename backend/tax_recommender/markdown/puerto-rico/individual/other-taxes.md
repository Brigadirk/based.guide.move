### Sales and use tax (SUT)
SUT is imposed at 10.5% at the state level and an additional 1% at the municipal level, for an aggregate tax of 11.5%. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Puerto Rico does not have a net wealth/worth tax.
## Property taxes
The property tax system is administered by the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (MRCC). The tax on real property is directly assessed by the MRCC and may be paid in two instalments. The tax, which varies depending on the municipality, is applied to an amount based on the hypothetical fair market value (FMV) of the relevant property in the year 1957. In general terms, this hypothetical FMV normally ranges between 40% and 50% of the cost of the property.
## Luxury and excise taxes 
There are certain articles subject to a special excise tax, such as cigarettes, fuels, crude oils, vehicles, alcoholic beverages, cement, sugar, and plastic products, among others. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Payroll taxes
Puerto Rico employers are required to withhold from their employees certain payroll taxes in addition to the withholding for income tax. These payroll taxes are: Social Security and Medicare taxes, disability benefits tax, and chauffeur's and other employees' employment security tax. There are also payroll taxes only borne by the employer and should not be deducted from the employee's wages, such as: unemployment insurance tax (Puerto Rico and Federal) and workmen's accident compensation insurance tax.
All payroll taxes are required for Puerto Rican resident individuals. However, some payroll taxes may also be required for Puerto Rican non-resident US citizen or foreign national individuals.
