## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
El Salvador offers a wide range of incentives to attract foreign investment and drive new commercial and industrial developments. There are also no restrictions on foreign ownership or on mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures.
There are five specific laws in El Salvador that seek to encourage foreign investment by improving the countryâ€™s competitiveness in all areas involving the granting of tax incentives. These laws are the Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law, the Law of International Services, the Renewable Energy Incentives Law, the Tourism Law, and the Law for the promotion of Manufacturing and Technological Innovation.
### The Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law
The Industrial and Commercial Free Zone Law No. 405, dated 3 September 1998, grants companies the following incentives:
  * CIT exemption.
  * VAT exemption.
  * Municipal tax exemption.
  * Exemption from real estate transfer taxes when land is intended to be used for productive activities.
  * Exemption from duties for imports on machinery, raw materials, equipment, and intermediate goods used for production.
  * An option to sell merchandise or services linked to international trade produced in the free zone in the Salvadoran market as long as the corresponding import taxes, CIT, VAT, and municipal taxes are paid on the final goods or services.


Any foreign company may establish and function in a free zone or bonded warehouse and benefit from these incentives if they are engaged in production, assembly, manufacturing, processing, transformation, or commercialisation of goods and services and/or rendering of services linked to international or regional trade, such as gathering, packaging and repackaging, cargo consolidation, distribution of merchandise, and other activities connected or complementary to them.
### The Law of International Services
