Individuals whose income comes from salaries not exceeding USD 9,100 a year are not required to file a tax return, and are allowed a single deduction of USD 1,600, which is embodied into the withholding rates their income is subject to.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Income is understood to cover the taxpayer's overall income collected during the tax period in question, either in cash or in-kind, from sources such as labour, business activities, capital, and generally all types of income, gains, benefits, or profits, whatever their origin might be, as well as condoned debt.
## Employment income
Taxable compensation of employees, resident or non-resident, covers all types of income whether in cash or in-kind (e.g. salaries, bonuses, overtime, paid vacations, housing and car allowances, reimbursement for tax and children's educational expenses, benefits-in-kind).
Non-resident aliens are taxed on salary earned for work done in El Salvador, regardless of where payment is made and regardless of whether it is remitted. No separate treatment is afforded to foreigners.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are taxed at a flat 10% rate, except when the asset is realised within the 12 months following the date of acquisition, in which case capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. Capital losses can be offset by capital gains only. Whenever capital losses exceed capital gains, the balance may be offset against future capital gains for up to five years.
## Exempt income
Non-taxable income includes:
  * Interest, prizes, and other benefits directly earned on deposits maintained with banks and financial associations.
  * Profits or dividends paid to partners or stockholders, provided the corporation distributing them reports them and pays the corresponding income taxes.
  * Profits, dividends, prizes, income, capital gains, or any other reward obtained by individuals or generated by investments on purchase-sale of stocks and other instruments, provided the latter pertains to issuances registered and authorised by the Stock Exchange and the Superintendence of Securities, and they are traded in legally authorised exchange bureaus.
  * The Christmas bonuses by the workers under the Labour Code, up to an amount not exceeding two monthly minimum wages, in the commerce and services sector is exempt. Therefore, said income will not be subject to withholding.

## Social security contributions
In El Salvador, the social security system consists of the following benefits:
  * Health/maternity benefits: For health disability, the employer pays for the first three days; after the third day, social security covers 75% of the salary. In case of maternity leave, social security covers 100% of the monthly salary, and the employer grants a four-month leave for maternity care.
  * Disability: For a year or less of disability, social security pays a percentage of the salary; for disabilities over a year, pension funds will recognise a percentage of the salary, depending on the level of disability.
  * Old age: Retirement age for men is at 60 and for women is at 55 years, or they can retire after 30 years of labour services.
  * Death: Pension funds will pay the victim's family an allowance depending on the victim's amount of savings.
  * Pension fund (AFP): Savings for employees are obligatory through pension funds administrated by private Pension Fund Administrators.


Social security contributions (ISSS) are mandatory for both employee and employer and are destined to public health services. The employee’s contributions are withheld from the employee’s monthly salary and are transferred by the employer to the Salvadorian Institute of Social Security through monthly payrolls. The contribution amounts are summarised in the table below:
Monthly employee’s salary (USD) | Employee’s rate (%) | Employer’s rate (%)  
---|---|---  
0 to 1,000 | 3 | 7.50  
Note: For individuals who have salaries above USD 1,000, the social security contribution applicable is USD 30.00 for the employee and USD 75.00 for the employer.
Contributions to the AFP are mandatory for both employee and employer. The employee’s contributions are withheld from the employee’s monthly salary and are transferred by the employer.

Monthly employee’s salary (USD) | Employee's rate (%) | Employer’s rate (%)
