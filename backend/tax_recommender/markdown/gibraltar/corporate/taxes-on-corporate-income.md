The standard corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 15% (increasing from 12.5% with effect from 1 July 2024), with utility and energy providers and companies that abuse a dominant position paying a higher rate of 20%. For telecommunications companies, the 15% rate will apply to the gains and profits arising from their non-telecommunications business and activities.
