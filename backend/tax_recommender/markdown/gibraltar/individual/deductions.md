## Allowance Based System: Personal allowances and deductions
### Allowance Based System allowances
Personal relief is granted on submission of a claim to the tax office when applying for a tax code under the Allowance Based System (_see the section_). The main allowances (which are reduced by 1/12 for each complete calendar month that the individual is not resident in Gibraltar during the year of assessment) for the 2024/25 tax year are as follows:
Allowance | GBP  
---|---  
Personal allowance | 3,455  
Spouse | 3,455  
One parent family | 5,800  
Child | 1,190  
First child studying abroad | 1,375  
Disabled individuals | 10,000  
Nursery school allowance | 5,480  
House purchase allowance (1) | 13,000  
Additional home purchase allowance (2) | 4,000  
Life insurance premiums (3) | 100%  
Mortgage interest (4) | 100%  
Notes:
  1. This is a one-off allowance.
  2. This allowance is restricted to a maximum of GBP 1,000 _perannum_. In addition to any deduction, relief, or allowance, taxpayers with an interest in a building situated in Gibraltar can claim an allowance for approved expenditure on painting, decorating, repairing, or enhancing the frontage of the building.
  3. Allowable premiums up to 1/7 of assessable income or 7% of capital sum assured.
  4. Interest payable on a loan to acquire a Gibraltar property to be used as a taxpayer’s principle residence is allowable on loans up to a value of GBP 350,000. Loan arrangements entered into before 1 July 2008 are eligible for relief on 100% of the loan as long as the loan continues to be secured on the current property and is in the name of the current borrower. The interest on these loans are subject to ‘tapered grandfathering’, whereby the relief on the amount of the loan in excess of GBP 350,000 will be reduced by 1/10 _perannum_.


### Allowance Based System deductions 
In addition to the above allowances, individuals taxed under the Allowance Based System may also deduct expenses from their assessable income on the following:
  * Pension contributions paid to approved schemes, subject to restrictions.
  * Premiums paid on health insurance policies (up to a maximum of GBP 5,395).


## Gross Income Based System: Deductions
Persons under the Gross Income Based System may also benefit from deductions from their assessable income, as follows:
  * Up to a maximum of GBP 1,500 _per annum_ in respect of approved mortgage interest payments.
  * Up to a maximum of GBP 1,500 _per annum_ in respect of pension contributions.
  * Up to a maximum of GBP 5,000 in respect of approved expenditure incurred on the enhancement of the frontage of their property.
  * Up to a maximum of GBP 7,500 in respect of approved expenditure incurred towards the purchase of their home (this benefit is available to first-time home buyers only).
  * Up to a maximum of GBP 3,000 _per annum_ in respect of expenditure incurred towards private medical insurance premiums.
