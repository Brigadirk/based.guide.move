## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
An individual resident may derive income from another country, which is subject to tax in that country. The individual may credit the foreign income tax paid against the Mexican income tax liability. However, the credit is limited to the lesser of (i) the amount of foreign tax paid with respect to foreign-source income that is taxable in Mexico and (ii) the amount of Mexican tax corresponding to that income. In addition, no credit is allowed for foreign taxes imposed on income that is exempt from Mexican taxation.
## Tax treaties
Tax treaties may reduce or eliminate tax withholding from non-residents, and the treaty provisions should be analysed accordingly, depending on the country of residence of the individual receiving Mexican-source income.
