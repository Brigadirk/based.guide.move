Non-residents are subject to withholding taxes (WHTs) on Mexican-source interest income at rates varying from 0% to 35%, depending on several factors. Non-residents are subject to Mexican tax on gains arising from sales of real property located in Mexico (including shares of foreign companies holding a significant amount of Mexican real property) as well as the sale of shares of Mexican companies. Generally, when a capital gain is subject to tax, the non-resident investor can elect to pay either a flat rate of 25% of the gross proceeds or 35% of the net gain. Sales of shares in the Mexican stock exchange are subject to a flat 10% tax withholding on the profit from said transaction.
Other types of Mexican-source income (including rents and royalties) are also subject to WHTs when paid to a non-resident. In the case of dividends and other corporate distributions from Mexican companies, since 2014, there is a 10% tax withholding on the dividends from corporate profits generated after 2013.
