Corporate residence is generally determined by reference to the place of establishment.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
There is no specific definition of PE in the Macau Complementary Tax Law. Technically speaking, there are two major criteria for determining whether a foreign entity should be subject to complementary tax, and the key phrases are 'engaging in commercial/industrial activities' and/or 'rendering services in Macau SAR'. These phrases are also not defined. Generally, if a foreign entity is engaged in commercial/industrial activities and/or rendering services in Macau SAR, the resultant gain from such commercial/industrial activities and/or services rendered will be subject to complementary tax.
