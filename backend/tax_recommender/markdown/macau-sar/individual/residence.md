Residence and/or domicile are irrelevant for Macau Professional Tax purposes.
A taxpayer who is a resident of a country with which Macau SAR has a bilateral tax agreement or tax arrangement will have to refer to the relevant article of such agreement/arrangement to determine oneâ€™s liability to professional tax. _See the section for a list of countries with which Macau SAR has a bilateral tax agreement or tax arrangement_.
