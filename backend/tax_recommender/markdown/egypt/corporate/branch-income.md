## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Branches of foreign corporations operating in Egypt receive tax treatment identical to that of corporate entities for the results of their activities in Egypt.
A branch, but not a subsidiary, may deduct a 'head office charge' of an amount of up to 10% of its taxable income.
According to law no. 53 of 2014, which imposed WHT on dividend payments, a PE's profits will be deemed dividend payments (and thus subject to 10% WHT according to law no. 199 of 2020, such rate is updated from the previous 5% WHT) if not repatriated within 60 days of the following financial year-end.
