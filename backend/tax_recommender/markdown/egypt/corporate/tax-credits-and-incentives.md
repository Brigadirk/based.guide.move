## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Egypt offers no specific tax incentives unless a company is a free zone entity, which is considered tax exempt for the permitted and licensed activities, or an entity that is established under the special economic zones law.
Certain incentives may be provided under the investment law for certain and specific types of activities.
## Foreign tax credit
The foreign tax paid by a resident company on its profits earned abroad is deductible from the tax payable in Egypt; however, losses incurred abroad are not deductible.
