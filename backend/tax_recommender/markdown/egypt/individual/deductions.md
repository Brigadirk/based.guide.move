## Personal deductions
### Insurance expenses
Premiums of life and health insurance on the taxpayer, in one’s favour or in favour of one’s spouse or minor children, and any insurance premiums for pension entitlement, provided that the insurance policy is concluded with an insurance firm registered with the Egyptian Insurance Supervisory Authority, are deductible.
The total deductible amount for the employees' contribution to the private insurance funds, the premiums of life and health insurance, and the insurance premiums for pension entitlement cannot exceed 15% of the net revenue or EGP 10,000, whichever is lower. No further deduction of the same contributions and premiums should be repeated from any other industrial, commercial or non-commercial, or real estate income.

There are no family allowances in Egypt.
