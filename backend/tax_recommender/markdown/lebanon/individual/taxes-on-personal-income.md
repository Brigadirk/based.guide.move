Based on the 2022 Budget Law, the brackets for the progressive payroll tax rates are between 2% and 25%, on annual payroll tax brackets between LL 18 million and LL 675 million instead of annual payroll tax brackets between LL 6 million and LL 225 million effective 1 January 2022.

## Tax on capital gains and investment income
A new Law no. 64, dated 26 October 2017, introduced new tax measures related to the capital gains on disposal of real estate (not other types of fixed assets) that is taxed at 15% instead of 10% (not applicable for individuals on up to two principal residences and if owned more than 12 years).
The 2022 Budget Law imposed a transfer tax, 3% for resident individuals and 5% for non-resident individuals, on capital gains realised by individuals on the disposal of shares in companies in case the disposed shares are shares of one of the following joint stock companies:
  * Companies whose primary activity is the acquisition of built and unbuilt real estate properties;
  * Companies who engage in the trading and development of built and unbuilt real estate properties; or
  * Companies that have more than 50% of their fixed assets as real estate properties


The gain from the disposal is the difference between the cost of acquiring the share and the actual disposal price.
The individual shareholder benefits from a 50% discount on the tax due if the transfer of shares is between the shareholders themselves or within the parents/children. Individual shareholders benefit from a full exemption of the tax due when they dispose of their shares in the remaining joint stock companies.
Moreover, Decision no. 323 issued 15 May 2023, addressed the tax treatment of income from disposal of shares realised by an individual as follows: 
  * 10% Movable capital tax when the shares disposed of are shares of Lebanese or foreign Limited Liability Company
  * Income Tax at progressive rates when the disposal of shares represents a commercial transaction for the resident individual 
  * Exempt from tax when the shares disposed of are shares of foreign Joint Stock Company 
  * Exempt from tax when the shares disposed of are not part of any of the above mentioned scenarios
