## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Foreign tax relief
Resident taxpayers can credit foreign income taxes against their Japanese national tax and local inhabitant’s tax liabilities (with certain limitations), where foreign-source income is taxed in Japan. Non-resident taxpayers are not entitled to take foreign tax credits on their Japan income tax returns unless they have a permanent establishment (PE) in Japan.

Notes
  1. These jurisdictions have tax conventions in Japan that were formed primarily to eliminate double taxation and prevent tax evasion and avoidance. 73 conventions cover 80 jurisdictions. The number of tax conventions is not equal to the number of jurisdictions due to multiple cases where conventions were succeeded by multiple jurisdictions.
  2. These jurisdictions are in a tax information exchange agreement with Japan that was formed primarily to exchange information regarding tax matters. 11 conventions cover 11 jurisdictions.
  3. These jurisdictions are signatories of the Convention of Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and have bilateral agreements with Japan. Out of the 142 jurisdictions who are a part of this multilateral agreement, 79 have formed bilateral agreements with Japan.
  4. The government of Japan does not have an international agreement with the government of Taiwan; however, a private-sector tax agreement is in place between the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association of Japan and the Taiwan-Japan Relations Association of Taiwan.


### Mutual Administrative Assistance
Japan is a signatory to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which is currently in effect.
### Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Agreement
On 7 June 2017, Japan signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, which will not take effect until the instrument of ratification is submitted. As of 11 June 2024, this treaty is in effect in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
### Totalisation agreements
Designed to avoid overlaps in social security enrolment, Japan has entered into social security agreements with several countries. This agreement has two effects, which are the following:
  1. Prevention of double enrolment: Social insurance systems are coordinated to prevent dual enrolment.
  2. Totalisation of period of pension participation: The period of pension participation is summed between the two countries so that it is easier for insured persons to meet the requirements for the period of participation needed to receive pension benefits.


As of June 2024, the agreements currently in effect are with Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agreements with China, Italy, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom include ‘elimination of dual coverage’ only.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Individual income tax
### Implementation of new measures for significantly high individual income (minimum tax)
An additional tax burden will be imposed on individuals who have a significantly high level of income. Specifically, if the minimum tax (threshold) calculated based on the following formula (i) is greater than the individual’s income tax liability for the year (ii), such excess (i.e. [i] minus [ii]) will be added to the income tax liability for the year:
Threshold: 22.5% x (standard taxable income - 330 million Japanese yen [JPY])
For example, where income in a given year is only capital gains with the amount of JPY 3 billion (subject to separate taxation at a rate of 15.315% including surtax), the excess of 140 million (JPY 600 million minus JPY 460 million, _as illustrated below_) will be levied as an additional tax liability.
  1. (JPY 3 billion - JPY 330 million) x 22.5% = approximately JPY 600 million
  2. JPY 3 billion × 15.315% = approximately JPY 460 million


This revision will apply to individual income tax for tax year 2025 onwards.
## Inheritance tax and gift tax
The two revisions below will be applied to the inheritance tax on assets acquired by gift on or after 1 January 2024.
### Revision to the taxation system for settling gift taxes at the time of inheritance
Under the current rule, if assets are gifted to an heir of a decedent and the special measures for settlement at the time of inheritance apply, the value of the gifted assets as of the time of the gift is added to the value of inherited assets and is subject to the inheritance tax. The gift tax already paid at the time of the gift is deducted from the inheritance tax. Under this special measure, a special deduction of JPY 25 million is applied in calculating the taxable amount of the gift tax.
Under the 2023 tax reform, an additional special deduction of JPY 1.1 million will be available in addition to the previous special deductions of JPY 25 million. 
### Add-back period for gifts received prior to inheritance
Under the current inheritance tax law, the value of the assets acquired by heir(s) by way of gift from the decedent within three years prior to the inheritance should be added back to the taxable amount of the inheritance. 
Under the 2023 tax reform, the add-back period of three years will be extended to seven years, and a deduction of JPY 1 million will be applied in calculating the taxable amount of the inheritance. Note that if the assets are acquired by gift within three years prior to the inheritance, this deduction of JPY 1 million is not applicable.


# Japan
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
In Japan, permanent resident taxpayers are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident taxpayers are taxed only on their Japan-sourced income. Non-permanent resident taxpayers are taxed on their income other than foreign-source income (in particular, potentially, on certain capital gains) that are not remitted into Japan plus potentially part of their foreign-sourced income that is paid in or remitted to Japan.
## Personal income tax rates
The current national income tax rates are:
Taxable income (JPY) | Tax rate (%) | Deduction | Tax on Column 1 (JPY)  
---|---|---|---  
Over (Column 1) | Not over  
0 | 1,950,000 | 5 | 0 | 0  
1,950,000 | 3,300,000 | 10 | 97,500 | 97,500  
3,300,000 | 6,950,000 | 20 | 427,500 | 232,500  
6,950,000 | 9,000,000 | 23 | 636,000 | 962,500  
9,000,000 | 18,000,000 | 33 | 1,536,000 | 1,434,000  
18,000,000 | 40,000,000 | 40 | 2,796,000 | 4,404,000  
40,000,000 | 45 | 4,796,000 | 13,204,000  
_The tax liability is determined by multiplying the excess taxable income for each bracket by the percentage above and adding the cumulative tax figure (see the_ _section for more information_).
## Surtaxes
A surtax took effect 1 January 2013. The surtax consists of a 2.1% tax that is assessed on an individual’s national income tax.
## Local income taxes
Generally, in Japan, the local inhabitant’s tax is imposed at a flat rate of 10%. Japanese local governments (prefectural and municipal governments) levy local inhabitant’s tax on a taxpayer’s prior year income. This applies when the taxpayer is a resident of Japan as of January 1 of the current year. For local inhabitant’s tax purposes, an equalisation _per capita_ tax is also assessed. The standard annual amount is JPY 5,000, although this may vary based on the prefecture and municipality in which the taxpayer resides. Local inhabitant’s tax is not deductible.
## Non-residents
A non-resident taxpayer’s Japan-source compensation (employment income) is subject to a flat 20.42% national income tax on gross compensation with no deductions available. This rate includes 2.1% of the surtax described above (20% × 102.1% = 20.42%). A non-resident taxpayer may be subject to the local inhabitant’s tax at a rate of 10% if they are registered as a resident on the local municipality ledger as of 1 January of the following year.


# Japan
## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Taxable period
The Japanese individual income tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
All income tax returns are filed on an individual basis in Japan; joint tax returns are not permitted. The tax year is the calendar year for all resident-status individuals, and a taxpayer is required to file a national tax return by 15 March of the following year. If the due date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be the due date.
If a taxpayer’s income consists only of employment income paid by one local employer (including a Japanese branch of a foreign corporation) and does not exceed JPY 20 million in a year, the payer of the income makes a ‘year-end adjustment’ on the employment income, and if total income other than employment income is JPY 200,000 or less, the employee is not required to file a national income tax return. However, a local prefectural and inhabitant's tax return has to be filed to the extent the taxpayer has income other than employment income.
### Overseas assets reporting
Tax permanent residents of Japan who own assets outside of Japan that exceed JPY 50 million in value as of 31 December of the year must disclose such assets by submitting the Report of Foreign Assets by 30 June of the following year. If the due date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be the due date.
### Assets and liabilities reporting
Global asset and liability reporting is required for resident taxpayers who have worldwide assets with a total market value of JPY 1 billion or more as of 31 December and for taxpayers who have total income (other than retirement income) on the tax return exceeding JPY 20 million and hold (i) worldwide assets with a gross fair value of JPY 300 million or more, or (ii) financial assets subject to the exit tax of JPY 100 million or more as of 31 December. Individuals meeting these conditions will need to report, in detail, their worldwide assets and liabilities on the Report of Assets and Liabilities form. These reports are not a part of the income tax return and need to be filed separately with the tax office by 30 June of the following year. If the due date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be the due date.
## Payment of tax
If salary is paid in Japan by a local employer, monthly withholding of national income tax is required. The national tax due on overseas payments of salary is payable when the tax return is filed, rather than through payroll withholding. Please note that the overseas payment of salary is deemed to be paid in Japan and subject to WHT if the payer has a residence, business entity, or a PE in Japan. Two provisional payments of national tax may be required in July and November if the previous year’s final tax liability (after the deduction of WHT) was JPY 150,000 or more.
Local inhabitant's tax is assessed on the prior year’s income if a taxpayer is registered as a tax resident as of 1 January of the current year. The tax is paid on a four-instalment basis (i.e. in June, August, October, and January of the following year) or withheld from monthly salary from June through May of the following year if the salary is paid in Japan.
## Tax audit process
The tax authority of Japan is the National Tax Agency, and individual tax audits are conducted by the tax office where the individual resides and cover the previous three to five years.
## Statute of limitations
The standard statute of limitations under audit is currently five years; however, this can be extended in cases of tax evasion.
From tax year 2020, an additional three-year statute of limitation is applied when a taxpayer does not produce supporting documents related to overseas transactions or overseas assets by the due date set forth by tax auditors (no more than 60 days from the date of request) when the National Tax Agency requests a treaty country for information related to overseas transactions or overseas assets; except in the following circumstances:
  * The additional three-year statute of limitation does not apply when the request to the treaty country is made when the remaining period until the original statute of limitation is six months or less.
  * The additional three-year statute of limitation only applies when the National Tax Agency informs the taxpayer about the request to a treaty country within three months from the date of such request.


## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The topics covered under tax audits can be wide ranging and varied and will largely depend on the individual taxpayer.


# Japan
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
## Personal deductions
Interest is not tax deductible. Japanese social security contributions are fully deductible. Medical expenses (irrespective of where they were paid) are tax deductible, with certain limitations.
### Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions designated by the Ministry of Finance in Japan are tax deductible, with certain limitations (generally, only charities in Japan qualify). Qualified contributions or donations that total, in aggregate, over JPY 2,000 are deductible in computing the national tax. The total deduction is limited to 40% of income, less JPY 2,000. The definition of a qualified contribution is extremely restrictive (_see the section for more information_).
### Life insurance premiums
Life insurance (or private pension) premiums paid to a Japanese agency in local currency are deductible to a limited extent in computing national and local inhabitant’s taxes.
Earthquake insurance premiums are also deductible for the purpose of both national and local inhabitant’s tax to a limited extent.
## Earned income deduction
A permanent and/or non-permanent resident employee can take an earned income deduction, computed by applying an appropriate rate to gross employment income as follows (the minimum standard deduction is JPY 550,000 or gross employment income, whichever is lower). The deduction is currently capped at JPY 1.95 million.
Employment income (JPY) | Formula for exclusion amount calculation | Salary income exclusion (JPY)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 1,625,000 | 550,000  
1,625,000 | 1,800,000 | 40% of employment income - 100,000 | 550,000 minimum, up to 620,000  
1,800,000 | 3,600,000 | 30% of employment income + 80,000 | 620,000 minimum, up to 1,160,000  
3,600,000 | 6,600,000 | 20% of employment income + 440,000 | 1,160,000 minimum, up to 1,760,000  
6,600,000 | 8,500,000 | 10% of employment income + 1,100,000 | 1,760,000 minimum, up to 1,950,000  
8,500,000 | 1,950,000  
## Personal exemptions
From tax year 2020, resident taxpayers are entitled to a personal exemption for both national income tax and local inhabitants tax purposes based on their total income during the tax year, as follows:
Total income (JPY) | Personal exemption for national income tax (JPY) | Personal exemption for local inhabitants tax (JPY)  
---|---|---  
Under 24 million | 480,000 | 430,000  
Over 24 million and under 24.5 million | 320,000 | 290,000  
Over 24.5 million and under 25 million | 160,000 | 150,000  
Over 25 million | Not eligible | Not eligible  
In the case of a non-dependent spouse, a special spouse exemption (a maximum JPY 380,000 and JPY 330,000 for national income tax purposes and local inhabitant’s tax purposes) can be taken, depending on the spouse’s income, by taxpayers whose income amount does not exceed JPY 10 million.
Resident taxpayers are allowed a deduction for each dependant who is 16 years old or older. A dependant is a relative, other than a spouse, who is supported by the taxpayer provided that the dependant’s income does not exceed JPY 480,000 for the year. The dependant is not required to live with the taxpayer but should receive support from the taxpayer as part of the taxpayer’s household. The amount of the deduction increases if the dependant is aged 70 or older at the end of the year or is at least 19 years old but less than 23 years old. For each category of dependants, the deductions also increase if the dependant has a disability.
In general, a non-resident taxpayer is not eligible for any of these deductions.
## Business deductions
Business expenses are tax deductible in some limited cases. An employer’s reimbursements of business expenses, such as commuting, travel, and entertainment expenses, do not constitute taxable income to the employee, provided the expenses are required for the employer’s business.
A self-employed taxpayer is allowed to claim business expenses against income, provided it can be substantiated that the expenses are necessary.
## Losses
With effect from 1 January 2016, capital losses arising from the sale of publicly traded shares and specified bonds (‘publicly traded investments group’) through a qualified Japanese broker will be offset against dividends from publicly traded shares and interest from specified bonds, provided separate taxation by filing is elected.
Under the current tax law, capital losses through sales from a qualified Japanese broker within a publicly traded investments group after offset against dividends from publicly offered shares and interest from bonds or bond funds may be carried over for three years.

# Japan
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
Gross income consists of all forms of taxable income (e.g. income from employment, investment, rental real estate).
## Employment income
Salary, bonuses, stock or share-based income, foreign-service premiums, cost-of-living allowances, tax reimbursements, and other benefits in kind (except for certain tax-exempt items) are classified as taxable remuneration (employment income). Japan-source employment income is remuneration earned for services rendered in Japan, regardless of where or when the remuneration is paid.
Reasonable relocation expenses, including expenses for a spouse and children, that are borne by the employer do not constitute taxable income. A reasonable amount of airfare for home leave, including airfare for family members travelling together with the employee, may generally be not taxable.
Where an employer provides housing, the amount of the taxable benefit is determined based on a formula, and, provided the housing arrangements are structured properly, only a percentage of the rent paid is generally treated as taxable.
In the case of housing provided for a director (a board member) of a domestic or foreign company, the taxable value would generally be 50% (35% if it can be substantiated that the house is also used for business purposes by the employer) of the actual rent. However, if the housing provided by the company is considered unnecessarily luxurious, the market rent may be deemed to be the taxable value.
Retirement or severance income is treated preferentially under the current Japan tax law. However, retirement payments that are approved by a company’s shareholders and are to be made to a director of the company are only eligible for preferential tax treatment if the individual has served as a director for a period of more than five years. This five-year service period must have been with the same company.
## Equity compensation
For directors and employees, income arising from the exercise of stock options is generally taxed at the date of exercise (fair market value at exercise - exercise price) while income from restricted stock units is taxable at the point of vesting. Income arising from certain qualified stock options (qualified for Japan tax purposes) is not taxable at exercise but is taxed instead as a capital gain when the stocks received at exercise are sold, if certain conditions are met. The point of taxation of equity compensation will depend on the specifics of the plan.
In general, for residents, income derived from the exercise of an employee stock option issued by a non-Japanese company is treated as employment income and subject to Japanese national and local inhabitant’s tax at the graduated income tax rates. In addition, gains from the sale of the equity acquired are subject to income tax at 15.315% national and 5% local tax (if the individual is a tax resident) unless certain other conditions are met.
## Business income
If taxpayers engage in their own business, a business enterprise tax will be levied on their business income by the local prefectural government. Business enterprise tax is deductible for the calculation of business income. In general, business enterprise tax is assessed on business income in excess of JPY 2.9 million at a rate of 3%, 4%, or 5%, depending on the type of business.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are, in principle, aggregated with other income after deductions for necessary expenses and after a statutory deduction of a maximum of JPY 500,000.
If the transferred assets were owned for more than five years, the gain is regarded as a long-term capital gain, and the taxable basis is reduced to 50% of the net capital gain.
Capital gains from sales of real property (land, building and structures) are taxed separately from other sources of income. Gains on property that had been held for over five years as of 1 January of the year when the transfer was made are considered long-term capital gains and are taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax). Gains on property that was held for five years or less are classified as short-term capital gains and are taxed at a flat rate of 39.63% (30.63% national tax + 9% local inhabitant’s tax).
Capital gains from sales of certain securities (including shares and equity interest in corporations, warrant bonds, etc.) are taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax).
Listed shares are shares listed on Japanese or foreign stock exchanges and government bonds, etc. Unlisted shares are shares other than listed shares as indicated above.
Capital gains or losses arising from the sale of listed shares cannot be used to offset capital losses or gains arising from the sale of unlisted shares.
## Dividend income
In principle, dividends are taxed at graduated rates after being aggregated with other sources of income. However, dividends paid by corporations listed on an exchange can optionally be taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax). Certain capital losses may be used to absorb dividend income (_see Losses in the section for more information_). If paid by Japanese corporations, dividends are subject to withholding tax (WHT).
## Interest income
Interest on domestic bank deposits and/or certain designated financial instruments is taxed separately from other income and is subject to 20.315% WHT (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax) if paid onshore. Interest paid by offshore financial institutions is taxed at graduated rates. Interest on bonds listed on an exchange is taxed at a flat rate of 20.315% (15.315% national tax + 5% local inhabitant’s tax).
## Rental income
Rental income consists of gross rent received in connection with the letting of real estate to either an individual or commercial tenant. To arrive at the taxable amount, any allowable expenses and depreciation are deducted from the gross income. To the extent a taxpayer has a net rental loss excluding loss generated from offshore real estate, this loss can be used to offset other types of income. Note that mortgage interest payments allocable to the ownership of land can’t be used to offset other types of non-rental income.
## Non-resident’s income
Assuming the non-resident does not have a permanent establishment (PE) in Japan, a non-resident’s income from Japan-source interest, dividends, rental income, and royalties is generally subject to tax at a rate of 20.42% (15.315% in the case of interest on bank deposits, certain designated financial instruments, and/or dividends on listed shares) or lower treaty rates through WHT at source. A tax return must subsequently be filed to report rental income and determine the final tax liability.

For local tax purposes, contributions made to the Community Chest, the Japan Red Cross, any prefecture and city (or municipality), and groups approved by each prefecture and city (or municipality) under their respective regulations qualify as creditable charitable contributions. Aggregated charitable contributions in excess of JPY 2,000 are deductible, subject to a cap of 40% of the gross taxable amount.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 24 January 2025
A resident taxpayer is an individual taxpayer (i) who has a ‘ _jusho_ ’ (i.e. a residence) in Japan; or (ii) who has maintained a ‘ _kyosho_ ’ (i.e. a temporary place of abode) in Japan for a period of one year or more. A resident taxpayer who is not a Japanese national and who has an aggregate stay in Japan of five years or less within the preceding ten years (60 months within the preceding 120 months) would be classified as a non-permanent resident taxpayer. If a resident taxpayer is a Japanese national, or a foreign national with an aggregate stay in Japan of more than five years within the preceding ten years, the taxpayer is considered a permanent resident taxpayer.

## Social security contributions
An employee whose salary or bonus, including fringe benefits, is paid in Japan by a local employer (including a Japanese branch of a foreign corporation) is generally liable to pay a share of social insurance premiums. The employee’s share consists of the following contributions:
Contribution | Standard premiums on monthly salary | Standard premiums on bonuses  
---|---|---  
Health insurance for the Metropolis of Tokyo (each prefecture has its own health insurance rate, and rates are slightly higher for individuals from the age of 40 to the age of 64) (1) | 4.99% (on a maximum of JPY 1,390,000 of wages per month) | 4.99% (on an annual cap of JPY 5.73 million of irregular annual total payments)  
Welfare pension (2)  | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 650,000 of wages per month) | 9.15% (on a maximum of JPY 1.5 million of irregular payments per month)  
Unemployment insurance (3) | 0.60% | 0.60%  
Total | 14.75% | 14.75%  
Note
  1. The fixed rate of 4.99% (previously 5.00%) for health insurance applies from March 2024. Simultaneously, the fixed rate of 0.80% (previously 0.91%) for long-term care insurance also applies from March 2024. Long-term care insurance is required for individuals from the age of 40 to the age of 64.

## Consumption taxes
A consumption tax is levied when a business enterprise transfers goods, provides services, or imports goods into Japan. As of 1 April 2014, the applicable rate is 8% (previously 5%). As of 1 October 2019, the rate will increase to 10% (for certain foods, drinks, and newspapers, the tax rate will remain as 8%). Exports and certain services to non-residents are not taxed. Specified transactions, such as sales or leases of land, sales of securities, and provision of public services, are not subject to taxation. Consumption tax paid by a business enterprise attributable to taxable revenue shall be refundable by filing the consumption tax return to the extent that such transaction is recorded in the books of account and relevant invoices are kept.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are currently no net wealth/worth taxes in Japan.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Inheritance tax is a national tax imposed on the recipients of an inheritance.
The transfer of overseas assets between foreign nationals who have had a 'Jusho' ( tax residency determined based on the family, business, days staying in Japan, asset location) in Japan for less than ten out of the last 15 years with a visa issued under Table 1 of the Visa Status Table of Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act ('temporary foreigners') and other temporary foreigners or with non-Japanese nationals outside of Japan is exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax. Note, however, that the transfer of overseas assets between non-Japanese nationals and Japanese nationals who currently have a 'Jusho' or have had a 'Jusho' in Japan within the previous ten years is not exempt.
To qualify for the above exemption, foreign nationals need to meet the definition of temporary foreigners. The foreign national has to (i) have had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan for not more than ten out of the past 15 years looking back from the date of death/gift and (ii) hold a visa issued under Table 1. Foreign nationals who satisfy (i), but fail to satisfy (ii) (i.e. who hold a visa issued under Table 2), are not considered temporary foreigners and are therefore subject to worldwide taxation of Japan gift and inheritance tax while residing in Japan, regardless of whom the transfers are made with.
Note that a Table 1 visa under the Visa Status Table of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act includes work-related visas and does not include the following visa types: permanent resident, spouse or child of a Japanese national, spouse or child of a permanent resident, and long-term resident.
The transfer of overseas assets to a Japanese national heir or donee who is not a resident of Japan but who has had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance is subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax. If a Japanese national heir or donee has not had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance, they will not be subject to tax so long as the decedent or donor is a foreign national. Similarly, the transfer of overseas assets from a Japanese national decedent or donor who is not a resident of Japan but had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan within the ten years prior to the gift or inheritance is also subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax.
Effective 1 April 2021, the Japan gift and inheritance tax laws were updated to further narrow the scope or applicability for foreign nationals. The transfer of overseas assets from foreign nationals, regardless of the length of their period of residence in Japan, to ‘temporary foreigners’ or non-Japanese nationals outside of Japan is exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax if the foreign national transferor holds a Table 1 visa.
This updated exemption and disregard to the length of period of residence in Japan does not apply to foreign national resident recipients of gifts and inheritances of overseas assets. Foreign national resident recipients still need to have had a ‘Jusho’ in Japan for no more than ten of the past 15 years and hold a Table 1 visa in order to be considered ‘temporary foreigners’ and be exempt from Japan gift and inheritance tax on overseas assets received from foreign national transferors. Also, to clarify and confirm, the updated law does not provide an exemption on the transfer of overseas assets if either the foreign national resident transferor or transferee holds a Table 2 visa. This is unchanged.
Note that any transfers of assets located in Japan are always subject to Japan gift and inheritance tax, regardless of whom the transfers are between or when the transfers take place.
Assets subject to inheritance tax include tangible, intangible, real, or personal property, unless otherwise specifically exempt under the law. Assets are valued in accordance with the provisions of the Japanese tax rules. The same rules apply to the gift tax system.
The basic exemption is JPY 30 million plus JPY 6 million per statutory heir. If the gross estate is smaller than the total amount of the basic exemption, there is no filing requirement.
After any exemptions are applied, the total amount of inheritance tax is determined as follows. First, the assets are allocated to individuals (referred to as statutory heirs) in accordance with the statutory inheritance proportions. Then, the graduated inheritance tax rates are applied to each statutory heir’s portion. Each statutory heir’s portion is then added together to ascertain the total inheritance tax on the assets. Then, this tax is allocated based on the actual recipient(s) of the assets (this allocation is generally based on the deceased’s will). If there is no will left behind, the statutory heirs decide how to divide the assets. The actual recipient will be liable for the tax payment, and the tax credit (if any) will apply to the actual taxpayer’s liabilities. In summary, a will executed in the home country of the deceased will generally be respected; however, the total amount of tax is always calculated in accordance with the inheritance proportions for each statutory heir.
Gift tax is a national tax levied on the recipients of a gift. The scope of gift tax is similar to the scope of inheritance tax in that a taxpayer’s visa type and the time they have resided inside and outside of Japan affects which gifts may be subject to gift tax. However, the gift tax regime is not unified with inheritance tax, with the exception of gifts made within seven years (within three years for gifts made on or before 31 December 2023) prior to the death of the donor.
The annual gift tax exemption per recipient is JPY 1.1 million. Any amount of gift(s) received above the exemption will potentially be subject to Japan gift tax.
Additionally, there is a special system where the taxpayer can make an irrevocable election to integrate inheritance and gift tax when certain conditions are met.
Under the special system, referred to as 'settlement of taxes at the time of inheritance':
  * Qualified transfers are those from lineal ascendants who are aged 60 years and older made to their lineal descendants who are aged 18 years or older.
  * Gifts of up to a total of JPY 25 million are exempt from gift tax. Several gifts can be made tax-free as long as the total gifts do not exceed the JPY 25 million threshold.
  * Gifts are taxed at a rate of 20% on the amount exceeding the accumulated threshold of JPY 25 million. The amount of gift tax, if any, will be treated as a prepayment of tax against a future inheritance tax liability.
  * Valuation of the gifted assets will freeze at the time of the gift for the inheritance tax calculation.
  * Those who made this election will automatically be subject to the inheritance tax filing regardless of the situation at the time of inheritance.
