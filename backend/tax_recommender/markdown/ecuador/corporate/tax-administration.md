## Tax returns
The tax system operates on the basis of self-assessment, with subsequent inspection by the tax authorities.
Tax filing deadlines begin on 9 April and continue up to 28 April. The tax return due dates are determined by the ninth digit of the companyâ€™s Tax Identification Number (TIN) and taxpayer classification defined by the tax authority.

In general terms, most companies are required to keep accounting records and are allowed to make voluntary CIT prepayments based on the following calculation: 50% of the previous year CIT due less income tax withholding applied in such fiscal year.
The final CIT payment is due between 9 April and 28 April.
