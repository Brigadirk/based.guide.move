## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Dividends paid to non-resident entities are generally subject to WHT.
The WHT rate upon dividend distribution is 25% over 40% of the distributed amount, or 37% if the Ecuadorian company has not duly disclosed its ownership structure before the Ecuadorian tax authorities.
Revenues from occasional services provided by non-resident individuals are levied at 25% WHT. Payments made abroad to non-resident individuals and companies are subject to a 25% WHT. Other payments made abroad, other than dividends or profits to neutral jurisdictions, are subject to a 25% WHT.
The Internal Revenue Service of Ecuador establishes WHT percentages on local payments, which are not greater than 10%. Current rates are 1%, 1.75%, 2%, 2.75%, 8%, and 10% withholding. Specifically:
  * Dividend payments to resident companies are subject to a 0% WHT.
  * Dividend payments to resident individuals are subject to WHT up to 25%.
  * Interest payments to resident companies are subject to a 0% to 2% WHT.
  * Interest payments to resident individuals are subject to a 2% WHT.
  * Royalty payments to resident companies are subject to an 8% WHT.
  * Royalty payments to resident individuals are subject to an 8% WHT.


The tax administration will appoint the taxpayers that must act as income tax withholding agents via Resolution.
## Tax treaties
Benefits from tax treaties can be applied automatically from 29 November 2021 onwards, according to the latest tax reform (treaty benefits were previously limited to a specific amount of USD 560,000 per year and supplier, the WHT on the excess was subject to refund by the tax authority).
As a member of the Andean Community, Ecuador has adopted Decision 578, which provides relief from double taxation for individual or company members. Furthermore, Ecuador has similar tax treaties with the countries provided in the table below.
