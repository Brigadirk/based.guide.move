Corporate residence is determined by the place of incorporation. For foreign branches, it is the place stated in the domiciliary deed.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to the local tax legislation, a company can be deemed to have a PE in Ecuador if it maintains any place or fixed centre, within the country, in which a foreign company develops all or part of its activities.
The corresponding regulations point out that a PE also exists when a foreign company maintains, within the country, a person or an entity that acts on its behalf and habitually exercises an economic activity. It contemplates several instances where this is applicable, among them:
  * A person with legal representation, which is normally granted through a power of attorney or through a legalised decision by the company and includes the capacity to legally act on behalf of the company.
  * A person working under a contractual relationship for a foreign company to carry out economic activities on behalf of that company.
  * A centre for the direction of the activities of the foreign company.
  * A branch, agency, or office that acts on behalf of the foreign company.
  * An office for the provision of technical consultancy services related to contracts that are executed in the country.
