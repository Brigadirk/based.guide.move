## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Taxable period
The fiscal year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The tax system operates on the basis of self-assessment, with subsequent inspection by the tax authorities.
Tax filing deadlines begin on 9 April and continue up to 28 April. The tax return due dates are determined by the ninth digit of the company’s Tax Identification Number (TIN) and taxpayer classification defined by the tax authority.
## Payment of tax
Local tax authorities have established that for CIT purposes, and its pre-payments, companies are obligated to follow IFRS accounting principles.
In general terms, most companies are required to keep accounting records and are allowed to make voluntary CIT prepayments based on the following calculation: 50% of the previous year CIT due less income tax withholding applied in such fiscal year.
The final CIT payment is due between 9 April and 28 April.
### Self-withholding applicable to major taxpayers
As of January 2024, major taxpayers duly qualified by the IRS are required to file and pay self-withholding income tax based on their monthly taxable income. Percentage is determined by the IRS for each taxpayer through resolution and may vary from 1% to 10%. 
## Tax audit process
In general terms, tax authorities look at the consistency of the information delivered by the taxpayers and information reported by third parties. Tax authorities can issue communications in order to require explanations on any detected inconsistency. Additionally, accounting inspections can be performed.
## Statute of limitations
Fiscal authorities have four years from the date of filing to start proceedings for tax audits or assessment and collection of taxes.
The statute of limitations is extended from four to six years if the corresponding tax returns have not been filed. A tax audit can be reopened, verified, or amended within one year from the date of completion.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Tax authorities usually focus on substance, formal compliance requirements, and consistency of information filed.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Corporate residence is determined by the place of incorporation. For foreign branches, it is the place stated in the domiciliary deed.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
According to the local tax legislation, a company can be deemed to have a PE in Ecuador if it maintains any place or fixed centre, within the country, in which a foreign company develops all or part of its activities.
The corresponding regulations point out that a PE also exists when a foreign company maintains, within the country, a person or an entity that acts on its behalf and habitually exercises an economic activity. It contemplates several instances where this is applicable, among them:
  * A person with legal representation, which is normally granted through a power of attorney or through a legalised decision by the company and includes the capacity to legally act on behalf of the company.
  * A person working under a contractual relationship for a foreign company to carry out economic activities on behalf of that company.
  * A centre for the direction of the activities of the foreign company.
  * A branch, agency, or office that acts on behalf of the foreign company.

As a general rule, payments on operations that exceed USD 500 should be made through an institution of the financial system; otherwise, such operations will become non-deductible.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Straight-line depreciation applies at rates specified by law. The Director of the Internal Revenue Service (_Servicio de Rentas Internas_ or IRS) of Ecuador can authorise higher depreciation rates in cases such as obsolescence, excessive use, and faster than expected wear-out of assets.
Annual depreciation rates are as follows:
Asset | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Real estate (except land), aircraft, naval crafts, and similar property | 5  
Facilities, machinery, equipment, and furniture | 10

Computer equipment and software | 33.33  
Depreciation rates apply to the cost of assets.
In the case of vehicles, if, at the time of purchase of the vehicle, its appraisal exceeds USD 35,000, the deductions for depreciation, leasing payments, interests paid for the acquisition, and vehicle property taxes will not be allowed. Some exceptions apply.
Intangible assets are amortised either within the terms specified in the contract or over a 20-year period.
## Goodwill
Goodwill cannot be amortised in Ecuador, but there are limited exceptions.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
Organisation, experimentation, and pre-operational expenses can be amortised over five years at the rate of 20% per year.
## Interest expenses
Interest on debts incurred for business purposes are deductible.
In general, foreign loan interests are deductible for CIT purposes to the extent that the credits are registered before the ECB and the interest rates do not exceed the referential rates established by the ECB.
Interest paid on loans obtained from non-resident financial institutions and other approved entities is deductible and not subject to withholding tax (WHT) unless the interest rate is higher than the referential interest rate established by the ECB. In such cases, the excess is subject to 25% WHT (_in all cases where a 25% WHT is applicable, please refer to the section for more information_).
Interest paid for loans granted by a non-registered related party are subject to WHT at 25% over the gross amount.

Advertising, pension plans, severance, travel, and foreign related-party expenses are subject to deductibility limits.
## Net operating losses
The carryforward of losses is allowed to a maximum of five years, with an amortisation limit of 25% per year over the taxable base. There is no loss carryback.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
In most cases, payments made abroad are deductible, as long as income taxes have been withheld (at the rate of 25% or 37% over the taxable base) and do not exceed some maximum limits. Professional fees, royalties, commissions, or any payment made abroad is subject to WHT at a rate of 25% or 37% over the taxable base. Payments on imports are deductible and not subject to WHT.

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in Ecuador.

The transfer pricing regime in Ecuador is based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Related-party transactions must be carried out at arm’s length. Formal documentation requirements exist.
A regulation has established the procedures to apply for an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) in regard to transfer pricing methods for related-party transactions. Accordingly, the taxpayer may submit a formal application for a binding rule.
## Thin capitalisation
A thin capitalisation rule applies for interest deductibility on loans granted by related parties equivalent to 20% of the fiscal year profit before taxes plus compulsory profit sharing, interest, depreciation, and amortisation expenses.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
A new tax regime for CFCs was introduced. Overall, a CFC is a non-resident entity that has: (i) at least one beneficial owner tax resident in Ecuador with an effective participation of 25% or more of the entity and (ii) an effective CIT rate lower than 15%.
Specific types of income obtained by the foreign entity will be attributable to the beneficial owner tax resident in Ecuador and, as such, must be included in the yearly income tax return. This regime is applicable as from 1 January 2024.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
Resident entities are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-resident entities are subject to tax on Ecuadorian-source income only.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are in force for all entities. Local tax authorities have established that for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes, and corresponding pre-payments, companies are obligated to follow these accounting principles.
Taxes on corporate income are levied at the following rates:
Type of income | CIT rate (%)  
---|---  
Distributed or undistributed profits of local corporations and branches | 22, 25, or 28  
Ecuadorian companies owned by residents or non-residents located in non-tax-haven jurisdictions are subject to a 22% or 25% CIT rate. The general CIT rate is 25%; however, a 28% rate should apply if non-resident shareholders are located in a tax haven jurisdiction and additionally there is an Ecuadorian individual shareholder in the ownership structure. Such increase is also applicable when the company's ownership structure is not duly disclosed before the Ecuadorian tax authorities.
A reduced CIT rate (from 3% to 5% benefit) exists for new investments to the extent some conditions are met.
_See the section for a list of countries and territories considered as tax havens by the tax authorities_.
## Temporary security contribution
Ecuadorian companies and permanent establishments (PEs) that obtained taxable income in the fiscal year 2022 are subjected to a 3.25% contribution, based on the taxable profits of such year. The deadline for the payment of the contribution is 31 March 2024 and 2025.
The contribution will not be deductible for income tax computation purposes, and the lack of payment within the deadline will result in a penalty equivalent to 3% of the obligation per month plus the corresponding interests.
## Temporary contribution on profits of banks and credit unions
A temporary contribution applies for banks and credit unions that are tax residents in Ecuador and obtained taxable profits in the 2023 fiscal year. The deadline for the payment is 31 May 2024.
The percentage rate varies on the taxable profits, from 5% (for profits below 5 million United States dollars [USD]) to 25% (for those exceeding USD 100 million).
The contribution will not be deductible for income tax purposes, and the lack of payment is subject to fines and penalties similar to the contribution for companies.
## Single income tax on sports betting operators _(Impuesto a la Renta Único a los Operadores de Pronósticos Deportivos)_
In June 2023, a new tax regime was created for sports resident and non-resident bet operators. Overall, a 15% CIT rate was established for these activities in effect as from July 2024. Below are some topics to be aware of:
  * Resident and non-resident operators must be registered before the tax authority.


  * The taxable income for resident and non-resident sports bet operators is the total income including commissions minus the total of the prizes paid, provided that withholding has been made at the time of payment of the prize to the customer.


  * Several sanctions are established for the lack of compliance of formal obligations.


## Local income taxes
No local or provincial government taxes on income are imposed on companies.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 06 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied at the rates of either 15% or 0% on the transfer of goods, import of goods, and the rendering of services, as well as on services rendered within the country or imported. Royalties and intangible property, imported or locally paid, are also levied with a 15% VAT.
The following transactions are exempt from VAT:
  * In-kind contributions to capital of companies.
  * Inheritance and assets obtained from liquidation of companies.
  * Transfers and transmissions of companies and commercial establishments under the terms established in the Commercial Code.
  * Mergers, spin-offs, and corporate transformations.
  * Donations to public entities and non-profit organisations.
  * Transfers of shares and securities.
  * Digital services used for the creation of national audio-visual content.
  * Goods and services contained in contracts performed within the Free Trade Zones.


Goods and services that are subject to the 0% rate are explicitly listed in the law.
Among others, the following goods are taxed at a 0% rate upon either importation or local transfer of ownership:
  * Most agricultural goods and foodstuff, when these remain in their natural state; this includes refrigerated or packaged goods that have not undergone further processing. Also included in this category are milk, meats, sugar, salt, bread, butter and margarine, flour, and cooking oil.
  * Drugs, medicines, masks, oximeters, alcohol, and antibacterial gel with a concentration of more than 70%, including raw materials for their production.
  * Fertilisers, insecticides, animal foods, and similar products, including the raw materials required for processing such goods.
  * Agricultural machinery and equipment.
  * Goods that are exported.
  * Paper and books.
  * Sanitary pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and popular disposable diapers.
  * Importation of fuels derived from hydrocarbons, biofuels, and their mixtures, including LPG and natural gas, destined for internal consumption.


Among others, the following services are taxed at a 0% rate:
  * Transportation of persons and cargo, except air transportation of persons and local air transportation of cargo.
  * Book printing services.
  * Housing rental.
  * Water, electric, sewage, and other public services, including garbage collection.
  * Exported services.
  * Education at all levels.


The 15% VAT paid on imports and local purchases can be deducted from the 15% VAT charged on sales or services rendered. VAT paid on raw materials, fixed assets, or components required for the production of goods or rendering of services is also creditable when the final product is considered taxable at 15%. Input VAT can be deducted/offset within a period of five years.
VAT paid on raw materials, services, components, or fixed assets necessary for production of export goods is recoverable.
The 15% VAT paid in the acquisition of goods and services utilised for the production or rendering of services levied at 0% VAT is not creditable. Therefore, it will be considered as part of the cost.
Companies appointed as 'special taxpayers' are required to withhold 30% and 70% of VAT paid on the purchase of goods and services, respectively. On purchases made to professionals, 100% VAT must be withheld. When the transaction is carried out between two ‘special taxpayers’, VAT withholding rates are reduced to 10% (goods) and 20% (services). The tax administration will appoint the taxpayers that must act as VAT withholding agents through a Resolution.
For importation of services, 15% VAT must be self-assessed and withheld at 100% by the local entity. This VAT is creditable.
Since 2020, the importation of digital services is levied with 15% VAT.
Exporters of services may request refund of input VAT.
Additionally, as of March 2024, the VAT rate for local transfers of construction materials is 5%.
## Customs duties
Since Ecuador is a member of the Andean Community, goods to be imported are classified under the Common Nomenclature of the Andean Countries participating in the Cartagena’s Agreement (NANDINA) Pact, which is based on the Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature (also known as the Brussels tariff nomenclature). Most consumer goods imports pay 25%, while intermediate goods are usually imported at a 10% or 15% rate. Raw materials and capital goods generally pay 0% to 5%. Ecuador has negotiated exceptions under the Andean common tariff that allow lower duties on certain capital goods and industrial inputs. There is duty-free import of agricultural goods and equipment.
The price listed on the commercial bill or invoice is the basis for the assessment of duties, except when the Ecuadorian Central Bank (ECB) considers the listed price unreasonable, in which case market prices in arm's-length transactions will be used. The burden of proof lies with the importer.
In addition to import duties, all imports are subject to 12% VAT and other minor taxes that do not exceed 1%. Charges are based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the merchandise.
All Ecuadorian imports and exports are subject to inspection by authorised international verification companies operating in the country (there are some imports exempt from verification). Goods are appraised for value, quantity, quality, and weight at the port of origin.
Since 2017, a commercial agreement between the European Union (EU) and Ecuador is in place, which provides relief on duties upon the importation of certain goods.
The Free Trade Zone regime is subjected to the following general regulations, among others:
  * Free Trade Zones are defined as geographical areas with special regimes for foreign trade, customs, taxation, finance, and agribusiness.
  * Goods entering from abroad are exempt from taxes and customs formalities.
  * The Free Trade Zone authorisation will have a minimum term of 30 years.
  * Income tax rate of 0% for five years and 15% for the term of the Free Trade Zone agreement.
  * Exemption from income tax on dividends paid by operators and users to their shareholders.
  * Users and operators may stabilise their income tax regime for five years, as long as they pay an additional 2% over the income tax rate applicable.


## Special consumption tax (_Impuesto a los Consumos Especiales_ or ICE)
ICE is imposed on domestic and imported goods that are explicitly listed in the law, including plastic bags and sugared, non-alcoholic, and carbonated drinks, among others. This tax is levied at a progressive rate from 5% to 35% on certain automobiles and 10% on airplanes, helicopters, and boats. The taxable basis on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages is obtained by the number of produced or imported cigarettes or degrees of alcohol, respectively.
## Foreign assets tax (_Impuesto a los Activos en el Exterior_)
The tax base for the foreign assets tax is the average monthly balance of cash deposits held in foreign entities by private entities registered in the stock market and regulated by the Superintendent of Banks and Companies. The monthly tax rate is 0.25% (0.37% for assets held in tax haven jurisdictions).
## Remittance tax (_Impuesto a la Salida de Divisas_)
Remittance tax is imposed on the transfer of money abroad in cash or through pay checks, transfers, or courier of any nature carried out with or without the mediation of the Ecuadorian financial system, including transfer from foreign bank accounts. Dividends and foreign loans may be exempt from this tax under certain considerations.
In January 2022, the remittance tax rate of 5% was reduced progressively. As of December 2023, the rate was 3.5%, expected to be reduced to 2% in 2024. Notwithstanding the above, as of 1 April 2024, the 5% rate was reintroduced.
## Stamp taxes
No stamp taxes are levied in Ecuador.
## Payroll taxes
There are no additional payroll taxes applicable other than Social Security contributions (_see below_).
## Social Security contributions
Employers and employees pay contributions to the Social Security at the rates of 12.15% and 9.45%, respectively, on the minimum monthly taxable wages as established for the different contributing categories by the Social Security. Such categories are revised annually.
## Labour profit sharing
Although it is not considered a tax, companies are obligated to pay 15% of their pre-tax earnings to their employees. This payment is considered a deductible expense for CIT computation purposes.
## Redeemable Tax on Non-Returnable Plastic Bottles
A tax is levied on the bottling of beverages in non-returnable plastic bottles utilised for containing alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, and water. In the case of imported beverages, this tax is levied upon their customs clearance.
For each plastic bottle levied with this tax, the rate is up to USD 0.02 per plastic bottle. This amount is fully reimbursed to whoever collects, delivers, and returns the bottles.
Taxpayers of this tax are the bottlers of drinks contained in plastic bottles and importers of drinks in plastic bottles.
Milk products and medicines filled in plastic bottles are exempt from this tax.
This tax is not considered as a deductible expense for CIT purposes.
## Municipal taxes
### Business permit tax
City governments assess an annual municipal permit tax levied on all individuals and companies that carry out economic activities within the municipal jurisdiction. The tax rate is based on the equity of the taxpayer, where the minimum payable amount is USD 10 and the maximum cannot exceed USD 25,000 per year.
### Municipal assets tax
The municipal assets tax is levied on all individuals and companies required to keep accounting records in accordance with Ecuadorian tax legislation. This tax is levied annually at a rate of 1.5 per thousand (or 0.15%) of total assets less current and contingent liabilities, as shown on the balance sheet.
### Municipal real estate tax
The city governments assess an annual municipal property tax, which ranges between 0.25 per thousand and 5 per thousand (0.025% to 0.5%) of the commercial value of the property, as determined by valuation carried out by the city government, for both urban and rural properties (rural property is taxed at a maximum of 0.3%).
