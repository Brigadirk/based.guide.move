## Social security contributions
Social security contributions must be paid to the Ecuadorian Social Security System. There are two different rates, according to the individuals' employment relationship.
Private employees under a labour relationship will contribute at the rate of 9.45% of remuneration arising from employment (except certain statutory social benefits received). Special rates apply to employees working on special sectors of the economy. Voluntary contributors must pay a rate of 17.6% over their income.
The employer contribution amounts to 12.15% of total remuneration.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)

Professionals are required to file VAT returns.
