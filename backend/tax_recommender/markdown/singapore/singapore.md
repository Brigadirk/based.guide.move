# Singapore
## Overview
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Singapore, an island country in Southeast Asia, is located off the southern edge of the Malay Peninsula, between Malaysia and Indonesia. Its official languages are English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, and the currency is the Singapore dollar (SGD).
Singapore is one of the world's most prosperous countries, with strong international trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and with a _per capita_ gross domestic product (GDP) comparable to or exceeding that of many nations in Western Europe.
Singapore has a highly developed and successful free-market economy. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in information technology products and pharmaceuticals, as well as a vibrant financial services sector.
Over the longer term, the government aims to establish a new path that focuses on innovation and value creation. Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production, and it will continue to establish itself as Southeast Asia's financial and technology hub.
