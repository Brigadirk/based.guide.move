## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Companies (resident and non-resident) that carry on a business in Singapore are taxed on their Singapore-sourced income when it arises and on foreign-sourced income when it is received in Singapore. Non-residents are subject to withholding tax (WHT) on certain types of income (e.g. interest, royalties, technical service fees, rental of movable property) where these are deemed to arise in Singapore (_for details, see the section_).
Tax on corporate income is imposed at a flat rate of 17%.
A partial tax exemption and a three-year start-up tax exemption for qualifying start-up companies are available.
Partial tax exemption (income taxable at normal rate):
Chargeable income (SGD) | Exempt from tax | Exempt income (SGD)  
---|---|---  
First 10,000 | 75% | 7,500  
Next 190,000 | 50% | 95,000  
Total | 102,500  
Start-up tax exemption (income taxable at normal rate):
Chargeable income (SGD) | Exempt from tax | Exempt income (SGD)  
---|---|---  
First 100,000 | 75% | 75,000  
Next 100,000 | 50% | 50,000  
Total | 125,000  
The start-up exemption is not available to property development and investment holding companies.
For income year 2023 (year of assessment 2024), eligible companies will receive a non-taxable CIT rebate cash grant of SGD 2,000. In addition, all companies will be granted a 50% CIT rebate, capped at SGD 40,000 if the company does not qualify for the CIT rebate cash grant or SGD 38,000 if it does.
Singapore adopts a one-tier taxation system, under which all dividends paid by Singapore-resident companies are tax-exempt in the shareholderâ€™s hands.
