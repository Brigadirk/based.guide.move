## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 30 May 2024
Certain payments to non-residents are subject to WHT.
Unless a lower treaty rate applies, interest on loans and rentals from movable property are subject to WHT at the rate of 15%. Royalty payments are subject to WHT at the rate of 10%. The tax withheld represents a final tax and applies only to non-residents that are not carrying on any business in Singapore and have no PE in Singapore. Technical assistance and management fees for services rendered in Singapore by non-resident companies are taxed at the prevailing corporate rate. However, this is not a final tax. Royalties, interest, rental of movable property, technical assistance, and management fees can be exempt from WHT in certain situations or subject to a reduction in tax rates, usually under fiscal incentives or DTAs.
Payments made to public entertainers and non-resident professionals who perform services in Singapore are also subject to a final tax of 15% on their gross income. For public entertainers, this appears to be a final tax unless they qualify to be taxed as Singapore tax residents. However, non-resident professionals may elect to be taxed at the prevailing tax rate for non-resident individuals of 24% on net income if this results in a lower tax cost. 
Ship charter fee payments are not subject to WHT.
The WHT rates are shown in the following table.
