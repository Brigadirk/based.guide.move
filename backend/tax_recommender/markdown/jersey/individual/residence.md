# Jersey, Channel Islands
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
In general terms, any of the following constitute residence status for tax purposes:
  * Spending a period, or periods, equal in the whole to six months on the island in any one tax year.
  * Maintaining a place of abode on the island, available for use, if the individual then stays there for one night.
  * Visiting the island year on year for a substantial period or periods of time. The Jersey tax authorities would normally regard average annual visits of three months as 'substantial'.


The concept of ordinarily resident is related, _inter alia_ , to the place where the person is habitually resident.
Residency rules in Jersey are currently being reviewed, with a number of existing concessions recently legislated for and broader changes anticipated in the future.
