  * Pension contributions made to approved schemes are allowable up to the lower of GBP 50,000 or relevant earnings. However, relief is restricted for individuals whose income is GBP 150,000 or more by the withdrawal of GBP 1 of relief for every GBP 1 of income above GBP 150,000.
  * Professional subscriptions.
  * Interest relief is available for loans taken out for a 'qualifying purpose'.
