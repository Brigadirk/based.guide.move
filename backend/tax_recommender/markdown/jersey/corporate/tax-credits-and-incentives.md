## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 08 January 2025
There are generally no special incentives for locally owned businesses in view of the low rate of tax.
## Foreign tax credit
There is no local foreign tax credit regime in Jersey. DTAs need to be considered as appropriate. Unilateral relief may be available under very limited specific circumstances.
