## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Income tax is payable by individuals resident in Tanzania (other than short-term residents) on their worldwide income. ‘Short-term residents’ and non-residents are taxable on income from a Tanzanian source.
Personal services have a Tanzanian source if (i) performed in Tanzania or (ii) performed outside Tanzania but where the payer is the government of Tanzania.
## Personal income tax rates
The top marginal rate of tax for resident individuals is 30% (_see tax table below_).
Non-resident individuals are subject to tax at a flat rate of 15% on employment income, which is final tax in Tanzania.
For individuals with business turnover not exceeding 100 million Tanzanian shillings (TZS) _per annum_ , specific presumptive income tax rates apply, _as set out in the table under Business income in the section_.
Where the income from investment represents a ‘final withholding payment’, the tax rate applicable is the relevant withholding tax (WHT) rate. The disposal of an investment with a Tanzanian source is subject to tax at a rate of 10% if disposed by a resident and 30% if disposed by a non-resident. The disposal by a resident of an investment with an overseas source is subject to tax at a rate of 30%.
