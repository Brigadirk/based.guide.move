## Rental income
Based on the new taxation regime (effective starting from 1 January 2023), rental gross income not exceeding DZD 1,800,000 will be subject to a discharging withholding tax (WHT) of:
  * 7% on income stemming from the rental of residential properties.
  * 15% on income stemming from the rental of unfurnished commercial or professional properties (also applicable to contracts concluded with companies).
  * 15% on income stemming from rental of bare lands. This rate will be reduced to 10% in case of agricultural lands.


Where the annual income exceeds the DZD 1,800,000 threshold, a provisional taxation of 7% will apply on the income irrespective of the nature of the property. 
Such payment could be then deducted from the final taxation of the individual annual income. In this case, the individual will be required to file to the annual PIT return on which provisional taxation will be deducted as a tax credit from the PIT due amount as determined on the basis of the total annual income.
## Exempt income
Starting from 1 January 2021, there is a PIT exemption for special living conditions of residence and isolation at up to 70% of the basic salary.
