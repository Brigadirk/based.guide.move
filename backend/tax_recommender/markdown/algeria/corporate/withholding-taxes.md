## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
_As explained in the section_ , the WHT levied on services is 30%, which covers CIT, TPA, and VAT (i.e. three taxes in one). The calculation base is the gross amount of the services invoiced. In principle, it could be reduced or removed by a DTT.
The WHT levied on dividends (15% for both residents and non-residents) and the 10% WHT levied on interest can be reduced in the presence of a DTT.
In accordance with Article 46 of FL 2022, distributed profits between Algerian resident entities that have been previously subject to CIT undergo a 5% WHT.
The WHT levied on royalties is 30%. In the presence of a DTT, the WHT cannot exceed 5%, 10%, or 12%, depending on different cases.
