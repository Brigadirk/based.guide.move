## Depreciation and amortisation
The depreciation rates are determined according to common usage and the accounting rules, for example:
  * The depreciation rate for office items is 10% or 20%.
  * The depreciation rate for industrial buildings is 5%.
  * The depreciation rate for cars is 20% or 25%. The depreciation base for cars is limited to DZD 3 million.
