## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is applied on the supply of goods or services in Algeria. It includes all economic activities conducted in Algeria. The standard VAT rate is 19%. The reduced rate is 9%, applying to various basic items listed by law.
Monthly VAT returns and payments are due by the 20th day of the following month.
## Customs duties
Algerian imports are subject to payment of customs duties in the following increments: duty-free, 5%, 15%, 30%, or 60%.
A list of banned equipment for importation has been published in January 2018.
In July 2018, another measure has been introduced by Complementary Finance Law (CFL) 2018 to discourage importing certain goods. For this purpose, an additional provisional safeguard right (_Droit Additionnel Provisiore de_ _Sauvergarde_ or DAPS) has been set up on a limited list of imported goods. DAPS rates range from 30% to 200%.
For 2022, a new list of 2,608 goods subject to DAPS has been released.
Specific customs exemptions and temporary admission regimes are granted to the oil and gas sector and to investments under the incentives tax regime of the National Agency of Investment (ANDI in French).
Bear in mind that goods originated from countries having signed free trade agreements (such as the European Union [EU] and Arab Free Exchange Zone [GZALE]) with Algeria benefit from a customs preferential regime (reduced customs duties rates or exemptions).
