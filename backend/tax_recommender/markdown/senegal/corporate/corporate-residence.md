## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Companies are considered as Senegalese residents if they have a registered fixed establishment. Nonetheless, foreign companies that are not registered locally may be deemed to have a PE in Senegal in relation to their local activity and will then be subject to tax liabilities.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The criteria for a PE were derived from the former GTC and are close to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards. The current GTC does not include a PE provision, but the former one should be applicable. DTTs can be applicable and can provide specific definitions. These DTTs are based on the OECD model in most cases. _See the section for a list of countries with which Senegal has concluded DTTs_.
