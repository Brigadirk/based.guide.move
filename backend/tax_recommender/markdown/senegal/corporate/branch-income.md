## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
In general, the tax on branch income is similar to that of corporate income. Nonetheless, a 10% duty is automatically applied to profits generated after CIT. It corresponds to an automatic application of the 10% tax on payment on dividends applicable to a company.
Headquarter expenses, which are a proration of the worldwide office expenses, may be allocated to the Senegal branch. This proration is based upon a ratio of the local turnover of the branch and the worldwide turnover of the parent company. It applies to the total amount of headquarters’ expenses incurred by the company. In addition, the deductibility of headquarters’ expenses is limited to 20% of the accounting profits before the deduction. This limitation does not apply to other types of services provided by headquarters, such as technical assistance.
