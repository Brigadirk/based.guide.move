## Foreign tax relief
The specific process to enforce the foreign tax credits either in Senegal or abroad (depending on the payments directions) is stipulated within the specific DTT with the relevant country. Nonetheless, as far Senegal is concerned, the practice consisting of enforcing foreign tax credits locally is very rare.
