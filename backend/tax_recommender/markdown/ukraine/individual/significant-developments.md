  * A tax deduction is allowed not only with respect to secondary and higher educational expenses, but also for expenses incurred in relation to pre-school, extracurricular, and school education. The total amount of the tax deduction charged to the taxpayer in the reporting tax year may not exceed the amount of the annual general taxable income of the taxpayer calculated as a salary.
  * Currency exchange differences are added to calculation of individual’s investment profit, etc.
  * Starting from 2021, private entrepreneurs have a right not to pay mandatory monthly USC if they are simultaneously employed at their main place of work based on a labour contract and their employer pays USC on their behalf in the amount not less than the minimal USC established by the law.


## 2020 tax legislation updates
In 2020, the Ukrainian government passed a law amending the tax legislation of Ukraine. Below we provide the list of main changes/clarifications in respect of taxation of individuals:
  * Investment income from foreign sources is taxed according to the rules established for taxation of investment profit/loss.
  * In case of sale or acquisition by the taxpayer of investment assets to/from non-residents that are related parties or non-residents registered in the states (territories) included in the list approved by the Cabinet of Ministers (e.g. whose CIT rate is 5% or more lower than in Ukraine, countries with which Ukraine has not concluded international agreements on the exchange of information), income and expenses on such transactions are determined: 
    * in the amount not lower than the usual price, in case of sale, and
    * in the amount not higher than the usual price, in case of purchase.
  * The entry into force of the controlled foreign company (CFC) took place 1 January 2022. Its main statements are: 
    * Tax residents who are controlling persons for a foreign company will have to determine their share of the profits of such company in accordance with the rules of the Tax Code of Ukraine, declare it in the annual declaration of property status and income, and pay tax at the following rates: 
      * 9% if the individual actually receives the allocated funds (directly or through the chain of indirect ownership) and such distribution took place before the submission of the CFC report.
      * 18% in other cases. Recalculation of the tax (from 18% to 9%) and refund of part of the paid tax is possible provided that the individual actually receives the allocated funds and submits an adjusting annual tax return before the end of the second calendar year following the reporting year.
    * Under certain conditions, the amount of PIT may be reduced by the amount of taxes paid by the CFC.
    * The CFC profit received as dividends from legal entities of Ukraine is taxed at the rates of 5% or 9% (from mutual investment institutions or business entities that are not CIT payers). In this case, such amount is not taken into account when determining the portion of the CFC profit and is not subject to further taxation during its actual payment in favour of the controlling person. Dividends previously taxed at the level of a Ukrainian company are not subject to re-taxation.

## Military tax
A temporary 1.5% military tax on personal income was introduced in August 2014. This will be effective until the reformation of the Ukrainian Military Forces is completed and affects all taxable income of residents and non-residents in Ukraine. The tax base is not capped. Ukrainian employers and other tax agents are responsible for tax withholding.
Military tax from income not received from a tax agent should be paid on a self-assessment basis within the deadlines for PIT. It cannot be relieved using a double tax treaty (DTT).
In accordance with Law 4015-IX, which came into force on 1 December 2024, the military tax rate has been increased or introduced for new categories of taxpayers and is the following:
  1. For individuals: Increased from 1.5% to 5%; the tax base is the same as the PIT base.
  2. Introduced for private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime: 10% of a monthly amount of minimum salary set as of 1 January of the reporting year (UAH 7,100 for 2024 year, UAH 8,000 for 2025 year) applies on a monthly basis.
  3. Introduced for taxpayers registered on the third group of the simplified regime: 1% from the gross taxable income (i.e. revenue).
  4. For individuals on military service and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Security Service of Ukraine, Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine, Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, National Guard of Ukraine, State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, and State Special Transport: 1.5% from the PIT base.


Starting from the 1 January of the year following the year when martial law will be cancelled, the military tax rate for individuals will be 1.5%.
Private entrepreneurs-physical persons registered on the first, second, and fourth groups of the simplified regime pay military tax not later than the 20th day (inclusive) of the current month. The controlling authority calculates the advance payments. Advance payment of military tax could be done for the whole tax (reporting) period (quarter, year) but not more than by the end of the current reporting year.
Taxpayers who are registered on the third group of the simplified regime pay military tax within ten days after the deadline for filing a tax declaration for the reporting quarter.
Payers of the military tax listed in points (ii) and (iii) above declare military tax in their tax return of a payer of single tax. The penalties that apply to the violation of military tax payment for private entrepreneurs are the same as for violations of unified tax payment for a respective group.
