## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Domestic branches or other separate units are not treated as separate taxpayers for CIT purposes.
In Ukraine, it is not currently possible to register a branch of a foreign legal entity. A foreign company may set up a representative office in Ukraine, which is similar to an unincorporated branch. A non-resident company conducting business activities via a representative office is deemed to carry out business in Ukraine through a PE and may be subject to CIT at the standard rate.
When a foreign company conducts business in Ukraine through a PE, the taxable income should be determined on the same basis as for domestic entities. The non-residents having a PE in Ukraine must register with the Ukrainian tax authorities and pay CIT to the budget.
The non-residents having a PE in Ukraine should calculate their taxable profits in the ordinary way as net profits before tax (NPBT) as per accounting records and adjusted for 'tax differences' (_see the section_). Taxable income of the PE should be determined based on the arm’s-length principle.
Distributions made by a PE (from after-tax income) to its head office should not trigger any further taxation in Ukraine, provided that the head office is in a jurisdiction that has an effective DTT with Ukraine. However, certain DTTs with Ukraine provide for the so-called ‘branch tax’ on such distributions, similar to WHT on dividend income.
PEs of non-residents are subject to transfer pricing rules.
