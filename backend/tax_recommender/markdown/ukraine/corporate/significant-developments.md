## Advance CIT payments to be paid by fuel trade retailers
Starting from December 2024, fuel trade retailers are obliged to pay advance CIT payments for each place of retail fuel trade included in the Unified Register of Licensees and Places of Circulation. Advance CIT payments are to be made on a monthly basis not later than the 20th day of the reporting month.
