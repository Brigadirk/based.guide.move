## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
The government issued regulations regarding a new individual withholding tax (WHT) rate on employment, service, and activity income received by individuals, which is effective starting 1 January 2024 and aims to simplify the monthly WHT calculation in relation to the above types of income. 
The monthly calculation for months of January to November is to be performed using the new effective tax rate (ETR) while the annual calculation method remains the same. The ETR is differentiated based on certain conditions, such as type of income recipient, marital status, etc. 
Specifically for employees, the ETR is applied on the gross income received by the individual in a particular month without applying any annualisation or deduction on the gross income.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
A tax resident is generally taxed on worldwide income, although this may be mitigated by the application of double taxation agreements (DTAs). However, the Omnibus Law has added a provision to the Income Tax Law stipulating that foreigners who have become domestic tax subjects by reason of becoming tax resident in Indonesia can be taxed only on Indonesian-sourced income (including if paid offshore) if they meet certain skill requirements. This will only be available for the first four years they become tax resident. This territorial taxation system may not be applicable when the foreigner receives income from overseas and utilises the applicable tax treaty between Indonesia and the source country. Indonesian citizens that are living outside of Indonesia for more than 183 days in 12 months and meet certain requirements can also be considered as foreign tax subjects.
Non-resident individuals are subject to a general WHT at 20% in respect of their Indonesian-sourced income. Concessions are, however, available where a DTA is in force.
The rates applied to taxable income are shown below.
## Individual tax rates
Taxable income (IDR*) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Up to IDR 60 million | 5  
Above IDR 60 million to IDR 250 million | 15  
Above IDR 250 million to IDR 500 million | 25  
Above IDR 500 million to IDR 5 billion | 30  
Above IDR 5 billion | 35  
* Indonesian rupiah
## Tax on severance payments
Severance payments are taxed separately at the following rates*:
Taxable income (IDR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Up to IDR 50 million | 0  
Above IDR 50 million to IDR 100 million | 5  
Above IDR 100 million to IDR 500 million | 15  
Above IDR 500 million | 25  
* The rates are final and applied only if the payment is made at once, or in two years at the maximum if the payment is made in sequence. For payments for year three onwards, the ordinary individual tax rates apply.
## Tax on lump-sum pension payments
The final tax rates for lump-sum pension payments from a government-approved pension fund and old-age security saving payments from _Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial Ketenagakerjaan (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan)_ (_see Social security contributions in the section_) are as follows*:
Taxable income (IDR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Up to IDR 50 million | 0  
Above IDR 50 million | 5  
* The rates are final and applied only if the payment is made at once, or in two years at the maximum if the payment is made in sequence. For payments for year three onwards, the ordinary individual tax rates apply.
## Local income taxes

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year is the same as the calendar year, or 1 January through 31 December.
## Payments of tax and tax returns filing
Tax liabilities for a particular period or year must typically be paid to the State Treasury through a designated tax-payment bank (_bank persepsi_) and then accounted for to the DGT office through the filing of an annual tax return.
A substantial part of individual income tax is collected through withholding by third parties. Employers are required to withhold Article 21/26 Income Tax on a monthly basis from the salaries and other compensation payable to their employees. Typically, the amount of tax withheld from this income (Article 21 Income Tax) is based on normal tax rates (_see the section_). Fees for non-employee individuals and certain professionals, such as lawyers, notaries, accountants, architects, doctors, actuaries, and appraisers, are subject to a tax calculation norm, hence the tax withheld is based on 50% of the gross income at the prevailing rates.
A summary of individual tax obligations is as follows:
Type of tax return | Tax payment deadline | Tax return filing deadline  
---|---|---  
Monthly Individual Income Tax (Article 25 Income Tax) | The 15th day of the following month. | The 20th day of the following month.  
Annual Individual Income Tax | The end of the third month after the calendar year end before filing the tax return. | The end of the third month after the calendar year end.  
### Penalties
Late payment of tax incurs interest penalties with a rate resulting from the application of the MoF Interest Rate (MIR) plus a surcharge. Part of a month (e.g. a single day) is considered a full month. Late filing of annual tax return incurs an administrative penalty of IDR 100,000.
### E-filing
An individual taxpayer can submit an annual tax return through the e-filing system provided by the Indonesian Tax Office (ITO).
## Tax assessment and audit process
Indonesia uses a self-assessment system under which taxpayers are trusted to calculate, pay, and report their own taxes in accordance with prevailing tax laws and regulations. However, the DGT may issue tax assessment letters to a particular taxpayer if it finds that, based on a tax audit or on other information, the taxpayer has not fully paid all tax liabilities. A tax assessment letter may also be issued by the DGT to a taxpayer who ignores a warning letter to file a tax return within a specified period. Most tax refund requests will trigger a tax audit, except for taxpayers eligible for early tax refunds. Due to the requirement for the DGT to decide on a refund request within 12 months, a tax audit will typically begin within a few weeks to several months from the refund request date.
## Statute of limitations
Under the current Tax Administration Law, the DGT can issue an underpaid tax assessment letter within five years after the incurrence of a tax liability, the end of a tax period (month), or the end of (part of) a tax year.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Employment income
Employment income includes salaries, overtime, bonuses, and any type of allowance (e.g. housing, leave allowance).
Benefits in kind are generally taxable in the hands of the employee. An exception applies to benefits in kind that are required for the execution of a job, the cost of providing benefits in kind in certain areas, food and drink provided to all employees, benefits in kind financed from the government’s budget, and certain types of benefits in kind with a certain threshold.
## Equity compensation
The value of shares given to a director or employee or obtained under a share option scheme as a reward for services may be taxable as regular individual income.
## Business income
Taxable business profits are calculated on the basis of normal accounting principles as modified by certain tax adjustments. Generally, a deduction is allowed for all expenditure incurred to obtain, collect, and maintain taxable business profits. A timing difference may arise if an expenditure recorded as an expense for accounting cannot be immediately claimed as a deduction for tax.
Individual taxpayers conducting business activities or independent work whose gross annual turnover is less than IDR 4.8 billion may calculate their net income using a deemed profit based on a calculation norm of net income provided that they notify the Director General Tax (DGT) within three months of the fiscal year concerned. The calculation norm is determined by the DGT based on type and location of the business.
Certain individuals with business turnover of not more than IDR 4.8 billion are subject to final tax at 0.5% of turnover. Under the HPP Law, individual taxpayers within a certain gross turnover threshold that is subject to final tax are not subject to income tax for gross turnover of up to IDR 500 million in one fiscal year.
Under the Omnibus Law, income received by an Indonesian taxpayer from a permanent establishment (PE) abroad and other active business income from abroad (not from a PE or foreign subsidiary) is not taxable in Indonesia if being invested in Indonesia within a certain period.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are generally assessable at ordinary tax rates together with other income of the individual. The exceptions are sale of land and buildings and exchange-traded shares (i.e. listed on the Indonesian stock exchange), given that these are subject to final tax at the point of sale (_see Property taxes and Sale of shares taxes in the section_).
## Dividend income
Dividends received from an Indonesian limited liability company are subject to final income tax at a rate of 10%. However, it becomes non-taxable if the recipient is a domestic individual taxpayer whose dividends are reinvested in Indonesia within a certain period.
## Interest income
Interest income on time deposits and savings with Indonesian banks or their overseas branches, as well as interest income on time deposits placed through Indonesian branches of foreign banks (in any currency), are currently subject to final income tax at rate of 20%. Interest on bonds is subject to final income tax at 10%, the tax collected through withholding by the payer.
## Other investment income
Other types of investment income are generally assessable at ordinary tax rates.
## Rental income
Income from rentals of land and/or building is subject to 10% final tax. Income from rentals of assets other than land and buildings is subject to 2% WHT, which is considered as prepaid for the tax assessed on the total income of the individual.
## Exempt income
Certain items are exempt from individual income tax, including property acquired by gift, gains from mutual funds, and profit distribution received by a member of partnership (the net income is already taxed at the entity level).

## Social security contributions
Indonesia does not have a comprehensive social security system; however, there is a worker’s social security program (_BPJS Ketenagakerjaan_) that provides work accidents protection, death insurance, old age savings, healthcare, and pension. The program is maintained by a designated state-owned company,  _BPJS Ketenagakerjaan,_ which has conducted the social security schemes in Indonesia and calls for premium contributions for the following:
Areas covered | As a percentage of regular salaries/wages  
---|---  
Borne by employer (%) | Borne by employee (%)  
Working accident protection (1) | 0.24 to 1.74 | -  
Death insurance (1) | 0.3 | -  
Unemployment insurance (_Jaminan Kehilangan Pekerjaan_) – for workers affected by lay-off | Reallocated from working accident protection and death insurance | -  
Old age saving (1) | 3.7 | 2  
Healthcare (2) | 4 |  1  
Pension (3) | 2 | 1  
Notes
  1. Calculation base is basic salary plus fixed allowance.
  2. Maximum calculation base is IDR 12 million/month starting 1 January 2020. 
  3. Maximum calculation base is updated annually based on BPJS regulation.


Employers are responsible for ascertaining that their employees are covered by workers' social security programs under two government social security agencies as follows:
  * Social Security Agency for Health Insurance (_BPJS Kesehatan_), covering health insurance.
  * Social Security Agency for Workers' Social Security (_BPJS Ketenagakerjaan_), covering working accidents, deaths and old age, and pensions.


Employees’ contributions are collected by the employer through payroll deductions. These must be paid to BPJS together with the contributions borne by the employers.
## Public housing savings
_Please see the section in the Corporate tax summary for a description of the public housing savings_.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
With a few exceptions, VAT is applicable on deliveries (sales) of goods and services within Indonesia at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. VAT on export of goods is zero-rated whilst the import of goods is subject to VAT at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. Zero-rated VAT is also applicable on certain exported services, but subject to a Minister of Finance (MoF) limitation.  _Please see the section in the Corporate tax summary for the VAT on export services by type_.
Services performed within the Customs Area for customers outside of the Customs Area are considered as locally delivered and are therefore subject to the regular VAT rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards. Inbound use or consumption of foreign services or intangible goods, with a few exceptions, is also subject to a self-assessed VAT at a rate of 12% starting 1 January 2025 onwards.
The VAT law allows the government to change the VAT rate within the range of 5% to 15%. 
In general, VAT collection is based on the accrual principle, whereby VAT must be collected at the time of delivery of taxable goods or services. The term delivery, in this case, is defined as the time when risk and ownership of goods have been transferred or when income from a service delivery can be reliably estimated or measured. In the accrual system, income or receivables are acknowledged when a transaction takes place, regardless of whether the transaction has been paid for or not. The recognition of revenue or receivables is indicated by the issue of a commercial invoice, which is a source document for this recognition and a basis for recording it.
Starting 1 April 2022, the HPP Law changes the status of several non-VATable objects under the existing law. Some remain as non-VATable objects but with certain requirements, and some become VATable objects but with an exemption and/or non-collection of VAT facility.
Individuals may be designated as taxable entrepreneurs (_Pengusaha Kena Pajak_ or PKP) if they have their own business activities that deliver VAT-able goods/services with an annual value of a minimum of IDR 4.8 billion. PKPs are required to report their business activities and settle the VAT liabilities on these every month, with payment and filing being due no later than the last day of the month following the taxable delivery.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Indonesia.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There are no inheritance, estate, and gift taxes in Indonesia. Income from lottery prizes is subject to a 25% final income tax.
## Property taxes
Land and buildings tax (_Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan_ or PBB) is due annually at maximum 0.5% of the regional government-determined market value.
A transfer of land and building will cause income tax on the deemed gain on the transfer/sale to be charged to the transferor/seller. The tax is set at 2.5% of the greater of the gross transfer value or the regional government-determined market value.
In a land and building transfer, the acquirer is liable for duty on the acquisition of land and building rights (_Bea Pengalihan Hak atas Tanah dan Bangunan_ or BPHTB) at 5% of the greater of the transaction value or the regional government-determined market value.
## Sale of shares taxes
Generally, capital gains from sale of shares are subject to normal income tax. Sale of shares on Indonesian stock exchanges is subject to a 0.1% final income tax rate on the proceeds. Founder shareholders may choose to pay tax at 0.5% of the market price of their shares upon listing. If they do not choose this, gains on subsequent sales are taxed under ordinary rules (under certain tax treaties, this tax may not be due).
## Luxury-goods sales tax (LST)
In addition to VAT, some goods are subject to LST upon import or delivery by the manufacturer to another party at rates currently ranging from 10% to 95%.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is nominal and payable as a fixed amount of IDR 10,000 on certain documents.
## Carbon taxes
