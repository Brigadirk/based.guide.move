## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Indonesian income tax is collected mainly through a system of WHTs. Where a particular income item is subject to WHT, the payer is generally held responsible for withholding or collecting the tax. These WHTs are commonly referred to using the relevant article of the Income Tax (_Pajak Penghasilan_ or PPh) Law, as follows.
## Article 23/26 Income Tax (PPh 23/26)
Domestic Article 23 WHT is payable at the rate of 2% for most types of services where the recipient of the payment is an Indonesian resident and 15% for a variety of payments to resident corporations and individuals.
For non-residents, Art. 26 WHT of 20% is applicable. The WHT rate for bond interest income, including the capital gain (i.e. premium and discount) enjoyed upon disposal, that is received or obtained by non-residents other than PEs can be given a lower WHT rate of 10%. Under the operation of a tax treaty, lower rates may be applicable at the following rates:
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties | Branch profits (8)  
Portfolio | Substantial holdings  
Resident corporations | 15 | 0 | 15 | 15 | N/A  
Resident individuals | 10 | 10 | 15 | 15 | N/A

  2. VAT is reciprocally exempted from the income earned on the operation of ships or aircraft in international lanes.
  3. The treaty is silent concerning BPT rate. The ITO interprets this to mean that the tax rate under Indonesian Tax Law (20%) should apply.
  4. Labuan offshore companies (under the Labuan Offshore Business Activity Tax Act 1990) are not entitled to the tax treaty benefits. Amended protocol was signed on 20 October 2011 and ratified on 4 August 2017 but is pending the exchange of ratification documents.
  5. Ratified but not yet effective, pending the exchange of ratification documents.
  6. Interest: 
    1. Exempt if paid to the government.
    2. Exempt if paid to a bank but linked to a government loan agreement or paid to specific financial institutions/banks.
  7. Royalties: 
    1. The use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right.
    2. The use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment.
    3. The supply of scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge or information.
    4. The use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematography films and films or tapes for television or radio broadcasting.
  8. PEs that reinvest their after-tax profits in Indonesia within the same year or no later than the following year are exempt from BPT on these profits (_see the_ _section_).


The issue of beneficial ownership has come under tax office scrutiny. For treaty WHT rates to apply to passive income such as interests, dividends, and royalties, the recipient of such income must be the beneficial owner. The recipient must also provide a Certificate of Domicile (CoD) in the form required by the ITO and certified by their home country tax authority that the recipient is a tax resident of that country. The CoD in the form prepared by the other countryâ€™s tax authority may only be used in limited circumstances. Further, the CoD form also requires a number of declarations to be made by the recipient that acknowledges that the use of the treaty jurisdiction was not merely for obtaining the benefit of the treaty. These declarations place onerous obligations on both the Indonesian payer and the recipient entity. Without a certified CoD, a WHT at a rate of 20% will apply. These aspects need to be considered when paying income of this nature.
