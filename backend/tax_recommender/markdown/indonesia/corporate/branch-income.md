## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Branch profits are subject to the ordinary CIT rate of 22%.
The after-tax profits are subject to a withholding tax (WHT) (i.e. branch profits tax or BPT) at 20%, regardless of whether the profits are remitted to the home country. However, a concessional WHT rate may be applicable where a tax treaty is in force (_see the section_ _for more information_). The BPT may be exempt if the profits are entirely reinvested in Indonesia (_see the_ _section for more information_).
