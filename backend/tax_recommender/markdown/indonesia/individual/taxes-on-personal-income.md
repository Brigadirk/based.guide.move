## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
A tax resident is generally taxed on worldwide income, although this may be mitigated by the application of double taxation agreements (DTAs). However, the Omnibus Law has added a provision to the Income Tax Law stipulating that foreigners who have become domestic tax subjects by reason of becoming tax resident in Indonesia can be taxed only on Indonesian-sourced income (including if paid offshore) if they meet certain skill requirements. This will only be available for the first four years they become tax resident. This territorial taxation system may not be applicable when the foreigner receives income from overseas and utilises the applicable tax treaty between Indonesia and the source country. Indonesian citizens that are living outside of Indonesia for more than 183 days in 12 months and meet certain requirements can also be considered as foreign tax subjects.
Non-resident individuals are subject to a general WHT at 20% in respect of their Indonesian-sourced income. Concessions are, however, available where a DTA is in force.
The rates applied to taxable income are shown below.
