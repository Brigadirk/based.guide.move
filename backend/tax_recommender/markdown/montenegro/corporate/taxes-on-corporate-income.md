  * On the profit above EUR 100,000.01 to EUR 1,500,000, the tax shall be paid in the amount of EUR 9,000 plus 12% on the profit above EUR 100,000.01.
  * On the profit above EUR 1,500,000.01, the tax shall be paid in the amount of EUR 177,000 plus 15% on the profit above EUR 1,500,000.01.

Non-residents are also subject to withholding tax (WHT) on income sourced in Montenegro (_see the section for more information_).
