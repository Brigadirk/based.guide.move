## Taxable period
The tax year in Montenegro is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Generally, taxpayers are obligated to submit an annual tax return at the end of April for income generated in the previous calendar year, except taxpayers that have only employment income or have only investment income.
## Payment of tax
Tax on employment income, income from capital, income from self-employment that is not the primary activity of the self-employer, and property-related income is withheld at source by the payer of income.
A self-employed taxpayer is entitled to lump-sum taxation unless oneâ€™s total turnover for the year preceding the year for which the tax is assessed exceeds EUR 18,000. This option is excluded for certain professions (e.g. lawyers, auditors).
