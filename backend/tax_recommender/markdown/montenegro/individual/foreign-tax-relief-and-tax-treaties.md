## Foreign tax relief
Resident taxpayers are entitled to a tax relief up to the amount of tax paid in another country on income realised in that country. This tax relief is equal to the tax paid in another country but may not exceed the amount of the tax that would have been paid in Montenegro.
In case the income is received from a country with which Montenegro has a DTT in place, the method for avoidance of the double taxation prescribe by the DTT (credit or exemption) will be applicable.
## Tax treaties
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Montenegro has a tax treaty._
