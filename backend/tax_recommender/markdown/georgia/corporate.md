There have been no significant corporate tax developments in Georgia during the past year.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
The tax departments under the MoF are responsible for tax administrative matters in Georgia.
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year in Georgia.
## Tax returns
The new CIT regime shifts from annual reporting to a monthly reporting practice.
CIT returns should be submitted on monthly basis before the 15th day following the month when the taxable transaction took place. As a result, the quarterly advance payment rule is abolished for companies subject to the new CIT system.
A CIT return should be submitted before 1 April of the year following the reporting period for companies under the old CIT system.
## Payment of tax
CIT is due on a monthly basis before the 15th day following the month when the taxable transaction took place for companies working under the new CIT regime.
In case a transaction was taxed with CIT and then the amount (part of the amount) remitted on this transaction was returned back to the taxpayer, the latter may set off and recover a sum of the previously paid CIT in proportion of the returned amount. This, _inter alia_ , relates to:
  * If the participation in a foreign entity was disposed of or contribution into the capital of foreign entity was returned. 
  * When a loan granted was repaid. 


Under the old CIT system, CIT is paid in advance in four equal instalments, before 15 May, 15 July, 15 September, and 15 December. The advance instalments are estimated according to the previous year’s annual tax. A taxpayer with no prior-year CIT obligation is not required to make advance payments.
Final payment is due by 1 April of the year following the reporting period. Excess CIT payments may be offset against other tax liabilities.
## Tax audit process
There are two types of tax audits: desk tax audit and field audit. The tax audit may be conducted based on the order of the Revenue Service of Georgia. The Revenue Service sends a notice to the taxpayer no less than ten working days before the commencement of the audit. The audit should commence no later than 30 days after receiving such notice by the taxpayer. Normally, the tax audit may last for three months, and may be extended to another two months with the approval of the head of the Revenue Service. The findings should be presented to the taxpayer in the form of a tax act.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations is three years in Georgia from 2017. For those taxpayers who decide to increase the loss carryforward to ten years, the statute of limitations is 11 years. The statute of limitations period was six years prior to 2015, five years in 2015, and four years in 2016.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
In recent periods, the tax authorities have become largely focused on transfer pricing issues during tax audits.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
A resident enterprise is any legal entity that is established under the laws of Georgia or has its place of effective management in Georgia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The domestic definition for a PE essentially adopts the definition for PE found in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention.
Local legislation provides the definition for economic activity to be any activity undertaken with the intent to gain profit, income, or compensation, regardless of the results of such activity, unless otherwise provided by the tax code.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
The concept of deduction is no longer applicable for the companies and PEs operating under the new CIT system, since they follow IFRS.
Under the old CIT system, expenses connected with the receipt of income generally are deductible from income, provided sufficient primary documentation is available.
## Depreciation
The declining-balance method of depreciation applies to fixed assets for tax purposes. The maximum rate of depreciation is 20% for most fixed assets, though buildings and construction are subject to depreciation at the rate of 5% (please contact us for additional information regarding other groups and rates).
A taxpayer is entitled to fully deduct costs of fixed assets (excluding those contributed to capital) in the year when the fixed assets are put into operation (a form of capital allowance). In case the taxpayer employs the right of full deduction in this manner, this method may not be changed for five years.
## Amortisation of intangible assets
Intangible assets (e.g. goodwill) are amortisable in proportion with the period of beneficial use. However, intangible assets of value less than GEL 1,000 are fully deductible from gross income.
If the period of beneficial use of an intangible asset cannot be defined, it is amortisable at the rate of 15%.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred before registration of an entity as a taxpayer (e.g. public registry fee) are not deductible under Georgian tax legislation.
## Interest expenses
Interest paid on loans is deductible within the limits established by the Finance Minister, unless it is paid on loans received from domestic licensed banks and microfinance organisations. The annual deductible interest rate limitation established by the Minister of Finance of Georgia for the year 2020 is 24%. No limits are established on loans received from domestic licensed banks and microfinance organisations.
## Bad debt
A taxpayer is entitled to deduct bad debt only if all of the following conditions are met:
  * The bad debt is related to the taxpayer’s goods or services sold.
  * Income receivable from the sale of goods or services was previously included in taxable gross income.
  * The bad debt has been written off and recorded as such in the taxpayer’s accounting records.
  * Certain documents prescribed under the Georgian tax code are available confirming that the debt is irrecoverable.


## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are deductible, up to 10% of taxable profit.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties paid to the state budget are not deductible.
## Taxes
CIT is disallowed for deduction.
## Other significant items
The following other expenses are not deductible:
  * Expenses not related to the generation of income.
  * Expenses related to the receipt of income exempted from CIT, except for the costs incurred for generating profit from the sale of debt securities of the state, of the National Bank of Georgia, the Legal Entity under Public Law – the Deposit Insurance Agency, or of an international financial institution and expenses incurred for deriving profit in the form of interests received from those securities, as well as costs for earning profit from the interest accrued to the funds placed on the accounts with the National Bank of Georgia.


The deduction of certain expenses is subject to limitations, including:
  * Representation expenses, up to 1% of gross income.
  * Repair expenses, up to 5% of the book value of the relevant asset at the end of the year. Any excess must be capitalised and deducted through depreciation.


## Net operating losses
Losses may be carried forward for five years but may not be carried back.
A taxpayer may elect to extend the carryforward period to 10 years. However, this also results in the statute of limitations period being extended from 6 to 11 years.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There is no special tax regime in Georgia for payments made to foreign affiliates; as such, general rules will apply. Payments may be classified as equity, financing, or service fee. Any such transaction will need to be at arm’s length in accordance with the Georgian transfer pricing rules.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Georgian law does not provide for taxation of groups.
## Transfer pricing
The transfer pricing rules introduced in the tax code are broadly based on the OECD arm’s-length principle adopted in tax treaties and by most countries when they implement domestic transfer pricing rules.
The law recognises the five OECD transfer pricing methods for evaluating whether prices are at arm’s length:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price method.
  * Resale price method.
  * Cost plus method.
  * Transactional net margin method.
  * Profit split method.


The tax code stipulates that in accordance with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) instructions, the tax authority may recalculate the taxes if they can prove that the prices applied by related parties to transactions differ from the market prices.
According to the instructions issued by the MoF, the methods for assessing the transfer pricing assessment rules have been explained, and the following procedures have been established:
  * Determination of comparability of independent transactions.
  * Transaction adjustment procedure.
  * Information to be represented by the parties of the transaction to the tax authority.
  * Documentation list.
  * Sources of information on market prices.
  * Price range application procedure.


The taxpayer becomes liable to present documentation to the tax authority in support of one’s position in considering income received to be consistent with market principles within 30 days of the formal request of the Revenue Service. The report can be written in both Georgian and English but should be translated to Georgian in case it is requested by the Revenue Service. The companies also have an option to sign an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) in which the transfer pricing methodology will be agreed for specific transactions with the tax authority, who will no longer have the right to charge fines/taxes on these transactions.
Under the new CIT system, transfer pricing adjustment is subject to immediate taxation.
The following general penalties, determined by tax legislation, apply for non-compliance with the arm’s-length principle or failing to prepare or submit transfer pricing documentation:
  * An understated tax liability (e.g. VAT, CIT) is subject to a penalty of 10%, 25%, or 50% of the understated tax if it is not more than 5% of the total tax amount in the same tax return, is more than 5% and less than 20%, or is more than 20% of the total tax amount in the same tax return, respectively.
  * Late payment of taxes is subject to interest at a rate of 0.05% per overdue day.
  * Failing to submit a required document is generally subject to a penalty of GEL 400.


## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
From July 2020, a new rule was introduced for multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are residents of Georgia. Namely, parent entities are required to submit a CbC report to the tax authorities by 31 December following the reporting year.
This requirement applies to MNE groups with total consolidated group revenue of the previous fiscal year higher than EUR 750 million.
Apart from this, the ultimate parent company or surrogate parent entity, which is part of the MNE group and simultaneously the resident of Georgia, is required to notify the tax authorities regarding its obligation of CbC reporting by the end of the reporting year.
## Thin capitalisation
No thin capitalisation rules are applicable in Georgia.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Georgia tax legislation does not provide CFC rules.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024

Distributed profit of a PE of a non-resident enterprise shall be a deemed distribution of profits attributable to the PE for its activities. A PE shall be allotted a profit it might have gained as an independent enterprise conducting the same or similar activity and being in the same or similar conditions.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Income tax or profit tax paid on income earned from outside Georgia may be credited against CIT payable in Georgia. The amount of credited taxes may not exceed the Georgian tax payable on the foreign income. The rule is also applicable under the new CIT system on CIT due from dividend distribution.

  * Profit earned (distribution of profit) from supplying the information technologies created by virtual zone persons outside Georgia is exempt from profit tax.
  * Supply of information technologies created by virtual zone persons outside Georgia is exempt from VAT. 


## Special Trading Company
A Special Trading Company is a company having status granted by the tax authorities. A Special Trading Company may sell and re-export foreign goods, and distribution of the profit gained as a result of conducting these activities is exempt from profit tax.
## International company
An international company is a Georgian enterprise that provides certain types of services abroad and earns income solely from those activities, unless ancillary income is immaterial (less than 2% of the income from principal activities). Status of an International company can be granted only to persons operating under the new CIT model.

  * An international company is exempt from property tax (except for land) if that property is intended for use or is used for the activities allowed by the ordinance of the government of Georgia.
  * If the status of a virtual zone person is granted to the entity, then status of an international company is cancelled.

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## International agreements
Georgia is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) Partnership for Peace Program and is actively working to join NATO and the European Union (EU). Georgia is also a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the Union of Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldova (GUUAM), and an observer in the Council of Europe.
Georgia was formerly a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Because of the August 2008 conflict with Russia, Georgia formally notified the CIS on 18 August 2008 of its intention to withdraw from the organisation, and that withdrawal came into effect on 18 August 2009. However, Georgia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said it will uphold all trade and treaty agreements made between Georgia and fellow CIS countries.
Georgia has a free-trade regime with members of the CIS, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Turkey. This results in duty-free trade of goods and services.
On 18 December 2002, the GUUAM free-trade agreement was ratified by the Georgian Parliament, the goal of which is to create favourable trade conditions and to strengthen economic links among the member countries. The agreement to form a free-trade zone was reached at the GUUAM Presidents’ Summit in July 2003 in Yalta. Uzbekistan has since left the free-trade zone.
In June 2014, the European Union and Georgia signed an unprecedented Association Agreement. This Agreement aims to deepen political and economic relations between Georgia and the European Union and to gradually integrate Georgia into the European Union.
In July 2015, an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) was signed by and between Georgia and the United States about tax reporting and withholding procedures associated with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). As a result, Georgia joined a list of countries that provide financial information to its partner country, the United States, for the deterrence of facts of tax evasion by its citizens.
In September 2022, Georgia joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on the automatic exchange of financial account information under the common reporting standards (CRS). Relevant legislative changes entered into effect from 1 January 2023.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Under the new CIT system, the income is recognised as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Under the old CIT system, taxable income is determined as the difference between the gross income of a taxpayer and the relevant deductions granted under the Georgian tax code.
## Inventory valuation
A taxpayer is required to record the value of goods produced or acquired as the outlays (except for depreciation charges) or the purchase price in tax accounting. Furthermore, the taxpayer shall include the storage and transportation expenses in the value of such goods.
A taxpayer is entitled to record the cost of inventory using the individual accounting method, the average weighted cost method, or first in first out (FIFO).
## Capital gains
The Georgian tax code does not define any separate tax for capital gains. Capital gains are taxable as normal business income at the general CIT rate.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by local legal entities (except for sole enterprises and entrepreneur partnerships) are not subject to taxation at source and shall not be included in gross income.
Dividends received by non-resident enterprises from resident enterprises are subject to WHT at source (_see the section for more information_).
## Interest income
Resident legal entities and PEs of non-residents that received interest income that was taxed at source in Georgia are entitled to a credit on tax paid to the state budget.
Interest income received from a licensed financial institution is not subject to WHT at source, and it should not be included in the gross income of a recipient unless the recipient is another licensed financial institution.
## Rent/royalty income
Rent and royalty income received by resident companies and/or PEs of non-resident enterprises should be subject to CIT upon its distribution in the form of dividends if the taxpayer is under the new CIT system. Under the old CIT system, such income should be included in the taxable gross income of the enterprises.
A non-resident enterprise deriving income from renting property to a person having no liability to act as a tax agent and withhold taxes is subject to CIT on the difference between the Georgian source income earned during a calendar year and deductions related to the receipt of such income.
## Foreign income
Resident legal entities are subject to CIT on their worldwide income. Under the new CIT system, foreign income is subject to CIT at 15% upon its distribution in the form of dividends. Taxes withheld abroad can be offset against CIT charged on distribution of foreign income.


# Georgia
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
Resident enterprises are subject to corporate income tax (CIT) on worldwide income.
Non-resident enterprises carrying out economic activities in Georgia through a permanent establishment (PE) are subject to CIT with respect to its Georgian-source income.
The CIT rate is a flat 15%.
A 20% CIT rate applies to commercial banks, credit unions, microfinance organisations, and loan providers from 1 January 2023.
Non-resident enterprises earning income from Georgian sources, other than through a PE, are subject to withholding taxes (WHTs) (_see the section for more information_).
## New CIT system
From 1 January 2017, Georgia has switched to a new CIT system. The new system represents the adoption of the Estonian model of CIT to the Georgian tax system. As such, retained profits are no longer taxable until they are distributed. The new regime is not aimed to exempt the profits from taxation but is designed to defer the taxation moment. Consequently, taxpayers no longer need to determine taxable gross income and allowable deductions in order to arrive at the taxable profits, but rather a standard CIT rate of 15% is applicable to the grossed-up value of the following transactions:
  * Profit distribution.
  * Costs incurred not related to economic activity.
  * Free of charge distributions.
  * Over limit representative expenses.


### Distributed profit
Distributed profit encompasses distribution of profits by an enterprise to its partner as a dividend in a monetary or non-monetary form.
Distribution of dividends between Georgian legal entities and distribution of dividends received from a foreign enterprise (except for a person registered in a country with preferential tax treatment) are not subject to CIT.
Distributed profit of a PE of a non-resident enterprise shall be a deemed distribution of profits attributable to the PE for its activities. A PE shall be allotted a profit it might have gained as an independent enterprise conducting the same or similar activity and being in the same or similar conditions.
### Costs incurred not related to economic activity
Costs not related to economic activity shall be:
  * Non-documented expenses.
  * Expenses, the purpose of which is not to gain profit, income, or compensation.
  * The interest paid for a credit (loan) above the annual interest rate established by the Minister of Finance of Georgia (i.e. 24%).


Certain transactions are deemed as non-business expenses, which, _inter alia_ , include:
  * Payments for acquisition of shares/interest of a non-resident enterprise or contributions made in the capital of a non-resident enterprise.
  * Granting of a loan to a natural person or a non-resident.


Certain transaction with persons registered in the countries with preferential tax regimes are also subject to immediate taxation of CIT. Among them are:
  * Provision of loans to such persons.
  * Purchase of debt securities issued by such persons.
  * Payment of contractual penalties and fines to such persons.
  * Payment of advances to such persons.
  * Acquisition of debt claim towards such persons.
  * Loss derived as a result of transferring the right of claim to such entities.
  * Loss incurred from waiving the claim receivable from such entities.


The main purpose of the listed taxable objects is to mitigate hidden distribution of profit without taxation. That said, the tax law requires taxation of such cash outflow, which may be embodied with profit distribution, though in turn it allows one to claim back the paid CIT when the cash is returned. Specifically, the Georgian tax code sets that companies have the right to credit the CIT paid previously in the following cases:
  * When compensation is received as a result of supply of debt securities.
  * When compensation is received from supply of shares or transfer of right of claim.
  * When issued loan/paid advances is fully or partially returned (in proportion of returned amount).
  * When goods/services are received in exchange for the paid advances.
  * When security of issued loan from the third party is cancelled.


### Free of charge delivery of goods/services and/or transfer of funds
Free of charge delivery of goods/services and transfer of funds will be subject to CIT. Additionally, shortage of inventory and/or fixed assets will be considered as free of charge supply at the moment of its revealing and will be taxed accordingly by CIT.
### Representative expenses
Representative expenses exceeding the specific limit will be subject to CIT. The limit determined for these purposes is 1% of the company’s total revenues derived or expenses incurred in the previous calendar year, whichever is greater.
## Local income taxes
There are no regional or local income taxes imposed on the profit of legal entities.

Last reviewed - 30 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 18% and applies to the supply of all goods and services for consideration on the territory of Georgia within the scope of economic activities.
Goods are considered to be supplied in Georgia if they are located on the Georgian territory upon its transfer. If the supply of goods is accompanied by transportation, then the place of supply is considered in Georgia if its shipment originates in Georgia.
Under the general rule, place of supply of services depends on whether it is business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) supply, as follows:
  * In case of B2B supplies, the place where the service recipient or its fixed establishment is located is considered as the place of service delivery.
  * In case of B2C supplies, the place where the supplier or its fixed establishment is located is deemed the place of service delivery.


However, in relation to certain types of services, place of B2C supplies is determined based on the location of the recipient. Such services, among others, include telecommunication services, electronically supplied services, advertising, consulting, financial services, insurance services, etc.
Additionally, special place of supply rules apply for services related to immovable and movable property, transportation services, catering, leisure activities, etc.
A person established in Georgia must register as a VAT payer when its taxable turnover exceeds 100,000 Georgian lari (GEL) in any continuous 12-month period. Georgian fixed establishment of a foreign taxable person is liable for VAT registration from the beginning of taxable operations.
