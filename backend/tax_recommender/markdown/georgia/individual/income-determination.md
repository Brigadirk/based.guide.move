## Employment income
The following payments or benefits received from an employer would be treated as taxable income (not exhaustive):
  * Per-diems and accommodation expenses received in excess of norms established by Georgian Ministry of Finance.
  * Private use of the company's automobile where an employee is legally entitled (according to the employment agreement, charter, etc.) for such use (except for those having an electric engine).
  * When receiving loans at an interest rate lower than the rate established by the Finance Minister, the difference between the established and actual interest rates.
  * Goods or services sold or transferred free of charge by employer to employee.
  * Accommodation.
  * Assistance for education of an employee or their dependants (excluding training programs directly related to performance of the employee's duties).
  * Life and health insurance premiums.


## Capital gains
The profit received from sale of a vehicle and an apartment (house) with attached land plot is subject to tax at a 5% rate.
## Rental income
Personal income tax (PIT) at 5% is applicable to the rental income derived by an individual as a result of renting out residential space to an organisation, legal entity, or an individual for residential purposes if the individual does not make deductions from this income.
Starting from 1 January 2023 until 1 January 2026, income derived by an individual as a result of conducting economic activity classified by statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community under group 55.2 - Holiday and other short-stay accommodation is subject to fixed PIT rate if one:
  * applies to the tax office
  * is not voluntarily registered as a VAT payer, and
  * earned income from this activity not exceeding GEL 100,000 in any consecutive 12-months period.


A non-resident individual earning rental income from the person having no liability to act as a tax agent and withhold taxes is subject to PIT on the difference between the Georgian-source income earned during a calendar year and deductions related to the receipt of such income.
