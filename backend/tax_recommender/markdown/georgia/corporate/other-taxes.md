## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 18% and applies to the supply of all goods and services for consideration on the territory of Georgia within the scope of economic activities.
Goods are considered to be supplied in Georgia if they are located on the Georgian territory upon its transfer. If the supply of goods is accompanied by transportation, then the place of supply is considered in Georgia if its shipment originates in Georgia.
Under the general rule, place of supply of services depends on whether it is business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) supply, as follows:
  * In case of B2B supplies, the place where the service recipient or its fixed establishment is located is considered as the place of service delivery.
  * In case of B2C supplies, the place where the supplier or its fixed establishment is located is deemed the place of service delivery.


However, in relation to certain types of services, place of B2C supplies is determined based on the location of the recipient. Such services, among others, include telecommunication services, electronically supplied services, advertising, consulting, financial services, insurance services, etc.
Additionally, special place of supply rules apply for services related to immovable and movable property, transportation services, catering, leisure activities, etc.
A person established in Georgia must register as a VAT payer when its taxable turnover exceeds 100,000 Georgian lari (GEL) in any continuous 12-month period. Georgian fixed establishment of a foreign taxable person is liable for VAT registration from the beginning of taxable operations.
Generally, VAT is chargeable at the moment of supply of goods and services. VAT is also applied on the advances received on goods and services to be supplied.
The taxable amount is determined based on the received/receivable consideration.
VAT-exempt supplies include financial services, goods and services required for oil and gas operations, certain medical and education services, etc.
Reverse-charge VAT applies to services provided to Georgian VAT payers by a non-resident VATable person. Also from April 2021, non-Georgian businesses providing digital services to Georgian consumers are required to register in Georgia and comply with VAT liabilities.
