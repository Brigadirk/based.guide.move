## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December. Companies with financial periods other than the calendar year are taxed on their financial period ending during the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Companies are expected to submit a tax return not later than four months after the end of the financial year. They may file an application for extension of filing time for not more than two months.
## Payment of tax
CIT is due for payment at the same time as the due date for filing the return. The tax is payable in four equal instalments at the end of each quarter (i.e. March, June, September, and December) in each year of assessment, but such payments are not deemed to be the actual tax payable.
At the end of the year, all taxpayers are required to file final tax returns and pay any tax outstanding. The final return and tax are due within four months after the financial year-end.
There are also instances where the Commissioner-General of the GRA may issue an additional assessment after conduct of an audit. Where such assessment is served, the tax is payable within 30 days after service of the notice. At the discretion of the Commissioner-General of the GRA, the time for payment may be extended.
### Penalties
Where tax is not paid by the due date, a penalty is calculated at 125% of the statutory rate, compounded monthly, and applied to the amount outstanding at the start of the period.
## Tax audit process
The GRA assesses taxpayers on a regular basis. The tax laws give powers to persons authorised by the Commissioner-General of the GRA to gain full and unlimited access to the taxpayersâ€™ premises, records, and electronic information. Industries such as mining, upstream oil and gas, and financial institutions are more likely to be selected for a tax audit. Also, request for a tax refund is also likely to lead to a tax audit. The GRA usually gives notice of its intention to perform a tax audit and, after performance, prepares a report on its findings, which is then shared with the taxpayer.
## Statute of limitations
The Revenue Administration Act, 2016 (Act 915) (RAA) requires all taxable persons to maintain records of all receipts and payments, revenue and expenditure, and all assets and liabilities for a period of not less than six years. This is in conjunction with the fact that the Statute of Limitation bars actions to recover tax after 12 years.
## Automatic exchange of financial account information
The Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information Act, 2018 (Act 967) imposes on financial institutions an obligation to report to the GRA information regarding certain financial accounts of an individual or entity and conduct due diligence with respect to those financial accounts.
The reporting financial institution is required to submit an annual report no later than six months following the end of the calendar year to which the report relates.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of focus for the tax authorities include:
  * tax refunds
  * reconciliations of returns to financial records
  * anti-avoidance arrangements, and 
  * transfer pricing.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
A company is resident if it is incorporated under the laws of Ghana or has its management and control exercised in Ghana at any time during a year of assessment.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Income Tax Act, 2015 (Act 896) (ITA) recognises both Ghanaian PE and foreign PE.
A Ghanaian PE includes:
  * a place in the country where a non-resident person carries on business or that is at the disposal of the person for that purpose
  * a place in the country where a person has, is using, or is installing substantial equipment or substantial machinery
  * a place in the country where a person is engaged in a construction, assembly, or installation project for 90 days or more, including a place where a person is conducting supervisory activities in relation to that project, or
  * the provision of services in the country.


A foreign PE means a fixed place of business situated in a foreign country where the business is conducted continuously for at least six months but excludes any place at which only activities of a preparatory or auxiliary nature are conducted.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
## Depreciation and depletion
Depreciation of depreciable assets in the accounts of a business is not an allowable deduction in computing taxable profits. It is instead replaced by capital allowances at prescribed statutory rates, as follows:
Class | Assets | Rate  
---|---|---  
1 | Assets pooled (allowance calculated on a reducing-balance basis). Mainly computers and data handling equipment together with peripheral devices. | 40%  
2 | Assets pooled (allowance calculated on a reducing-balance basis). Mainly automobiles, buses, mini buses, construction and earth-moving equipment, trailers and trailer-mounted containers, plant and machinery used in manufacturing. | 30%  
3 | Assets pooled (allowance calculated on a reducing-balance basis). Mainly railroad cars, locomotives and equipment, vessels and similar water transportation equipment, aircraft, public utility plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and any other depreciable asset not elsewhere classified. | 20%  
4 | Buildings, structures, and similar works of a permanent nature (allowance calculated using the straight-line method). | 10%  
5 | Intangible assets. | Useful life  
Mining and petroleum expenditure (allowance calculated using the straight-line method). | 20%  
Machinery and equipment imported in order to affix the excise tax stamp on excisable goods by an importer or manufacturer of excisable goods (allowance calculated using the straight-line method). | 50%  
Allowances are granted only on the following conditions:
  * The taxpayer must own the asset.
  * Capital expenditure must be incurred.
  * The asset must be used in the trade.
  * The asset must be in use up to the end of the basis period.
  * Capital allowances are granted for every year in which the asset is in use. Balancing allowances and charges are made, as the case may be, on disposal of the asset.


For intangibles, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights, the law allows for capital allowance deduction over the useful life of the asset.
## Start-up expenses and pre-operating costs
Although the tax law does not specifically mention start-up expenses or pre-operating costs, generally a deduction is allowed for start-up and pre-operating costs incurred by a business, provided such expenses are wholly, exclusively, and necessarily incurred in the production of income of the taxpayer.
## Interest expenses
Interest incurred on loans used to generate the income of a business is ordinarily deductible. Restrictions apply on interest payments on related loans. _See Thin capitalisation in the section_
## Financial costs
Deductions for financial costs other than interest are limited to the sum of:
  * financial gains derived by the person that are to be included in calculating the income of the person from the investment or business for the year of assessment, and
  * 50% of the chargeable income of the person for the year from the business or investment calculated without including financial gains derived by the person or financial costs incurred by the person.


## Bad debts
A deduction is allowed for bad debts incurred in the normal course of business, other than advances made on capital accounts. A bad debt is allowed as a deduction if the Commissioner-General of the GRA is satisfied that the taxpayer has taken all reasonable steps to pursue payment and the person reasonably believes payment will not be made.
Any amounts recovered in respect of a bad debt previously written off should be included in income and subject to tax accordingly.
An existing debt that becomes a bad debt after a 50% or more change in underlying ownership is not allowed as a bad debt deduction after the change in ownership has taken place.
## Charitable contributions
The following contributions/donations are allowable as deductions in ascertaining the taxable income of a person:
  * Contributions made to a charitable institution or fund approved by the government.
  * Payments towards a scholarship scheme approved by the government for a technical, professional, or other course of study.
  * Donations made for the purpose of any rural or urban area and approved by the government.
  * Donations for the purpose of sports development approved by the government.
  * Donations to the government for worthwhile government causes approved by the Commissioner-General of the GRA.


## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties arising as a result of non-compliance with the provisions of the tax law are generally not allowable deductions.
## Taxes
Any income taxes, profit taxes, or other similar taxes are not deductible in determining taxable income.
## Other significant items
No other special deductions are allowed. Principal non-deductible expenses include the following:
  * Domestic or private expenses, including cost of travel between residence and place of business or employment.
  * Any disbursement or expense not being wholly and exclusively paid or expended for the purpose of acquiring income.
  * Capital withdrawn or any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital.
  * Capital employed in improvement.
  * Any sum recoverable under an insurance contract of indemnity.
  * Rent of or any expense in connection with premises or a part of premises not occupied or used for the purpose of producing business income.
  * Any payment to a savings or other society or fund unless specifically allowed by the Commissioner-General of the GRA.
  * Unrealised foreign exchange losses.
  * Foreign exchange losses on transactions with resident persons. 


## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for all sectors and deducted from assessable income for the five years immediately following the year in which the loss was incurred. 
Carryback of losses is permitted for persons deriving income relating to a long-term contract (except where there is a more than 50% change in underlying ownership within a period of three years).
A long-term contract of a business includes a contract for manufacture, installation, or construction that is not completed within the company's accounting year in which it is commenced.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
The Transfer Pricing Regulations 2020, (L.I. 2412) require that payments or transactions between persons in a controlled relationship are conducted at arm's length. A transaction is conducted at armâ€™s length between persons in a controlled relationship if the terms of the transaction do not differ from the terms of a comparable transaction between independent persons. The Commissioner-General of the GRA may disregard or disallow transactions if they are deemed to be fictitious or do not have a substantial economic effect and the form does not reflect its substance.
A person is deemed to be in a controlled relationship with an entity where the person has, directly or indirectly, at least 25% of the voting rights of the entity. 


# Ghana
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
No form of combined reporting of results of operations by a group or affiliates is permitted.
## Transfer pricing
The Transfer Pricing Regulations follow the internationally accepted guidelines published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), only with a much broader perspective on the nature of entities and transactions.
The Regulations cover transactions between persons in a controlled relationship (i.e. related parties, including PEs and employees). They prescribe the transfer pricing methods and documentation that entities are required to maintain and retain.
The Regulations also require entities with related-party transactions to file a return, supporting documentation, and country-by-country report on an annual basis. 
## Thin capitalisation
Interest expenses and foreign exchange currency losses incurred on related-party debt by an entity (other than a financial institution) in which 50% or more of the underlying ownership or control is held by an exempt person, either alone or together with an associate, are not allowed as a deduction in arriving at the chargeable income of the entity if the entity is thinly capitalised. An entity controlled by an exempt person is deemed to be thinly capitalised if its debt-to-equity ratio exceeds the ratio 3:1.
Thin capitalisation provisions do not apply to resident financial institutions.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no provisions for CFCs in the tax laws of Ghana.


# Ghana
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
The CIT rate on branch profits is the same as that on corporate profits.
However, a non-resident person that conducts activities in Ghana through a branch pays tax at 8% on earned repatriated profits, payable within 30 days. The portion of net profit of the resident person that corresponds to interest of the non-resident shareholders is treated as repatriated profits. The repatriated profit is also treated as a dividend distributed in accordance with the respective shares of the non-resident person.


# Ghana
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024

## Corporate - Other issues
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
## Local content and local participation regulations
The Minerals and Mining General Regulations 2012 (L.I. 2173) applicable to mining entities obligate mining contractors and subcontractors to conform to the requirements for recruitment of expatriates, train Ghanaians, and give preference to local products and services in their operations.
The Petroleum (Local Content and Local Participation) Regulations, 2013 (L.I. 2204) aim at providing a transparent monitoring system to meet the objectives of the governmentâ€™s Local Content Policy. Further, the Regulations are expected to help facilitate job creation through the use of local expertise for goods and services, business, and financing in the petroleum industry value chain.
The Energy Commission (Local Content and Local Participation) (Electricity Supply Industry) Regulations, 2017 (L.I. 2354) compels businesses operating in the electricity supply industry (including renewable energy) to comply with the defined percentages of Ghanaian equity ownership, utilisation of local human and material resources, and services in their businesses.
## Ring fencing for mining and petroleum entities
In determining the chargeable income for a basis period, mining companies are not able to deduct expenses incurred in one mining area against revenue from another mining area.
Similarly, companies engaged in petroleum operations are required to treat the activities of a petroleum right as an independent activity separately from other rights.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Section 11 of the ITA provides general guidance on the principles of stock (inventory) valuation for income tax purposes. A person making a determination of the cost of trading stock is required to use the absorption cost method. The owner of a trading stock or other fungible assets may determine the cost of that asset by using the first in first out (FIFO) method or the average cost method. The closing value of inventory is valued for tax purposes at the lower of cost or market value.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are included as part of income and taxed at the applicable CIT rate.
A person who realises an asset or liability is required to file a return, in the form prescribed by the Commissioner-General of the GRA, within 30 days after the realisation. 
## Dividend income
A dividend paid to a resident company by another resident company is exempt from tax where the company receiving the dividend controls, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividend.
### Stock dividends
The issue of stock dividends is permitted under Section 77 of the Companies Act, 2019 (Act 992). It is, however, subject to income tax at the dividend withholding tax (WHT) rate of 8%.
## Interest income
Interest received by a resident company from another resident company is subject to WHT at a rate of 8%.
However, WHT does not apply to interest received by a resident financial institution.
## Royalty income
Royalty income received by a company is included in the investment income and taxed at the applicable corporate tax rate with a general rate of 25%.
### Mineral royalties
The mineral royalty rate is 5% of the total revenue earned from minerals (excluding petroleum and water) obtained from mining operations by a holder of a mining lease, restricted mining lease, or small-scale mining licence.
## Exempt income
Specific exemptions from tax include the following:
  * Income of a local authority.
  * Income of a statutory or registered building society where only individuals are eligible to be members and the organisation does not engage in political party activities.
  * Non-business income of a charitable organisation.
  * Pensions.

# Ghana
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
A resident person's worldwide income is assessed for tax. Income from business and investment (from both Ghanaian and foreign sources) is included in determining the resident personâ€™s assessable income.
The business and investment income of a non-resident person is included in the assessable income for a year of assessment if that income has a source in Ghana. Where a non-resident person has a Ghanaian permanent establishment (PE), any income connected with the PE is assessed to tax.
The general corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 25%.
Mining and upstream petroleum companies pay CIT at a rate of 35%, while companies principally engaged in the hotel industry pay a reduced rate of 22%.
The CIT rate for companies engaged in non-traditional exports is 8%, while banks lending to the agricultural and leasing sectors pay a CIT rate of 20% on income from those businesses. Lottery operators are also subject to a 20% income tax on gross gaming revenue. 
A person may pay tax on a minimum chargeable income of 5% of turnover where that person has been declaring tax losses for the previous five years of assessment. This excludes persons:
  * within the first five years of commencement of operations, and
  * engaged in farming.


## Growth and Sustainability Levy (GSL)
The GSL applies to entities to raise revenue for growth and fiscal sustainability of the economy. Entities are categorised into three groups and are required to pay the levy as follows:
Category  | Rate of levy  
---|---  
**Category A**
  1. Banks
  2. Non-bank financial institutions
  3. Insurance companies
  4. Telecommunications companies liable to collect and pay the Communications Service Tax under the Communications Service Tax Act, 2008 (Act 754)
  5. Breweries
  6. Inspection and valuation companies
  7. Companies providing mining support services
  8. Bulk oil distributors
  9. Oil marketing companies
  10. Communication tower operators
  11. Companies providing upstream petroleum services
  12. Companies and institutions registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
  13. Specialised deposit-taking institutions
  14. Electronic money issuers
  15. Shipping lines, maritime, and airport terminals

| 5% of profit before tax  
**Category B** Mining companies and upstream oil and gas companies | 1% of gross production  
**Category C** All other entities not falling within category A or B | 2.5% of profit before tax  
The GSL applies to an entity irrespective of any existing tax holiday or exemption granted to the entity under any agreement or enactment.
The levy is payable in four equal instalments and at the end of each quarter of the year of assessment (i.e. 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December). An entity is required to file a return as determined by the Commissioner-General of the GRA. The amount payable is not a deductible expense for CIT purposes. 
The GSL is applicable to profits before tax or production for the 2023 to 2025 years of assessment. 
## Financial sector recovery levy (FSRL)
The FSRL applies to banks (other than rural or community banks) to raise revenue to support the financial sector reforms.
It is a 5% levy on the profit before tax of the affected banks. The levy is not an allowable deduction in calculating the chargeable income of the bank. 
The FSRL is payable on a quarterly basis during the year (i.e. by 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December). It is expected to expire at the end of 2024.
## Local income taxes
Ghana has no local, state, or provincial government taxes on income. However, other local authority bodies (i.e. District Assembly/Municipal Authority) may also apply levies based on location of business properties.


# Ghana
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Other than exempt goods and services, VAT is charged on the following:
  * Supply of goods and services made in Ghana.
  * Importation of goods.


The standard VAT rate is 15%. However, supplies of a retailer of goods whose annual turnover is at least GHS 200,000 but does not exceed GHS 500,000 are taxed at a flat rate of 3%.
A flat rate of 5% is also applicable on the taxable supply of immovable property by a taxable person:
  * for rental purposes other than for accommodation in a dwelling or in a commercial rental establishment, or
  * who is an estate developer.


VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services where the supply is a taxable supply and made by a taxable person in the course of business.
Taxable persons or VAT-registered persons are required to issue tax invoices through the Certified Invoicing System (CIS). This requires the integration of the taxpayer's system with that of the GRA.
VAT is payable by the taxable person making the supply in the case of taxable supply and by the importer in the case of imported goods.
Most professional services are also subject to the same VAT rate, including the following:
  * Management services.
  * Insurance brokerage and other services.
  * Financial, tax, and economic consulting.
  * Engineering and technical services.
  * Accounting services.
  * Courier services.
  * Legal services.
  * Provision of satellite television.
  * Architectural services.
  * Services rendered by surveyors.


Exports of goods and services are zero-rated. Unless specifically exempt, supplies of all goods and services are subject to VAT.
A person entitled to relief is required to pay the tax and apply for refund unless otherwise directed by the Minister responsible for finance.
The GRAâ€™s appointed VAT-registered withholding agents are expected to withhold 7% of the taxable value of goods and services when making payments for supplies subject to VAT at the standard rate of 15%.
## National health insurance levy (NHIL), Ghana education trust fund levy (GETFL), and COVID-19 health recovery levy (CHRL)
Unless otherwise exempted or zero-rated, NHIL of 2.5%, GETFL of 2.5%, and CHRL of 1% are charged on the following:
  * Supply of goods and services provided in Ghana.
  * Importation of goods.

## Customs and excise duties
Customs and excise duties are imposed on the importation of goods at the port of entry and certain manufactured goods produced or imported into Ghana.
The following rates of excise duties apply on the ex-factory price:
Product | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Sachet water | 0  
Bottled water | 17.5  
Mineral and aerated water, non-alcoholic beer and drinks, energy drinks, and fruit juices | 20  
Malt drink | 10 to 20  
Beer | 10 to 47.5  
Wines | 45  
Spirits | 0 to 50  
Cigars, cigarettes, electronic cigarette liquids, electronic cigarettes, and electronic smoking devices  | 50  
Plastic and plastic products | 5  
Textiles and pharmaceuticals | 0  
The excise duty payable on malt drinks, beer, and stout, other than indigenous beer, is determined by the percentage of local raw materials used. Local raw materials do not include water. The excise duty applicable on cigarettes, cigars, and tobacco products is a blend of both ad-valorem and specific excise taxes. Electronic cigarette liquids are subject to specific excise duty. 
In accordance with the Excise Tax Stamp Act, 2013 (Act 873), qualifying excisable products that are imported or locally manufactured are required to be affixed with tax stamps specified and supplied by the GRA before they are delivered ex-factory, cleared from any port of entry, or sold at any commercial level.
The affected products are:
  * All cigarettes and other tobacco products.
  * Alcoholic beverages whether bottled, canned, contained in kegs for sale, or packaged in any form.
  * Non-alcoholic carbonated beverages whether bottled, canned, or packaged in any form.
  * Bottled water.
  * Textiles.
  * Any other excisable product prescribed by the Minister of Finance.


In addition, the Special Import Levy Act, 2013 (Act 861) imposes a levy of 2% on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of certain imported goods.
The African Union Import Levy Act, 2017 (Act 952) also imposes a levy of 0.2% on the CIF value of eligible imports from Non-African Union Countries.
## Property taxes
Property taxes are payable by owners of immovable property to the local District Assembly/Municipal Authority. The rate of property tax differs depending on the location of the property.
## Stamp taxes
Stamp duty is paid, at rates typically ranging between 0.25% to 1% and GHS 18 to GHS 896.30, depending on the type of transaction and the instrument. A stamp duty of 1% applies on the initial stated capital and any subsequent increase in the stated capital.
The stamp duty is not a tax on transactions but on documents brought into being for the purposes of recording transactions. It is therefore a tax on documents or specific instruments that have legal effect, such as the following:
  * Insurance policies.
  * Awards of cost in matters of dispute.
  * Conveyances or transfers on the sale of any property.
  * Appointment letters of new trustees.
  * Natural resource leases or licences (e.g. mining, timber).
  * Agreements or memoranda of agreement.
  * Bills of exchange (e.g. issue of cheques).
  * Bills of lading.


## Payroll taxes
Employers are required to withhold tax (pay-as-you-earn or PAYE) on employeesâ€™ salaries and other emoluments, including benefits in kind, on a monthly basis at the graduated rates, with the highest rate at 35% for tax resident employees. A flat rate of 25% is applicable on the salaries and other emolument of non-resident employees. Employers are to remit the withheld taxes to the GRA by the 15th day of the subsequent month.
Failure to withhold the tax and remit to the GRA on the due date attracts an interest penalty of 125% of the statutory rate, compounded monthly and applied to the amount outstanding at the start of the period.
Employers are also required to file annual returns of employees by 30 April of the year following the year to which the returns relate.
## Social security contributions
The social security contribution scheme is structured into three tiers, with the first two requiring mandatory contributions and the last one being voluntary. The employee is required to contribute 5.5% with the employer contributing 13%. Of the total contribution of 18.5%, 13.5% is contributed to the first-tier and 5% to the second-tier schemes.
## Communications service tax (CST)
CST of 5% is levied on charges payable by both individual and corporate users of electronic communication services (ECS) provided by service providers other than private electronic communication services. The levy is also applicable to any form of recharge and is payable once a person makes a payment for ECS regardless of whether or not that person is authorised or permitted to provide ECS under the Electronic Communication Act (Act 755). Note that the definition of electronic communication includes interconnection.
## Emissions levy
An emissions levy is imposed on the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from specified sectors and emissions from vehicles. The levy payable is as follows:
  * Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from the construction, manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and electricity and heating sectors: GHS 100 per tonne of emissions per month.
  * Emissions from motor vehicles: GHS 75 to GHS 300 _per annum_ depending on the internal combustion engine vehicles.


## Local business permits
Business â€˜permitsâ€™ are payable annually to local District Assemblies or Municipal Authorities. The amount is dependent on the physical location where the business activity is conducted. It is therefore possible that if a taxpayer operates from two business locations in different regions, such permits would be paid to two different local authorities.
