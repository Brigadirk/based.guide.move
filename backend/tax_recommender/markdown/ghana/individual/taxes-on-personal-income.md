## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
Ghana taxes its resident individuals on income from any employment, business, or investment, whether or not the source from which the income is derived has ceased.
Resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, and, as such, foreign-sourced income is taxable.
However, an exemption exists for employment income of a resident individual who exercises one's employment outside Ghana and is employed by a non-resident employer or by a resident employer, where that individual is present outside Ghana for more than 183 days.
The following are examples of income from employment, business, and investment a resident individual is taxed on:
  * Gains and profits from any employment, including any allowances and benefits paid in cash or given in kind to or on behalf of an employee other than in respect of a reimbursement of an expense of an employee used in relation to the employment, medical or dental cost, or any passage from or to Ghana, and redundancy pay.
  * Gains or profits from trade, business, profession, or vocation.
  * Gains from realisation of assets and liabilities.
  * Gifts.
  * Dividends.
  * Any charge or annuity.
  * Royalties, premiums, and any other profits arising from property.
  * Receipts, including royalties or periodic or deferred payments, of any kind derived from any transaction wherever and whenever made, affecting directly or indirectly, and/or from any natural resources in Ghana, and notwithstanding whether the receipts are paid within or outside Ghana.
  * Non-residents are liable to Ghanaian income tax on any income derived in Ghana from any trade, business, profession, or vocation, or which is derived from an employment exercised in Ghana.
