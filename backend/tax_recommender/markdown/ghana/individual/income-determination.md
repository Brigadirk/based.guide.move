## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 03 December 2024
## Employment income
Total emoluments paid to an employee or on the employeeâ€™s behalf are included in the chargeable income of the employee for any year of assessment. All cash allowances for housing and entertainment are taxable, but reimbursements for expenses actually incurred exclusively on behalf of and for the benefit of the employer are not taxable to the employee.
Chargeable income also includes any benefit derived from the use of a motor vehicle, furnishing, or accommodation provided by the employer. There are no concessions for foreigners.
### Non-cash benefits
Non-cash benefits received from employment, except where specifically exempt, are taxable.
Generally, the value of any non-cash benefits is the market value of the benefit, determined on the date that the benefit is taken into account for tax purposes.
Accommodation facilities and vehicle-related benefits are valued as follows:
Facility provided | Quantification of benefit   
---|---  
Provision of accommodation | Value (% of total cash emolument)  
Accommodation with furnishings | 10%  
Accommodation only | 7.5%  
Furnishing only | 2.5%  
Shared accommodation | 2.5%  
Provision of means of transport | Value (% of total cash emolument)  
Driver and vehicle with fuel | 12.5% up to GHS 1,500 per month  
Vehicle with fuel | 10% up to GHS 1,250 per month  
Vehicle only | 5% up to GHS 625 per month  
Fuel only | 5% up to GHS 625 per month  
## Capital gains
Capital gains are included in chargeable income or taxed at a separate rate upon election. _See Capital gains tax in the section for more information_.
## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to a final withholding tax (WHT) of 8% to both residents and non-residents. For non-residents, this will also depend on the provisions of a double tax treaty (DTT) that may exist.
## Interest income
Interest income to individuals by a resident financial institution is exempt from tax. Likewise, the payment of interest to individuals on bonds issued by the government, including interest on treasury bills, is tax exempt.
