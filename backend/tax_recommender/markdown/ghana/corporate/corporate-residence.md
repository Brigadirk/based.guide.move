The Income Tax Act, 2015 (Act 896) (ITA) recognises both Ghanaian PE and foreign PE.
A Ghanaian PE includes:
  * a place in the country where a non-resident person carries on business or that is at the disposal of the person for that purpose
  * a place in the country where a person has, is using, or is installing substantial equipment or substantial machinery
  * a place in the country where a person is engaged in a construction, assembly, or installation project for 90 days or more, including a place where a person is conducting supervisory activities in relation to that project, or
  * the provision of services in the country.


A foreign PE means a fixed place of business situated in a foreign country where the business is conducted continuously for at least six months but excludes any place at which only activities of a preparatory or auxiliary nature are conducted.
