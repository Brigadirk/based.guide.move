## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Depreciation
Depreciation is considered a deductible cost with respect to all fixed assets (except land), up to the limits determined by the applicable tax law.
As a general rule, depreciation must be computed by using the straight-line method. Tax authorities may allow other depreciation methods on the basis that the actual depreciation is higher than the one calculated at regular rates or according to the taxpayer's accounting practice.
Under the straight-line method, the maximum depreciation that is deductible is calculated by applying the general depreciation rates set out by the Decree No. 42/2015, of 24 August, to the adjusted purchase cost or production cost.
Land is not depreciable.
### Main depreciation rates for tangible assets
Group | Asset | Depreciation rate (%)

## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses include, among others, cost incurred with set-up and organisation of companies, projects, and increase of capital. Start-up expenses are considered a deductible cost up to the limits derived from the applicable tax law, 33.33% per year being deductible over a period of three years.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible if considered indispensable for the realisation of taxable profits/gains (_see Limitation on the tax deductibility of net financing expenses in the section_).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are those where the related recovery risk is considered to be justified. According to the CIT Code, the recovery risk is justified whenever there is a:
  * Company insolvency and recovery proceeding and enforcement procedure.
  * Law court or arbitration court claimed debt.
  * Overdue debt.


The deduction for tax purposes of impairment losses on overdue debt is subject to the following limits, computed on the amount of the debt:

Debt overdue | More than 6 and up to 12 months | 25  
More than 12 and up to 18 months | 50  
More than 18 and up to 24 months | 75  
More than 24 months | 100  
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions granted to certain entities whose main activity consists of the execution of initiatives in the social, cultural, environmental, scientific or technological, sports, and educational areas are considered as cost for tax purposes (within certain limits, and in certain circumstances, with an additional deduction).
## Fines and penalties
Tax fines and penalties are not deductible for tax purposes. Contractual fines and penalties are deductible for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Taxes paid in connection with the activity of the company are tax deductible, excluding CIT and autonomous taxation. The annual IUP cannot be deducted as a cost for CIT purposes.
## Net operating losses
Income tax losses can be offset against taxable profit, capped at 50% of the taxable profit. Carryback of tax losses is not allowed in Cabo Verde.
According to the transitional regime, tax losses generated before 2015 can be carried forward for three years without limit.
From 2024 onwards, tax losses available can be carried forward for an unlimited period.
The tax losses incurred by a company are not transferable to another company unless previously accepted by the tax authorities.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Currently, there are no special restrictions on the deductibility of royalties, interest, and service fees paid to foreign affiliates, provided that the payments are regarded as indispensable to generate taxable profits and gains and to maintain the business of the company.
Payments made to foreign affiliates located in a favourable tax regime are not accepted as deductible tax costs unless it can be demonstrated that the payment is a necessary cost and is not an exaggerated amount (i.e. it should be demonstrated that it is an acceptable/normal amount).

When the regime comes to an end or when one company ceases to qualify for this regime, the tax losses obtained during the regime cannot be carried forward and deducted against future individual taxable income of the companies. The parent company is responsible for demonstrating that the requirements for the application of the group taxation regime are met.

## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Taxable income is computed on the basis of the accounting income, adjusted by deducting from taxable profits the prior years' losses and any deductions under the tax (incentive) legislation.
## Inventory valuation
The tax law does not foresee any mandatory inventory valuation method that should be adopted by Cabo Verde taxpayers. For tax purposes, accepted inventory methods should be consistent with the accounting rules in force and with generally accepted local business practice. Such methods should be applied in a consistent manner over the financial years and based on the prices effectively paid or established by official documents (for regulated prices).
## Capital gains
Capital gains are not subject to a separate capital gains tax and are treated and taxed as ordinary business income.
Capital gains and capital losses determined for tax purposes are usually different from capital gains and capital losses determined for accounting purposes and are quantified as follows:
Capital gains/losses = sales - (acquisition value - deductible accumulated depreciation - deductible impairment losses) x coefficient
Capital gains can be considered only in 50% of the respective amount if the sales proceeds are reinvested in the acquisition, production, or construction of tangible fixed assets, intangible assets, or non-consumable biological assets. For this purpose, the reinvestment must take place in the previous tax year, in the tax year in which the transfer occurs, or in the two tax years following the transfer.
In case of partial reinvestment, a partial relief (proportional to the investment made) will apply. In case the reinvestment is not fully accomplished during the reinvestment period, the difference (or the proportional difference) will be considered as taxable income of the second year following the disposal, increased by 15%.
Capital gains on the sale of share capital or other equity instruments, owned for a period of not less than 12 months, obtained by a resident or non-resident with a PE in Cabo Verde are exempt from CIT. This benefit does not apply to capital gains on the sale of share capital acquired from entities that are subject to a more favourable tax regime. The exemption also does not apply on capital gains arising on the transfer of shareholdings in a company in which more than 50% of the assets owned are composed, directly or indirectly, of real estate located in Cabo Verde (it includes the gains derived from the respective transfer for a consideration).
Capital gains on the sale of share capital or other securities obtained by non-resident entities without a PE in Cabo Verde are also exempt from CIT. This exemption does not apply on capital gains arising on the transfer of shareholdings in a company in which more than 50% of the assets owned are composed, directly or indirectly, of real estate located in Cabo Verde (it includes the gains derived from the respective transfer for a consideration).
## Dividend income
The tax legislation provides a full relief from taxation on profit distribution at the beneficiary level, without any requirements to be met by the entities involved, except for entities with a local CIT rate reduction, for which the tax relief is only 50%.
## Interest income
There is no special tax provision regarding interest income. Interest income is treated and taxed as ordinary business income (excluding interest from bonds or similar products listed in the securities market).
## Royalty income
The term ‘royalties’ is not defined as such in Cabo Verde’s principal tax law, but the relevant regulations define royalties as “income from intellectual, industrial copyrights, or from an experience acquired in an industrial, commercial, or scientific area, as well as income from technical assistance and from the use of commercial, industrial, or scientific equipment”.
## Foreign income
Resident companies are subject to taxation on foreign income. Cabo Verde tax law allows a foreign tax credit to mitigate the double taxation on foreign income taxed in another jurisdiction (_see Foreign tax credit in the section_).
PEs of non-resident companies are taxable on a territorial base principle, meaning that income obtained outside Cabo Verde is not subject to taxation therein.


# Cabo Verde
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Cabo Verde's CIT, called _Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Colectivas_ , is levied both on profits obtained within the Cabo Verde territory and those obtained outside by resident companies (worldwide principle). Non-resident companies with a permanent establishment (PE) in Cabo Verde are also subject to CIT on Cabo Verde-source income attributable to the PE.
Taxable profit is computed according to the local accounting rules and adjusted for tax purposes.
For the purposes of determining taxable income, CIT payers can be taxed under two methods/regimes as follows:
  * Special regime for micro and small-sized companies: 
    * Micro-sized company: An entity that employs up to five persons with an annual turnover (gross amount of sales and services) that does not exceed CVE 5 million.
    * Small-sized company: An entity that employs between six and ten persons with an annual turnover (gross amount of sales and services) of between CVE 5 million and CVE 10 million.
    * Micro and small importers: Importers whose customs value of imported goods does not exceed the value of turnover on an annual basis for the purpose of qualifying under the simplified scheme for micro and small-sized companies.
  * Standard organised accounting regime (standard/normal regime under which the computation of profits follows the local accounting rules).


## Income tax rates
Resident companies are subject to a tax rate of 21%, where taxable income corresponds to the profit less any tax benefits and any losses carried forward, as stated in the tax return. The tax rate of 21% is also applicable for PEs of non-resident companies.
Micro and small-sized companies are subject to a single special tax (SST) of 4% levied on the gross amount of sales obtained in each taxable year, to be paid quarterly. The SST replaces the CIT, fire brigade surtax, and VAT, as well as the contribution to social security attributable to the company.
Non-resident companies without a PE are subject to withholding tax (WHT) rates applicable for each income category foreseen in the Tax Code, which range between 1% and 20%.
## Surcharge
The CIT rate is increased by a fire brigade surcharge, called _Taxa de Incêndio_ , of 2% on the tax due, leading to a final tax rate of 21.42%. This surcharge is levied in the municipalities of Praia (Island of Santiago) and Mindelo (Island of São Vicente).

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT system in Cabo Verde closely follows the European Union (EU) VAT system and is assessed at the standard rate of 15%.
The standard VAT rate of 15% is a general tax on consumption, applicable to the import and sale of goods and services in Cabo Verde territory.
The VAT rate on the supply of electricity and water to private consumers is 8%.
The taxable base for the following supplies of goods and services, which price is determined by public authorities, is:
  * Diesel: 100%.
  * Fuel: 100%.
  * Petroleum: 10%.
  * Butane gas: 16.65%.
  * Fuel-oil: 100%.
  * Electricity: 100%.
  * Tap water from the public supply: 100%.
  * Telecommunication services: 100%.


  * Road passenger transport and transport of goods by sea: 100%.


  * Maritime transport of goods: 100%.


The following transactions are considered to fall outside the scope of VAT:
  * The transfer, for consideration or not, of a totality of assets or a part thereof that constitute an undertaking or a part of an undertaking capable of carrying on an independent economic activity.


  * Amounts received as compensation declared judicially for total or partial breach of contracts.
  * Discounts, allowances, or bonuses granted.
  * Amounts paid on behalf of the acquirer of the goods or the recipient of the services.


  * Amounts related to packaging, provided they have not been effectively transacted.


### Exempt transactions
The VAT regulations establish two types of exempt transactions: exempt transactions without credit and exempt transactions with credit (i.e. zero-rated transactions). VAT incurred is recoverable in as far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of the taxed transactions of a taxable person or for zero-rated transactions.
Exempt transactions without credit include the following:
  * Hospital and medical care and closely related activities undertaken by hospitals and centres for medical treatment.
  * The provision of medical care through the exercise of their respective professions by physicians, dentists, nurses, and other paramedics, as well as the supply of transport services for sick or injured persons, and the supply of human organs, blood, and milk.
  * The supply of services and goods closely linked to welfare and social security work.
  * The supply of services and goods closely linked to the protection of children and young people by bodies governed by public law.
  * The provision of children's or young people's education, school or university education, including the supply of services and goods closely related thereto.
  * The supply of services, and goods closely linked thereto, by non-profit organisations.
  * The supply of copyright and art objects by the original creators or their heirs.
  * The supply by the public postal services of stamps and stamped paper.
  * The supply of certain cultural, educational, technical, and recreational services.
  * Garbage removal services.
  * Burial and cremation supplies.
  * Banking, financial, insurance, and reinsurance transactions, including related services performed by insurance brokers and insurance agents.
  * Immovable property transactions (excluding the provision of accommodation in the hotel sector or in sectors with a similar function, the granting of facilities for collective parking of vehicles, the leasing of permanently installed machinery and equipment, and the granting of facilities for exhibitions and advertising).


Exempt transactions with credit (i.e. zero-rated transaction) on imports include the following:
  * Supply of essential goods foreseen in Annex I of the VAT Code (e.g. meat, fish, and milk).


  * Import of goods whose supply qualifies for exemption.
  * Re-import of goods by the person who exported them, in the state in which they were exported, where they qualify for exemption from customs duties.
  * Services in connection with the import of goods where the value of such services is included in the taxable amount.
  * Import of gold by the central bank.
  * Import into ports by sea fishing undertakings of their catches, unprocessed or after undergoing preservation for marketing but before being supplied.
  * Import of goods under diplomatic and consular arrangements that qualify for exemption from customs duties.
  * Import of goods for the fuelling and provisioning of sea-going vessels and aircraft.


### **Invoicing**
Since June 2021, it has been progressively mandatory to issue electronic invoices.
In recent years, Cape Verden Tax Law has established the concept of 'invoices issued in legal form' that confer the right to deduct input VAT as to foresee only invoices issued electronically.
A self-billing regime has been introduced, ensuring the possibility of the acquirer to issue an invoice in the name or on behalf of the supplier of goods or services, under certain conditions.
### Special VAT regime for e-commerce
The special VAT regime for e-commerce aims at taxing in the Cabo Verde territory distance selling of goods and the provision of services by taxpayers without a head office, PE, or domicile in Cabo Verde, whenever the acquirer has a head office, PE, or domicile in the national territory. The regime does not apply to remittances above CVE 10,000 or related to products subject to excise duties. Under the regime, it is regarded as a taxpayer the entities that will be listed as large e-commerce players by the government office responsible for the area of finance based on data to be provided by financial institutions.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied at rates ranging from 0% to 50% on the customs value of most imported goods.
Raw materials or capital goods can be imported with an exemption from customs duties or at a low rate.
## Special consumption tax
A special consumption tax is imposed at rates ranging from 10% to 150% on goods that are deemed superfluous, luxurious, or undesirable for economic, social, or environmental policy reasons.
Alcoholic beverages produced locally are exempt from the  component, and the fixed component is set for CVE 20 per litre for beer, CVE 30 per litre for wine, and CVE 100 per litre for spirit drinks.
The State Budget Law for 2025 introduces however several new measures:
  * An increase in the specific tax each pack of cigarettes pays from CVE 120 to CVE 150.
  * Increase in the specific tax on imported alcoholic drinks.
  * Increase in the specific tax on imported sugary drinks.
  * Increase in the specific tax on imports of sweet products.

  * Up to four years: not applicable.
  * More than four and up to six years: 40%.
  * More than six and up to ten years: 80%.
  * More than ten years: 150%.


## Carbon Tax
A carbon tax of CVE 550 (approx. € 5) applies to the issuance of commercial passenger air transport tickets at airports and aerodromes in Cabo Verde, as well as to the docking of passenger ships at Cabo Verde's port terminals.
There are some exceptions to its application, namely for air and maritime transport between the islands of Cabo Verde.
## Property taxes
A property tax, called _Imposto Único sobre o Património_ (IUP), is levied at the rate of 1.5% in Cabo Verde.
IUP is due on the ownership of immovable property on an annual basis by the owner of the real estate, registered as such on 31 December of the relevant year. The taxable basis corresponds to 25% of the value attributed by the Evaluation Commission.
IUP is also due on the transfer (gratuitously or for a consideration) of real estate, based on the value of the contract declared by the transferee.
Exemption of IUP due on the acquisition is granted to:
  * Cabo Verde emigrants who own saving bank accounts.
  * Projects with Touristic Utility Status (_see the section for more information_).


In taxable transfers (not exempt), IUP is payable by the transferee.
IUP is also due on the capital gains arising from the sale of:
  * plots of land for construction if the sales price is more than double the purchase price, and
  * buildings or other real estate if the sale price exceeds the purchase price by more than 30%.


IUP on capital gains is normally paid by the transferor, on the highest of the declared price and the official value of the property concerned.
Capital gains obtained by companies that are in the business of buying real estate for resale are not subject to IUP.
## Stamp duty
Stamp duty is payable on a wide variety of transactions and documents, at rates that may be set in specific amounts or on a percentage basis.
Stamp duty rates:
Item | Stamp duty rate  
---|---  
Loans | 0.5%  
Bank interest and fees/commissions | 3.5%  
Guarantees | 0.5%  
Insurance | 3.5%

Emoluments, registrations acts | 15.0%  
Contracts | CVE 1,000 *

## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are payable by the employee on their gross income at a rate of 8.5% and by the employer at 16%.
## Ecologic charge
Cabo Verde's ecologic charge is applied to packing material, whether empty or full, imported or produced internally, non-biodegradable or made out of metal, glass, or plastic.
The ecologic charge varies from CVE 2 to CVE 100 per item, depending on the quantity or weight of the goods.
This fee is due by the local producer or the importer.
Exemptions are available in the case of packing material used in medicine, essential food (e.g. corn, rice, sugar, flour, and milk), and construction (e.g. cement). Packing material that is exported, reutilised, or recycled is also exempt.
## Tourism tax
A tourism tax is applied to accommodation in the hotel sector. The tax amounts to CVE 276 per person per night for people over 16 years of age and cannot exceed ten consecutive nights.
