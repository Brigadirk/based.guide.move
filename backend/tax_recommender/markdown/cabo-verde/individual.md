## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
Cabo Verdean tax resident individuals are subject to personal income tax (PIT) on a worldwide basis (i.e. resident individuals are subject to tax on all income, regardless of whether it is earned within the Cabo Verdean territory or overseas). While taxpayers have the option to include Category A income in their annual tax return, it is mandatory to declare income from Category B (with organised accounting) and Category C. _See the section for further information._
Non-resident individuals are subject to PIT only on Cabo Verdean-source income at flat tax rates that are the same as those applicable for resident taxpayers.
## Tax methods
Individuals can be taxed under two different tax methods: declarative (self-assessment method) and final withholding method.
### Declarative method
Under the declarative method, individuals are taxed according to their annual income statement. This method is mandatorily applicable to (i) taxpayers taxed under Category B (business and professional income) with standard organised accounting, and (ii) taxpayers taxed under Category C (rental income).
This method is also applicable to dependent workers (Category A) who opt to file the tax return, on the income obtained abroad by resident taxpayers, and on the income obtained in Cabo Verde by non-resident taxpayers that could not be taxed at flat rates.
The total income will be subject to taxation at rates ranging between 16.5% and 27.5%.
### Final withholding method
The final withholding method is applied to collect taxes when taxpayers are not obligated to submit their annual income statement in the following cases: Categories A, D, E, and under the Special Regime for Small and Micro Sized Companies (SRSMC).
Such income is taxable according to the WHT applicable for each category (_see the section_).
## Personal income tax rates
The tax rates applicable in the case of the declarative method and on unjustified net wealth increases are the following:
Taxable income (CVE*) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 960,000 | 16.5  
960,000 | 1,800,000 | 23.1  
1,800,000 | 27.5  
* Cabo Verdean escudos
An exemption from taxation applies to net income of up to CVE 220,000 annually.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Taxable period
As a rule, the tax year coincides with the calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December).
## Tax returns and assessment
The deadline for filing the annual return is 31 March of the following year for taxpayers earning employment and pension income (Category A) who opt to do so (it is not mandatory to file a tax return in this case).
Non-resident individuals do not have the option to file an annual PIT return.
The tax assessment is made by the local tax office.
In the remaining cases in which the declaration-based method is required, taxpayers must compute the tax due and file a tax return by 31 May of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Where WHT is final, there is no further tax liability. Advance WHT is credited against the final tax liability.
Any outstanding tax liability must be paid by 31 August of the year in which the return is due.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 16 February 2025
## Category A: Employment and pension income
Employment income is specifically defined in the PIT Code and covers all payments in connection with work (employment contract), such as salary, bonuses, commissions, pensions, allowances (e.g. cost-of-living and housing allowances), and benefits in kind (e.g. company cars), regardless of where the payment originates.
Managers or board members’ remuneration is taxed as employment income.
The following types of income are exempt from PIT:
  * _Per diems_ for national and international trips, for the portion that does not exceed the limits set for the public services.
  * Lunch allowance, up to CVE 250 per day.
  * Use of personal car, up to CVE 120,000 per year.
  * Cash shortage allowance, up to 15% of the monthly salary.
  * Family allowance, up to CVE 500 per month, for each dependant or equivalent and ancestors.
  * Redundancy payments are taxable on the portion that exceeds one and a half times the average remuneration paid during the last months of employment, multiplied by the number of years of employment.


Pensions are also subject to taxation. Pension income below CVE 960,000 is exempt from PIT.
### Withholding tax (WHT)
Employment and pension income are generally subject to monthly WHT.
As a rule, the monthly WHT is levied as final taxation, unless the taxpayer opts to file the tax return, in which case the tax withheld has the nature of an advance payment on account of the final annual income tax liability.
The monthly tax withholdings due are calculated by applying the following progressive WHT rates and the corresponding deduction to the taxable income:
Bracket | Taxable income (CVE) | WHT rate (%) | Deduction (CVE)  
---|---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
1 | 0 | 80,000 | 15 | 5,500  
2 | 80,000 | 150,000 |  21 | 10,300  
3 | 150,000 | 25 | 16,300  
## Category B: Business and professional income
Business and professional income earned by individual entrepreneurs are taxed under the following regimes:
  * Standard organised accounting.
  * Special Regime for Small and Micro Sized Companies (SRSMC).
  * Single Act (_ato isolado_).


Business and professional income earned by individual entrepreneurs under standard organised accounting are subject to WHT at the rate of 20% as an advance payment on account of the final annual income tax liability.
Net income is computed under the rules applicable to companies with the adjustments provided for in the PIT Code and subject to income tax at the PIT rates applicable.
Net income is computed according to the declaration-based method (_método declarativo_) where tax is levied on the aggregate base of the relevant income categories in the household minus personal deductions and allowances.
Business and professional income earned by individual entrepreneurs under the SRSMC are subject to a flat rate of 4%.
Under this regime, micro and small-sized companies are subject to a Single Special Tax (SST) of 4% levied on the gross amount of sales obtained in each taxable year, to be paid quarterly.
SST replaced the corporate income tax (CIT), fire brigade surtax, and VAT, as well as the contribution to social security due by the company.
Under the PIT Code, it is considered as a Single Act a taxable operation performed twice during the tax year.
## Category C: Rental income
Rental income is subject to WHT at the rate of 20% as an advance payment on account of the final annual income tax liability. To compute the net income, taxpayers may deduct maintenance and repair expenses of up to 30% of gross rental income.
## Category D: Investment income
In general, investment income is subject to a flat rate of 20%; however, some exceptions apply:
  * Dividends are subject to a flat rate of 10%.
  * Interests on bonds are subject to a flat rate of 10%.
  * A special tax regime foreseen in the Tax Benefits Code provides for an exemption from taxation on interest on term deposits received by Cabo Verdean emigrants; income derived from bonds or similar products (except debt securities listed in the securities market) obtained until 31 December 2017 benefits from a 5% flat rate; dividends from shares listed in the stock exchange, placed at the disposal of their holders until 31 December 2017, are exempt from PIT.


## Category E: Capital gains
Capital gains earned by individual taxpayers are subject to a flat rate of 1% in the case of gains on the disposal of immovable property, intellectual property, or shareholdings. A flat rate of 20% applies in the case of gains on gambling, lottery, betting, prizes awarded in sweepstakes, or contests.
