## Tax returns
Taxpayers are required to file a tax return by 31 May of the year following the end of the tax year in case the tax year corresponds to the calendar year (last day of the fifth month following the end of the tax year in case the tax year is different from the tax year).

Taxpayers are required to self-assess the tax due by 31 May of the year following the end of the tax year.
