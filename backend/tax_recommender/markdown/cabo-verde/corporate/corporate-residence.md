A company or entity is deemed to be resident in Cabo Verde if its registered head office or its place of effective management is in the Cabo Verde territory.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Non-resident companies deemed to have a PE in Cabo Verde are also subject to tax in Cabo Verde. Under Cabo Verde tax law, a non-resident company is deemed to have a PE if the non-resident company:
  * has any fixed installation or permanent representation located in Cabo Verde through which, among others, activities of a commercial, industrial, or agricultural nature, or fishing and rendering of services are carried out (including agricultural, fishing, and cattle raising explorations, or other quarries or any other places of natural resources extraction) or
  * carries out its activity in Cabo Verde through: 
    * employees, or any other personnel hired for that purpose, for a period (continuous or not) of not less than 183 days within a 12-month period
    * a person (a dependent agent), which is not an independent agent, acting, in the Cabo Verde territory on behalf of a company, with powers to intermediate and conclude binding contracts for that company, within the scope of its business activity, or
    * a building site or a construction installation if it lasts for more than 183 days, as well as activities of coordination, supervision, and inspection related with the building site or its construction installation.


A PE is also recognised in case of:
  * Commissionaire arrangements.
  * Preparatory or ancillary activities carried out by closely related enterprises through a fixed installation.
  * Independent agents acting exclusively, or almost exclusively, on behalf of one or more closely related enterprises.


A PE of a non-resident is taxed as a resident company.
