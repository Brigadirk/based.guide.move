## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
In general, the Kazakhstan Tax Code allows taxpayers to credit the foreign income taxes paid against the income taxes payable in Kazakhstan, provided the documents confirming the payment of such taxes are available. However, a tax credit may not be granted in certain cases (e.g. for taxes paid in countries with privileged taxation).
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives are available to certain Kazakhstan legal entities that fit certain criteria and possess objects (e.g. certain fixed assets) for which investment incentives may be applied. Generally, the investment incentives allow companies to fully deduct, for CIT purposes, the cost of the investment objects and the cost associated with their reconstruction and modernisation either at once or within the first three years of their use.
Based on the Entrepreneurial Code, incentives are granted under an investment contract between the government and companies with focus on priority sectors of the economy, as determined by the government. A qualifying investment project is granted with (i) exemption from customs duties and import VAT exemptions, with some limitations, and (ii) state in-kind grants. Priority investment projects, alongside the above-mentioned benefits, get (iii) tax incentives and (iv) investment subsidies. Special investment projects in the form of investment preferences are granted with (v) exemption from custom duties and (vi) tax incentives.
The amendments to the Tax Code introduced an 'investment tax credit' that allows changing tax payment deadlines for certain categories of taxpayers and also allows them to reduce tax payments by 100% or pay tax due in instalments, provided certain criteria of the taxpayer is met. The investment tax credit can be provided for a period of up to three years.
From 2022, a stable tax regime for ten years may be provided under a new investment incentive envisaged by the Entrepreneurial Code ('Agreement on investment obligations') in return for certain obligations to be fulfilled by a taxpayer. Guarantee of taxation regime stability is provided for VAT, WHT, payroll tax, excise taxes, and payments for emissions to the environment.
