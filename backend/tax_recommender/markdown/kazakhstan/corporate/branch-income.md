## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Net income of a non-resident legal entity’s PE, after CIT at 20%, is subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 15%, which may be reduced under an applicable double tax treaty (DTT). As such, the effective tax rate for income of a non-resident legal entity’s PE equals 32% if there is no reduction under a DTT.
