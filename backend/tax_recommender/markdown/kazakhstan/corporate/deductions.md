## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Allowable deductions generally include expenses associated with activities designed to generate income, unless specifically restricted for deduction by the tax legislation. All expenses require supporting documentation.
Recognition of expenses is performed in accordance with IFRS and Kazakhstan accounting and financial reporting legislation, unless otherwise stated in new Tax Code. If recognition of expenses as per IFRS differs from the new Tax Code, the latter should prevail.
## Depreciation and depletion
Tax depreciation is calculated using the declining-balance method at depreciation rates ranging from 10% to 40%, applied to the balances of four basic categories of assets:
  * Buildings and facilities (except for oil and gas wells and transmission facilities): 10%.
  * Machinery and equipment (except for machines and equipment for oil and gas production, computers, and equipment for information processing): 25%.
  * Computers and equipment for information processing: 40%.
  * Fixed assets not included in other groups, including oil and gas wells, transmission equipment, oil and gas machinery and equipment: 15%.

There are no special provisions in the Kazakhstan Tax Code with respect to deductibility of goodwill expenses.
In general, assets not subject to amortisation per financial accounting are not regarded as fixed assets and are not subject to deduction.
## Start-up expenses
The Kazakhstan Tax Code does not specifically address deductibility of start-up expenses, but, generally, expenses incurred in relation to business activities and aimed at earning revenue occurring at start-up should be deductible.
## Interest expenses
