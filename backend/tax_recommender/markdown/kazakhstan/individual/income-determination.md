## Equity compensation
No taxable income is recognised at either the grant date or date of exercise for equity compensation, as the difference between the actual cost and fair market value is specifically excluded from taxation.
## Business income
The taxable income of an individual entrepreneur shall be determined in a manner similar to that of corporations (_see_ _in the Corporate tax summary_).
