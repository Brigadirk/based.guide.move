Notes
The following items were not included in the income tax return because they are subject to final tax:
Interest on peso bank account | 20,000  
---|---  
Capital gain on sale of shares | 5,000  
Dividend income | 10,000  
Housing benefit (3) | 300,000  
  1. Philippine social tax contributions, if any, made by the resident alien and/or his wife to the Philippine social security agencies shall be allowed as deductions from gross income in calculating their tax liabilities for the year.
  2. For individuals receiving salary and other allowances from one employer only, the tax due is usually equal to tax withheld since the employer is required to compute and withhold the total tax due on the employee's compensation earned during the year, using the annual graduated income tax table, before paying the last payroll for the year.
  3. As a managerial employee, the housing benefit provided to the husband shall be subject to FBT rather than income tax.


The above individual tax calculation also applies to non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines for their Philippine-source income.
