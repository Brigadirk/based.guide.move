## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Domestic corporations are allowed to claim a credit for any income taxes paid to a foreign country, provided that the taxes are not claimed as deductions. Foreign corporations are not allowed foreign tax credits.
Credits for foreign taxes are determined on a country-by-country basis. The amount of foreign tax credit in respect of the tax paid in a country shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken, which the taxpayer’s income from the country bears to its entire taxable income. There is, however, a further limitation based on the total amount of foreign-sourced income that the taxpayer earns. The total amount of foreign tax credits shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against which the tax credit is taken that the taxpayer’s foreign-sourced income bears to its entire taxable income.
## Incentives
Export-oriented enterprises and domestic market enterprises (DMEs) engaged in strategic activities as defined under the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP) are eligible for various incentives.

There shall be customs duty exemption for importations of capital equipment, raw materials, spare parts, or accessories, and VAT exemption on importation and VAT zero-rating on domestic purchases.
Additional two (2) years ITH shall be granted to projects or activities of registered enterprises located in areas recovering from armed conflict or a major disaster.

The VAT exemption on importation or the VAT zero-rating of local purchases only applies to goods and services directly attributable to the registered project or activity of an REE or of a registered high-value DME including incidental expenses.
Local sales of goods and services by an RBE, regardless of income tax incentives regime and location, shall be subject to the 12% VAT unless otherwise VAT-exempt or VAT zero-rated. The term “local sales” covers sales to DMEs or non-RBEs, regardless of where the sales take place.
Any REE that fails to meet the 70% export sales threshold in the immediately preceding year or any high-value DME that fails to meet the export sale or investment capital requirement shall be disqualified from availing the duty exemption on importation and the VAT zero-rating of local purchases.
### Other available incentives
ITH applies to all RBEs with respect to their registered project or activity. Double registration for purposes of availing of other incentives under special laws is prohibited.
Local government units (LGUs) may impose a local tax on RBEs not to exceed 2% of gross income. This RBE local tax (RBELT) is in lieu of all local taxes and local fees and charges imposed by LGUs. The RBELT shall not apply to RBEs under the SCIT regime.
