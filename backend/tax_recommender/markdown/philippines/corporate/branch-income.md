## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
The income tax rate on branch profits is the same as on corporate profits. In general, profits remitted abroad by a branch office are subject to a 15% tax rate, based on the total profits applied or earmarked for remittance, without any deduction for the tax component thereof. A lower rate may apply under certain tax treaties. Profits from qualified activities remitted by a branch registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) are tax exempt.
