## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 25 February 2025
A domestic corporation is subject to tax on its worldwide income. On the other hand, a foreign corporation is subject to tax only on income from Philippine sources.
## Domestic corporations
The following corporate income tax (CIT) rates apply to domestic corporations:
Income | CIT rate (%)  
---|---  
In general, on net income from all sources. | 25  
On net income from all sources of domestic corporations with total assets not exceeding 100 million Philippine pesos (PHP) and total net taxable income not exceeding PHP 5 million. | 20  
Minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) on gross income, beginning in the fourth taxable year following the year of commencement of business operations. MCIT is imposed where the CIT at 25% is less than 2% MCIT on gross income. | 2  
Proprietary educational institutions and non-profit hospitals, on net income if gross income from unrelated trade, business, and other activities does not exceed 50% of the total gross income from all sources. | 10  
Non-stock, non-profit educational institutions (all assets and revenues used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes) and other non-profit organisations. | Exempt  
Certain passive income from domestic sources is subject to final tax rather than ordinary income tax (_see the section_).
## Resident foreign corporations
Resident foreign corporations (i.e. foreign corporations engaged in trade or business in the Philippines through a branch office) are taxed in the same manner as domestic corporations (except on capital gains on the sale of buildings not used in business, which are taxable as ordinary income), but only on Philippine-source income.
Income | CIT rate (%)  
---|---  
Income of international carriers on their gross Philippine billings | 2.5  
Interest income from foreign currency loans granted by foreign currency deposit units (FCDUs) of depository banks to residents other than offshore business units (OBUs) or other FCDUs of depository banks | 10  
Income of FCDUs of depository banks from foreign currency transactions with non-residents, OBUs or other FCDUs, and local commercial banks (including branches of foreign banks) authorised by the _Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas_ (BSP; central bank) to transact business with FCDUs | Exempt  
Regional or area headquarters of multinational corporations that do not earn or derive income from the Philippines, and that act as supervisory, communications, and coordinating centres for their affiliates, subsidiaries, or branches in the Asia-Pacific region and other foreign markets | Exempt  
## Non-resident foreign corporations
The following corporate tax rates apply to non-resident foreign corporations with respect to gross income derived from sources within the Philippines:
Tax type | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Income tax (in general) | 25  
Reinsurance premiums | Exempt  
Interest on foreign loans | 20  
Dividends from domestic corporations if the country in which the foreign corporation is domiciled does not impose income tax on such dividends, or allows a tax deemed paid credit of 10% (i.e. the difference between the CIT and 15% tax on dividends) | 15  
Rentals and charter fees payable to non-resident owners of vessels chartered by Philippine nationals | 4.5  
Rentals, charters, and other fees derived by non-resident lessors of aircraft, machinery, and other equipment | 7.5
