## Changes to value-added tax (VAT) obligations of overseas suppliers providing goods or services via digital platforms
On 26 March 2024, Instruction 0558/MoF dated 14 February 2024 was published in the Official Gazette, replacing Notification 0541/MoF dated 24 February 2022. The Instruction introduces significant changes, especially concerning the VAT obligations of overseas suppliers providing goods or services via digital platforms in Laos.
An overseas supplier must:
  * Become a VAT registrant in Laos via the online DTax system (or authorise a representative in Laos to do this on its behalf) and collect VAT from sales transactions as of 1 August 2024.
  * Be aware that input VAT can’t be deducted, and VAT refunds are only for commercial reasons (cancellation) and can only be used as a credit for offsetting if the validity period is 183 days.
  * Issue eInvoices for business-to-business (B2B) transactions using its own eInvoice template, and these must include the required information outlined in the Instruction (eInvoices aren’t linked to the Lao government portal and getting them approved isn’t mandatory).
  * Declare and make VAT payments to the Lao tax authorities quarterly.
  * Make VAT payments to the National Treasury’s account, and cards such as Visa debit or credit, Mastercard, JCB, Amex, Union Pay, and wire transfers are accepted.
  * Maintain all VAT-related information for ten years.


The Lao tax authorities are identifying non-registered overseas suppliers as part of effectively implementing this Instruction. Non-compliance with this Instruction may result in a warning, fines, or temporary suspension of digital service channels. Penalties will be decided on a case-by-case basis.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
## Taxable period
PT is determined on a calendar-year basis.
## Tax returns
According to the Lao Tax Law, the annual tax return is due by 20 January (previously 10 January) of the subsequent year, and the filing of the financial statements is due by 31 March of the following year. Submission of the financial statements will generally be followed by an audit by the Tax Department.
## Payment of tax
PT is payable twice a year in advance, with a final payment (if any) after the tax assessment. The first two payments must be paid by 20 July of the current tax year and 20 January of the subsequent year. The final payment (if any) is due 15 working days after the tax assessment. The first two payments are either based on the actual or prior year's PT (or expected tax for the current year). Any excess PT payment can be carried forward to the subsequent year.
### Penalties
Some of the penalties are as follows:
  * Late filing and payment of taxes: Fine of 0.1% per day of delay based on the tax payable.
  * Under reporting of income or underpayment of taxes:
    * First offence: Fine at 30% of the tax payable.
    * Second offence: Fine at 60% of the tax payable.
    * Third offence: Fine at 100% of tax payable, permanent closure of business, and publication of the offence.


## Tax audit process
In practice, the tax authorities will audit the company after the annual tax filing and issue a tax payment certificate to the company after they complete their audit process. Most large companies (i.e. assets of more than LAK 5 billion) are audited.
## Statute of limitations
Generally, the tax department has the right to audit within three accounting years.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
There are no areas of special focus in tax examinations in Lao PDR.


# Lao PDR
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
There is no definition of residence or permanent establishment (PE) provided in the Lao Tax Law, as well as the Value Added Tax Law (VAT Law).
According to the double tax treaties (DTTs) of Lao PDR, ‘permanent establishment’ generally means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.
It is understood that the reason for having no PE definition in the law is because there is foreign withholding tax (FWHT) levied on foreign entities conducting their business activities in Lao PDR. _For more information about the FWHT, please see the_ _section_.
Currently, the government is reassessing tax privileges and DTTs that they have offered to some businesses/signed with some countries in the past, and they have planned to cancel some; however, this is not yet final.


# Lao PDR
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025

## Depreciation
Depreciation rates prescribed under the Lao Tax Law may differ from financial accounting. Depreciation shall commence from acquisition date. Depreciation may be calculated on the cost of a business asset by straight-line, double-declining, or activity-based methods over the prescribed useful lives, as follows:
Assets | Years

Ships, cruises, ferries, and other similar boats | 10  
Office equipment | 5

## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses can be amortised over a two-year period.
## Interest expenses
Interest that is not capital in nature is generally deductible, subject to certain conditions.
## Provisions
Provisions for expenses not yet incurred and reserves (e.g. bad debts) are not tax-deductible. A deduction for bad debts is allowed if a certain procedure has been followed.
Provisions entered by banks or other financial institutions based on the accounting standards and requirements of Bank of Lao PDR can be claimed as tax deductions.

## Taxes
Taxes levied on income and VAT on fixed assets used in the business are not deductible for PT purposes.
## Net operating and capital losses
Tax losses accepted by the authority may be carried forward for five years (previously three years) but need independently audited financial statements. A change in control will not impact a company's loss carryforward. Capital losses are treated as ordinary losses.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Subject to the normal and specific rules on deductibility, a deduction may be claimed for payments to foreign affiliates.

## Customs duty and other tax incentives
In addition to the incentives in relation to PT, the above investors shall also be entitled to the following customs duty and other tax incentives:

Dividends | Interest | Royalties  
Brunei | 5/10 (1) | 10 | 10  
China | 5 | 5 | 5  
Indonesia | 10 | 10 | 10

  2. 5% if the company directly holds at least 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividend; 15% in all other cases.

  4. 10% if received by financial institutions (including insurance companies); 15% in all other cases.


## Foreign withholding tax (FWHT)
An FWHT applies where a registered entity in Lao PDR contracts with a foreign supplier of goods and services not registered in Lao PDR regardless of whether the services are provided in Lao PDR or outside Lao PDR. The FWHT comprises both a PT and VAT (on services only) element and is the final tax on the foreign supplier. The FWHT withholding and filing obligation rests with the Lao PDR customer, and it is applied before payment to the foreign supplier.
For foreign suppliers, PT must be withheld at a deemed percentage of taxable turnover. The deemed rates are determined according to the nature of the contract or activity.
Activity | Deemed profit margin (% of business revenue) | Deemed PT rate (%)  
---|---|---  
Agricultural manufacturing and handicraft production | 7 | 1.4  
Industrial production and other processing industries | 10 | 2  
Commerce and services | 15 | 3  
These PT rates are then added to the VAT at 10% (if applicable) to determine the total FWHT. For example, a professional fee of LAK 100,000 would result in a total FWHT of LAK 13,000 (i.e. withholding PT of LAK 3,000 and withholding VAT of LAK 10,000).


# Lao PDR
## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
The PT calculation is based on an entity's actual accounting profits, prepared in accordance with the Lao Accounting Manual, and adjusted for tax purposes. The Lao PDR tax regulations are silent on the treatment of many items. Generally, in such cases, the tax treatment will follow the accounting treatment. Some of the more common differences are depreciation, entertainment expenses, and the non-deductibility of certain reserves and provisions (until actually paid).
## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation for tax purposes follows the method used for accounting purposes in Lao PDR. All allowances are non-deductible expenses.
## Capital gains
There is no separate tax on capital gains in Lao PDR. However, profits from the sale of shares are subject to tax at the rate of 2% of the selling price.
There is no tax on the gain on sale of shares listed in the LSX.
The buyer of shares, except shares listed in the LSX, is required to withhold and remit the tax.
The rate of income tax on sales or transfers of real property are as follows:
  * In case of land for agriculture purposes: 1% of the selling price.
  * In other cases: 2% of the selling price.


## Dividend income
Dividends (including share in partnership income) received are taxed at a flat rate of 10%. Dividends distributed by companies listed in the LSX are exempt from tax.
## Interest income
Interest income (except exempt interest income) shall be appropriately subject to income tax of 10%. Exempt interest income includes:
  * Interest income derived from money deposited with the commercial banks.
  * Interest income from government bonds or debentures.


## Rental/royalty income
Rental and royalty income are appropriately subject to income tax at the flat rate of 10% and 5%, respectively.
## Unrealised exchange gains/losses
Unrealised exchange gains are not taxable, and losses are not deductible.
## Foreign income
Companies registered under Lao PDR laws are taxed on their worldwide income. Foreign income derived from a treaty country is taxed according to the applicable DTT.

## Profit tax (PT)
All companies (including all forms of legal entities, like partnerships) that are registered under Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) law are subject to PT on their worldwide income. Companies formed under foreign law, operating a business in Lao PDR, and conducting business in Lao PDR are subject to tax on their income derived in Lao PDR.
The standard rate of PT for companies in Lao PDR is as follows, calculated on net profit after adjustments for non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses, and others in accordance with the Lao Income Tax Law:
Types of companies | PT rate (%)  
---|---  
Companies listed in the Lao Securities Exchange (LSX): For the first four years from registration | 13 (previously 19)  
Companies that produce, import, and distribute tobacco products (2% to be contributed to the Tobacco Control Fund) | 22 (previously 26)  
Companies in the mineral industry with concession agreement | 35  
Training and research centres | 5  
Companies using green technology | 7  
All other companies, both domestic and foreign | 20 (previously 24)  
Tax holidays and reduced PT rates are applicable to companies whose investment activities qualify as promoted investment activities (_see the_ _section for more information_) or who have large investments in mining and hydro power project (tax incentive is dependent on negotiations).
## Lump-sum tax
The lump-sum tax is imposed on companies with small and medium businesses (400 million Lao kip [LAK] or less) that do not maintain Lao accounting books and derive income that is not subject to income tax pursuant to the Lao Tax Law. The lump-sum tax is paid in lieu of the PT, based on an agreement with the tax office; consequently, the lump-sum tax is regarded as a tax within the PT category. The lump-sum tax rates are as follows:
Annual turnover (LAK) | Lump-sum tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Manufacturing, agriculture, and other processing industries | Commerce | Services  
50 million or less (previously less than 12 million) | 0 | 0 | 0  
More than 50 million to 400 million | 1 (previously 3 to 5) | 2 (previously 4 to 6) | 3 (previously 5 to 7)  
## Local income taxes 
There are no provincial or local income taxes in Lao PDR.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT of 10% generally applies on the following activities:
  * Importation of goods and services.
  * Supply of goods and services in Lao PDR by companies registered and operating a business in the VAT system.
  * Export of services by companies registered and operating a business in the VAT system.


The supply and importation of certain goods and services are exempt from VAT, including unprocessed agricultural products, seeds, fertilisers, equipment for agricultural purposes, international transportation services, educational goods and services, certain medical goods and services, certain bank services, and financial institution services.
Exports of goods are zero-rated, except the export of natural resources that are not finished goods, which are subject to 10% VAT.
The conventional credit method is used to calculate the VAT payable (i.e. output VAT less allowable input VAT). Input VAT can be claimed within three months from the date incurred. Input VAT incurred in relation to the supply of goods for exports may be refundable.
There is no concept of export services in the VAT Law. It appears that all services from all sources are subject to the standard VAT of 10%.
Companies who register an enterprise and obtain their taxpayer identification number (TIN) and/or get investment approval from the relevant authorities shall automatically be registered in the VAT system, except for the micro enterprises.
One unique feature of the Lao PDR VAT is that VAT is imposed on the services rendered by overseas service providers to domestic service users. Domestic service users have an obligation to withhold VAT on the service fees paid to overseas service providers and pay the VAT to the tax authority. The rate of withholding VAT is 10%.
If a company has transactions with a supplier that is not registered in the VAT system or doesn't receive the VAT certificate from the supplier (both corporate and individual), the company should contact the tax authority to make the VAT payment VAT. Such VAT can be utilised as input VAT.
On 26 March 2024, Instruction 0558/MoF dated 14 February 2024 was published in the Official Gazette, replacing Notification 0541/MoF dated 24 February 2022. The Instruction introduces significant changes, especially concerning the VAT obligations of overseas suppliers providing goods or services via digital platforms in Laos.
An overseas supplier must:
  * Become a VAT registrant in Laos via the online DTax system (or authorise a representative in Laos to do this on its behalf) and collect VAT from sales transactions as of 1 August 2024.
  * Be aware that input VAT can’t be deducted, and VAT refunds are only for commercial reasons (cancellation) and can only be used as a credit for offsetting if the validity period is 183 days.
  * Issue eInvoices for B2B transactions using its own eInvoice template, and these must include the required information outlined in the Instruction (eInvoices aren’t linked to the Lao government portal and getting them approved isn’t mandatory).
  * Declare and make VAT payments to the Lao tax authorities quarterly.
  * Make VAT payments to the National Treasury’s account, and cards such as Visa debit or credit, Mastercard, JCB, Amex, Union Pay, and wire transfers are accepted.
  * Maintain all VAT-related information for ten years.


The Lao tax authorities are identifying non-registered overseas suppliers as part of effectively implementing this Instruction. Non-compliance with this Instruction may result in a warning, fines, or temporary suspension of digital service channels. Penalties will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
## Import duties
All goods imported into Lao PDR are subject to import duty. Exemptions are available to enterprises operating promoted investment activities (_see the_ _section for more information_).
Lao PDR has adopted the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) valuation principles.
Duty rates are based on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) harmonised tariff nomenclature for imports from ASEAN member countries (ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement [ATIGA]).
Lao PDR has also signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with ASEAN dialogue countries: Australia and New Zealand (under their Closer Economic Relations FTA), China, India, Japan, and Korea; otherwise, normal rates are applied. Duty rates range between 0% and 40%, depending on whether the goods are from an ASEAN country or another country.
## Excise taxes
Excise tax is levied on consumers of certain imported goods, domestic produced goods, and services within the territory of Lao PDR. The rates range from 5% to 100%. Importers file and pay excise tax at the time of filing the customs declarations at the customs checkpoints. Domestic producers and service suppliers shall file their monthly excise tax returns no later than the 20th (previously 15th) day of the following month.
## Property taxes
The land tax is based on both the location and the size of the land and is levied at annual rates per square metre.
## Transfer taxes
There are no transfer taxes in Lao PDR.
## Stamp taxes
The stamp taxes in Lao PDR range from LAK 2,000 to LAK 20,000, depending on the types of documents.
## Payroll taxes
Income from salaries and wages, including allowances, over-time pay, bonuses, meeting allowances for members of the executive board of the companies, and other benefits received in cash and in kind, is subject to income tax withholding by employers at the progressive rates ranging from 0% to 25% (previously 24%). Personal income tax (PIT) is calculated based on gross revenue, on a monthly basis, and is recalculated again on an annual basis.
## Social Security Scheme contributions
The government is encouraging all enterprises to register themselves and their employees in the Social Security Scheme and make contributions to the scheme. Both the enterprise and its employees are obligated to contribute to the Social Security Scheme a combined 11.5% of the employees’ basic salaries or wages. The enterprise contributes 6%, and each employee contributes 5.5%.
According to Notification No. 0824/NSSFO issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the basic amount for Social Security Scheme calculation is LAK 4.5 million.
The Social Security Scheme contribution shall be paid by the 20th (previously 15th) day of the following month.
## Environmental tax
Under the Lao Tax Law, environmental tax is imposed on companies operating a business involving certain prescribed activities that are considered to cause pollution; damage the health and lives of any human, animal, or plant; or disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. The taxable amount and tax rate depend on the business activity.
## Fees and administrative charges
Under the Lao Tax Law, government sectors can collect fees for issuing fiscal licences, business licences, permits, visas, advertisement boards, broadcasting rights, and other services. The charges and service fees are set periodically by Presidential Decree.
