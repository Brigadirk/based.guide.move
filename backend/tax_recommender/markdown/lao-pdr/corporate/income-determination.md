## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
The PT calculation is based on an entity's actual accounting profits, prepared in accordance with the Lao Accounting Manual, and adjusted for tax purposes. The Lao PDR tax regulations are silent on the treatment of many items. Generally, in such cases, the tax treatment will follow the accounting treatment. Some of the more common differences are depreciation, entertainment expenses, and the non-deductibility of certain reserves and provisions (until actually paid).
## Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation for tax purposes follows the method used for accounting purposes in Lao PDR. All allowances are non-deductible expenses.
