## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Group taxation is not permitted, and each entity must file its own separate tax return.
## Transfer pricing
There are no specific transfer pricing rules. However, the tax authority has the right to assess the transaction if they determine it is not at the market price or reasonable. There is no guideline of the market rate or reasonable price issued from the authority.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no specific thin capitalisation rules in the Lao Tax Law. However, the Law on Investment Promotion No 14/NA (Investment Law), dated 17 November 2016, provides that the registered capital of companies availing of the incentives shall not be less than 30% of the total capital.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no CFC or similar regime in Lao PDR.
