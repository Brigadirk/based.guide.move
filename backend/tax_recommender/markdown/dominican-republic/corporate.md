Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
A company is considered resident when it is registered or incorporated under the laws of the Dominican Republic. Foreign entities are considered as domiciled when they are registered in the Dominican Republic as a branch or PE, and they are subject to local tax in the same manner.

  * An address in the Dominican Republic.
  * Office.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation allowances on fixed assets are determined by the declining-balance method at the following rates:
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Buildings | 5  
Office furniture, fixtures, computers, light vehicles, etc. | 25  
Other assets not specified | 15  
The fiscal book value is adjusted by the annual inflation rate.
Amortisation of intangible assets (e.g. patents, author's rights, drawings, franchises, contracts without set expiration dates) is deductible as long as the amortisation of the fiscal cost of each intangible good, including patents, copyrights, drawings, models, contracts, and franchises whose life has a defined limit, should reflect the life of said good and the straight-line recovery method.
## Goodwill
_See amortisation of intangible assets in the description of Depreciation and amortisation above_.
## Start-up expenses
The Dominican tax legislation does not establish specific provisions regarding the deduction of start-up expenses. The general deductions rule is the accrual method.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible, provided they are associated with the acquisition, maintenance, and/or exploitation of taxable income generating assets.
The interest expense deduction is limited when the beneficiary is a non-resident located in a tax haven or in a low-taxation jurisdiction, or when the interest is not otherwise subject to tax by the recipient. Thin capitalisation rules may also limit the deduction (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
## Bad debt
Bad debts are deductible only in the year the loss is suffered. Authorisation may be obtained to use an alternative method, which consists of creating a provision allowing the deduction only in the year the bad debts qualify as doubtful, up to 4% of the balance of the accounts receivable at year-end.
## Charitable contributions
Donations made are tax deductible in the Dominican Republic, up to 5% of the taxable income and if the beneficiaries are registered charitable contributions.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are considered non-deductible expenses.
## Taxes
Income taxes are not deductible. Other taxes can be deductible; however, interest and surcharges imposed on taxes are not deductible in general.
## Other significant items
For tax purposes, the following significant items should be considered:
  * Changes in methods are not allowed without prior approval.
  * Bonuses paid to employees within 120 days after the end of the taxable year are deductible for the year just ended.


## Net operating losses
The carryforward of losses of legal entities can be used to offset profits up to the fifth year following the year in which the losses were generated, with a maximum amortisation of 20% in each year. For the fourth year, the deduction allowed should not exceed 80% of the net taxable income. In the fifth year, the percentage is 70%.
There is no carryback loss mechanism in the Dominican Republic.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates for royalties, interest, or service fees are deductible, provided that the 27% WHT was paid (10% on interest).

## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
Group taxation is not permitted in the Dominican Republic.
## Transfer pricing
Per the Dominican Tax Code (DTC), related-party transactions carried out between Dominican companies, regardless of whether the companies are foreign-owned or not, or with companies located in areas of low or no taxation, must be carried out in accordance with the prices agreed in the transfer of goods or services between independent parties.
These provisions shall also apply to transactions carried out by Dominican companies with related companies located in the country that is benefiting from a favourable tax regime.
The tax authorities, following the procedures in the current tax laws in the exercise of its powers of determination, verification, or investigation, may challenge the values declared by taxpayers if such values:
  * do not correspond to the economic reality of the operation involved, or
  * differ substantially from independent companies under similar conditions.


Persons are considered related parties or related persons or entities, resident or not in the Dominican Republic, when among them there is a financial dependency or capital of both is mostly owned by one of them, following (but not limited to) these criteria:
  * One party participates, directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of the other.
  * The same natural persons, companies, or firms participate, directly or indirectly, in the management, control, or capital of such parties.
  * An individual, company, or companies have the ability to influence the business decisions of the company.
  * When participation is defined in terms of the share capital or control of voting rights, a direct or indirect participation of at least 25% will be necessary in either case.


Regarding the advance pricing agreement (APA) regime, an APA may be requested from the tax authorities that sets the values of the transactions carried out between related parties if made prior to completion. Please note the following:
  * The APA may be approved, denied, or modified by the tax authorities with customer acceptance and is valid within 36 months after approval.
  * Subsequent agreements may be valid for up to 36 months; in cases in which it has expired and no new agreement exists, the existing agreement shall continue in effect until it is approved before a new APA.
  * The tax authorities may challenge the taxpayers’ declared values included within the APA when they do not correspond with the criteria agreed in the APA and apply the penalties established in the DTC.
  * For economic sectors, whose business has particular ties or high linkage between the parties, the tax authorities may determine a minimum price or profit margin. Once such price or margin is set, according to the sector, the companies covered by the scheme will act as independent companies. The price or minimum tax profit margin of the taxpayer may be calculated taking into account the total income, the assets used in the business operations during the fiscal year, the total amount of costs and expenses, and/or other sector variables.


Finally, taxpayers must file an annual Informative Tax Return of transactions between related parties, which shall contain detailed information of each transaction, the related party's identification, transfer pricing method, etc.
## Thin capitalisation
According to the thin capitalisation rule, the maximum debt-to-equity ratio allowed to taxpayers is 3:1; over this threshold, the deduction of interest expense is limited.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The Dominican Republic does not have provisions for CFCs.

## Tourism incentives
Law 158-01 on the Promotion of Tourist Development for New or Low Development Locations in Provinces and Areas with Great Tourist Potential, and for the Creation of the Tourist Promotion Official Fund, enacted on 9 October 2001, establishes special incentives and benefits to individuals or companies, residing in the Dominican Republic, that promote or invest capital in any tourist activity described in said Law.

Additionally, the credit on investment expense granted to self-power producers is 40%.
## Industrial renovation and modernisation incentives
The main objective of Law 392-07 about competitive development and local industrial manufacture is to promote policies and support programs for industrial renovation and innovation in order to diversify local production, create industrial parks, and link the country to international markets. Main benefits include VAT exemption on import of machinery and materials, priority on imports granted at customs, and accelerated depreciation.
## Industrial FTZ operations
Law 8-90 about Export FTZs was created to promote employment, production, and economic growth. Entities that would like to benefit from said Law shall be engaged in manufacture/service within a confined space (FTZ park). Special FTZ classification entities, which are entities located outside an FTZ park (e.g. call centres), were abolished with Law No. 253-12. In addition to this, Law 253-12 taxed dividends paid by FTZ entities.
## Border development incentives
Law No. 28-01, dated 1 February 2001, creates a special development frontier zone for industrial, agro-industrial, agriculture/livestock, metalmechanic, FTZ, tourism, metallurgical, and energy companies that exist at the time of promulgation of said law, and those that may be installed in the future within the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Main incentives include 100% exemption on CIT and VAT, as well as customs duties.
## Foreign tax credit
Taxes paid abroad on foreign income taxed in the Dominican Republic may be credited up to the amount of the Dominican tax liability generated by such income. The credits should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## WHT on dividends
Dividends paid in cash to resident and non-resident individuals or corporations are subject to a WHT of 10%.
## WHT on transfers of shares
There is a 1% WHT on the value of the transfer of shares received by the seller in regard to transactions between local entities. Even though transactions between foreign entities are not subject to the 1% WHT, they are subject to capital gain tax.
Such WHT is a payment on account against capital gain tax, payable by the seller through the Form IR-2 (legal entities) or Form IR-1 (individuals), as applicable. However, if they can substantiate that the transaction will not generate a capital gain or that the 1% WHT would generate a capital loss, they may request of the tax authorities, no later than 30 days prior to withholding filing/payment's due date, to be exempt from this obligation.
This 1% WHT should be filed and paid to the tax authorities through the monthly WHT return (IR-17 Form) within the first ten days of the month following the payment to the seller. In case the purchaser is an individual, the 1% WHT is not applicable.
## WHT on interest payments
Financial institutions are appointed as 1% WHT agents on the value paid or credited on account for interest payments of any nature to legal entities.
The interests paid by financial institutions will constitute a deductible expense for tax purposes, provided the WHT was made.
In addition, this rule obligates financial institutions to provide a monthly electronic file, directly to the tax authorities or through the Banks Superintendency, containing all the information related to the interest payment, including the date, value, and identity of the beneficiary.
## WHT on payments to foreign corporations
The WHT on payments to foreign corporations, which are not permanently established in the Dominican Republic, are as follows:
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends and interest | Royalties | Technical assistance | Other services  
Non-treaty | 10 | 27 | 27 | 27  
Treaty:  
Canada | 0/10 (1) | 18 | 27 | 27  
Spain | 0/10 (2) | Up to 10 | N/A | Up to 10  
Notes
  1. 0% or 10% depending on the type of ownership since the Canada-Dominican Republic Treaty contains the more beneficiary treaty clause.
  2. 0% or 10% depending on if the Spanish parent company has more than 75% participation in the Dominican subsidiary. Branches are not subject to profit remittance tax.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
The Dominican Republic follows a territorial concept (i.e. resident companies, branches, and permanent establishments [PEs] are generally subject to taxation on Dominican-source income only); consequently, the tax treatment for corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies is similar in most aspects.
The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 27%.
In addition, the 1% rate assets tax is considered an alternative minimal income tax, payable when the CIT is lower than the assets tax.
Dividends/profits remitted abroad or paid locally are subject to a withholding tax (WHT) of 10% as a definitive tax payment. Free trade zone (FTZ) entities should also make the 10% withholding on profit remittance (in case of branches) or dividend distribution (subsidiaries).
## Local income taxes
In the Dominican Republic, provincial and local government income taxes do not apply.

## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
Tax on the Transfer of Industrialised Goods and Services (ITBIS) is a VAT applied to industrialised goods (movable) and services at a rate of 18%, with exemptions established by law to certain goods and services.
Exempt goods include a wide variety of goods, among which are basic products (eggs, milk, grains, live animals, frozen meats), seeds for planting, fruits and vegetables, medicine, insecticide and pesticides, books/magazines, educational material, wheelchairs, and prosthesis.
Exempt services include educational, health, financial (including insurance), pensions, ground transportation of people and cargo, electricity, water and waste pick-up, housing rental and personal care, and exported services.
A 0% rate applies to exports, including sales to FTZs.
## Tax on gross sales made by FTZs to local market
A 3.5% tax was created on the gross sales of goods and services made by companies in Dominican FTZs to individuals and legal entities in the local market.
## Customs duties
Customs duties are assessed at various rates depending on the nature of the goods and their country of origin. Free trade agreements exist (e.g. the Central America-Dominican Republic-US Free Trade Agreement [DR-CAFTA]) that decrease the customs duty rates for goods imported from the member countries.
## Selective consumption taxes (_Impuesto Selectivo al Consumo_ or ISCs)
ISC is applied to the acquisition or import of certain goods and services.
There are ISCs that vary based on the product, which range from:
  * 10% on the transfer of alcoholic beverages, applied on the retail price. Imports and transfers made by local manufacturers are accountable for this tax.
  * 50% on the transfer of 20 units of tobacco products and 25% on the transfer of 10 units of tobacco products, applied on the retail price. Imports and transfers by local manufacturers are accountable for this tax.
  * 10% on telecommunications services.

  * 0.0015% on the value of checks or wire transfers made through financial entities (this tax does not apply to cash withdrawals or credit card use).


## Real Property Transfer Tax
The Real Property Transfer Tax is assessed at a basic rate of 3% on any transfer of ownership of real estate.

In addition, a 0.5% contribution shall be paid to INFOTEP, and the employer shall withhold said 0.5% contribution from employees’ bonus (not salary).
Employers must share 10% of their net profits with their employees.
