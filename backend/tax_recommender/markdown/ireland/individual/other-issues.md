## Exchange control
Ireland does not impose restrictions on movement of funds into Ireland or from Ireland to other countries. Foreign currency bank accounts may also be held in Ireland and abroad. If a new foreign bank account is opened after arrival in Ireland, it must be reported on your tax return.
## Clearance to work in Ireland
Generally, non-EEA nationals require work clearance, and in certain cases an entry visa, to come and work in Ireland, but EEA nationals do not require either an employment permit or visa to come and work in Ireland.
