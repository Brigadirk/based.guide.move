## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Irish income tax is imposed on the worldwide income of an individual who is resident and domiciled in Ireland.
An individual who is resident but not domiciled in Ireland is liable to Irish income tax on Irish-source income, foreign-employment income earned while carrying out duties in Ireland, and on other foreign income to the extent that it is remitted into Ireland.
A non-resident individual is generally liable to Irish income tax on Irish-source income only.
