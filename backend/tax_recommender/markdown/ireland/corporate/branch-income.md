Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Irish branches of foreign companies are liable to corporation tax at the rates that apply to Irish resident companies. No tax is withheld on repatriation of branch profits to the head office.
These branches are also subject to the general transfer pricing regulations, as well as specific transfer pricing documentation requirements (_see Transfer pricing in the section for further details_).
