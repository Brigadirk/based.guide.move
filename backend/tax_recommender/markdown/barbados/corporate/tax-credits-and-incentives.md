Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
## Foreign tax credit
Barbados allows a credit for foreign taxes (taxes paid in jurisdictions outside Barbados). However, the credit claimed cannot reduce the total tax payable by the person on that income to less than 1%.
## Employment tax credit
Where a person carries on business in an income year and during that income year or any of the following two consecutive income years:
  * there is an increase in profits directly attributable to the business
  * there is an increase in the number of employees who are employed directly in the operations of the business by an amount of at least 10% of the total workforce employed during the previous year, and
  * the increase in the number of employees referred to is maintained for a period of three years,


that person is entitled to a tax credit of 10% of the actual amount of the expenditure incurred in respect of wages for the increase in employees.
The credit is applied in the year in which persons meet the above-mentioned criteria. Any unused credit can be carried forward for three years from the end of the income year in which the credit was obtained, and no cash refund shall be allowed.
## Jobs credits 
A jobs credit may be claimed by a company or PE carrying on business in specified sectors and incurring eligible payroll expenditure after 1 January 2024. The jobs credit will be determined as follows:
  * A credit equal to 25% of eligible payroll expenditure for up to 50 employees.
  * A credit equal to 50% of eligible payroll expenditure for between 51 to 100 employees.
  * A credit equal to 75% of eligible payroll expenditure for between 101 to 150 employees.
  * A credit equal to 100% of eligible payroll expenditure for more than 151 employees.


A claim for a jobs credit must correlate to the income year in which the eligible payroll expenditure was incurred. These credits may be set-off against any other tax liability for a period of four years.
## Patent box regime
Barbados has introduced a new patent box regime whereby, on election, income derived from qualifying intellectual property (IP) may be subject to tax at a rate of 4.5%. The categories of IP that qualify under the regime include rights to software copyright, rights to patents, and other similar legally protected rights.
## Productivity and innovation tax credit
Entities incurring expenditure that is innovative in nature and leading to the development of a new manufacturing process, product, service, or organisational procedure will be granted a tax credit of 25% of the amount expended in that income year. The credit will only be granted if the innovation was successfully introduced to the market as evidenced by increases in sales, productivity, or organisational efficiency.
Any unused tax credit shall be carried forward for a maximum of three years from the end of the income year in which the credit was obtained, but no cash refund will be allowed. Certification from the Executive Director of the National Productivity Council is required.
