## Foreign tax relief
A deduction for the avoidance of double taxation is allowed for foreign-source income and capital gains taxed by Spanish PIT, calculated as the lesser of:
  * The actual foreign tax paid on the foreign-source income, by reason of a tax identical or analogous in its nature to Spanish PIT or NRIT.
  * The result of applying the average effective PIT rate to the foreign-source income taxed abroad.


Any foreign tax withheld (or paid) may be eligible for this deduction; however, if a DTT is applicable, its terms should be taken into account when determining the method to calculate the deduction and making the calculation.
