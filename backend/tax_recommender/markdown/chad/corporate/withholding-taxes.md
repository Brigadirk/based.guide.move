### WHT benefits on payments made to CEMAC residents
To avoid double taxation of incomes of CEMAC origin, the provisions of the Convention provide a principle of exclusive taxation in one country.
Regarding revenues of services, they will be taxed only in the country of location of the beneficiary of incomes (i.e. no WHT in the country of payment of incomes).
Regarding incomes from securities (dividends, interest on deposits, interest on bonds, etc.), they will be taxed only in the country of distribution (i.e. no WHT in the country of payment of incomes).
