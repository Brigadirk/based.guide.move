## Research and development (R&D) incentives

### Tax benefits under the Revenue Code
The Revenue Code provides for an additional 100% deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in Thailand on R&D for technology and innovation (including product and process innovation) when hiring government agencies or the private sector, as approved by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.
## Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC)
Under the Eastern Economic Corridor Act (2018) (EEC Act), an EEC project must be located in certain zones within the EEC, which consists of the three Eastern provinces of Rayong, Chonburi, and Chachoengsao. An EEC project will be promoted only if it is engaged in a target industry.
An EEC-promoted company will be granted CIT exemption and/or reduction privileges according to the criteria prescribed by the EEC committee. Currently, the CIT privileges under the EEC Act have not been announced.
Nevertheless, the BOI, under the Investment Promotion Act, has already issued criteria and incentives for promoted activities located in the EEC. The tax incentives are categorised under three zones, as follows:
  * Special industry promotion zone: 
    * Eastern Airport City (EECa).
    * Eastern Economic Corridor of Innovation (EECi).
    * Digital Park Thailand (EECd).
    * Medical Hub Thammasat University (Pattaya) (EECmd).
    * Genomics Thailand (EECg).
    * Tech Park Ban Chang (EECtp).
  * Industrial estate or industrial area within the EEC.


Only eligible activities under categories A1+-A4 (except for those specified in a negative list) and enabling services can be applied for.
Tax incentives* provided by the BOI are as follows:
  * BOI standard incentives.
  * Additional CIT exemption up to two years.
  * CIT reduction of 50% for up to three years after the end of the tax holiday.


* Subject to qualified human resources, the development of R&D activities, and the location of the project.
Note that EEC incentives cannot be utilised together with those under the merit of industrial area development.
The EEC Act also grants a PIT reduction for employees with special knowledge/abilities who work or operate a business in certain zones within the EEC.
Qualified expatriates and Thai employees are granted a flat rate of 17% PIT on their income derived from working for companies carrying on target activities within the EEC.
## International business centre (IBC)
An international business centre (IBC) regime has been launched to replace the previous regional operating headquarters (ROH), international headquarters (IHQ), and international trade centre (ITC) regimes.
The criteria for the establishment and operation of an IBC are as follows:
  * A Thai company incorporated for the purpose of providing management, technical, support, or treasury management services to its associated enterprises or for undertaking the ITC business.
  * Paid-up capital on the last day of each accounting period of at least THB 10 million.
  * Management, technical, support, or treasury management services are provided to its associated enterprises.
  * At least ten knowledgeable and skilled personnel working full time for the IBC or at least five if the IBC acts only as a treasury centre.
  * Expenses for the operation of the IBC paid to recipients in Thailand must be not less than THB 60 million in each accounting period.
  * Other rules, procedures, and conditions that will be prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


Management, technical, and support services comprise the following:
  * General management, business planning, and business coordination.
  * Procurement of raw materials and parts.
  * Research and development of products.
  * Technical support.
  * Marketing and sales promotion.
  * Personnel management and training.
  * Financial advice.
  * Economic and investment analysis and research.
  * Credit control and management.
  * Other support services as prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


Treasury management services comprise the following:
  * Treasury management of a treasury centre as permitted under the exchange control law.
  * Borrowing and lending in baht of a treasury centre as permitted under the exchange control law.


ITC means the international business of buying and selling goods, which may include the provision of services related to the goods purchased and sold. These services include the following:
  * Procurement of goods.
  * Storage of goods while awaiting delivery.
  * Packing and packaging.
  * Transportation of goods.
  * Insurance of goods.
  * Technical advice and services and product training.
  * The other services as prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


Income of the IBC means the following:
  * Income from the provision of management, technical, support, or treasury management services to its associated enterprises.
  * Royalties from associated enterprises arising from a result of R&D carried out in Thailand by the IBC or other entities hired by the IBC, according to the rules, procedures, and conditions prescribed by the Director-General of the Revenue Department.


The following tax benefits are available for 15 accounting periods: 
  * Reduced rates of CIT on qualifying income: 
    * 8% if the IBC has incurred expenditure of at least THB 60 million paid to recipients in Thailand during the accounting period.
    * 5% if the IBC has incurred expenditure of at least THB 300 million paid to recipients in Thailand during the accounting period.
    * 3% if the IBC has incurred expenditure of at least THB 600 million paid to recipients in Thailand during the accounting period.
  * Exemption from tax on dividends derived by the IBC from its affiliates.
  * Exemption from WHT on dividends paid by the IBC to a non-resident company out of profits derived from qualified service income subject to the reduced rate of tax.
  * Exemption from WHT on interest paid by a treasury centre on borrowed funds that are re-lent to affiliates.
  * Exemption from specific business tax on income received by a treasury centre.
  * PIT rate of 15% for expatriate full time employees of the IBC and working for IBC or ITC businesses. If the company undertakes IBC or ITC business as well as other businesses, the revenue derived from the IBC or ITC or both these businesses must not be less than 70% of the company’s total revenue.


In comparison with the previous ROH/IHQ regimes, the IBC regime does not apply different tax rates to offshore and onshore income. As a consequence, there is no longer any requirement for services to be provided to a minimum number of offshore affiliates. There is also no limit to the amount of onshore income that qualifies for the reduced tax rates. The expenditure required to qualify for the reduced tax rates has been significantly increased. However, in the case where an existing ROH/IHQ converts to be an IBC, it can enjoy the reduced tax rate of 8% provided that it meets the original minimum expenditure requirement of THB 15 million. 
If an IBC does not meet the rules and conditions prescribed or does not otherwise qualify as an IBC in any accounting period, the benefits will be revoked on a year-by-year basis. If the company does not meet the conditions for more than one accounting period, or has none of the characteristics for operating as an IBC, the tax benefits will be terminated with effect from the first accounting period.
The taxable profit and loss of an IBC must be computed separately between the IBC and non-IBC businesses and between (i) headquarters and treasury management services, and (ii) royalties. Common expenses are to be allocated based on the proportion of revenue of the IBC and non-IBC businesses.
Tax losses must be maintained separately, as follows:
  * Headquarters and treasury management services.
  * Royalties.
  * Non-IBC business.


Tax returns must be filed separately for (i) headquarters and treasury management services, (ii) royalties, and (iii) non-IBC business.
## Foreign tax credit
A Thai company can use foreign tax paid on business income or dividends as a credit against its CIT liability. However, the credit cannot exceed the amount of Thai tax on the income.
