Relief for life insurance premiums (including deferred annuities) for the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse is restricted to the actual premium paid to an insurance company by the individual during the year preceding the year of assessment. In relation to a deferred annuity product, any portion withdrawn before the end of five years from the date the premium was paid will be subject to income tax at the point of withdrawal.
