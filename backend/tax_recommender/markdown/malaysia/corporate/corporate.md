The following are the tax incentives announced for the Forest City SFZ:
  * Family offices: 0% corporate income tax (CIT) rate for family offices under the Single-Family Office Scheme coordinated by the Securities Commission.

## New Investment Incentive Framework 
A New Investment Incentive Framework is expected to be implemented in the third quarter of 2025, which focuses on high-value activities as opposed to a product-based approach. Among the initiatives that can be expected under the new framework are:
  * Supply chain resilience: To strengthen the local supply chains and ecosystem of key sectors, the proposals include: 


     * Double deduction for multinational enterprises (MNEs) on corporate expenditure of up to 2 million Malaysian ringgit (MYR) _per annum_ for three consecutive years. 


    * Tax deduction on value of investment made by MNEs or its suppliers in joint venture with other local suppliers. 


    * Outcome-based tax incentives to be given to local suppliers. 
  * Establishment of economic clusters based on the industry speciality of the states in Malaysia (e.g. renewable energy in Perlis and Sabah and specialised chemicals in Pahang and Terengganu).
  * Special tax incentive for investment made in 21 economic sectors in the states of Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Sabah, and Sarawak. This is to encourage economic spillover effects to reduce the economic disparity between regions.
