## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Malaysia has a wide variety of incentives covering the major industry sectors. Tax incentives can be granted through income exemption or by way of allowances. Where incentives are given by way of allowances, any unutilised allowances may be carried forward indefinitely to be utilised against future statutory income, except for certain incentives, such as reinvestment allowance and investment allowance for approved service projects, where a seven-year limitation applies.
In compliance with the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) criteria under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 5 (Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, Taking into Account Transparency and Substance), Malaysia has amended the legislation in relation to the tax incentives to:
  * remove ring-fencing features
  * exclude IP income from the incentives, and 
  * stipulate the substantial activities requirements.


The following are the major types of incentives available in Malaysia.
## Pioneer status (PS) and investment tax allowance (ITA)
Companies in the manufacturing, agricultural, and hotel and tourism sectors, or any other industrial or commercial sector, that participate in a promoted activity or produce a promoted product may be eligible for either PS or ITA.
PS is given by way of exemption from CIT on 70% of the statutory income for five years and the remaining 30% is taxed at the prevailing CIT rate. ITA is granted on 60% qualifying capital expenditure incurred for a period of five years and is utilised against 70% of the statutory income, while the 30% balance is taxed at the prevailing CIT rate.
A company that intends to undertake reinvestment before expiration of its PS or ITA status may opt for reinvestment allowance, provided it surrenders its PS or ITA status.
The PS and ITA incentives are enhanced for the following types of projects:
Qualifying industry | Pioneer status | Investment tax allowance  
---|---|---
