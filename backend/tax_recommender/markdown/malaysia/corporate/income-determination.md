## Corporate - Income determination
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
## Inventory valuation
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost may be determined using one of several methods (e.g. unit cost, average cost, or first in first out [FIFO]), as long as the basis used is consistent for each year.
## Capital gains
Companies, LLPs, co-operatives, and trust bodies are subject to CGT from 1 January 2024 on:
  * Gains from disposal of: 
    * Shares in unlisted companies incorporated in Malaysia.
    * Shares in a foreign incorporated company deriving value from real property in Malaysia.
  * Gains from disposal of all types of capital assets situated outside Malaysia, remitted into Malaysia.


However, exemption is given for:
  * Gains from disposal of shares in unlisted companies incorporated in Malaysia or shares in foreign incorporated companies deriving value from real property in Malaysia, made on or after 1 January 2024 to 29 February 2024,  and in the case of a resident unit trust (which is not a Real Estate Investment Trust or Property Trust Fund listed on Bursa Malaysia) for disposals made on or after 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2028. The exemption does not apply where the gains are treated as business income.


  * Gains from disposal of all types of capital assets situated outside Malaysia (excluding intellectual property [IP] rights), which are received in Malaysia from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026, by companies, LLPs, co-operatives, and trust bodies resident in Malaysia that meet economic substance requirements.


The CGT rates are as follows:
### Capital asset situated in Malaysia
Acquisition date of capital asset | CGT rate  
---|---  
On net gain (chargeable income) | On gross disposal price  
Before 1 January 2024 | 10% | or 2%  
From 1 January 2024 | 10% | Not applicable  
### Disposal of all types of capital asset situated outside Malaysia, remitted into Malaysia
Based on prevailing income tax rate of the taxpayer:
  * Companies, LLPs, and trust bodies: 24% (headline)
  * Co-operatives: 0% to 24% (scaled rates)


### Other gains on capital assets
All other gains on capital assets are not subject to tax, except for gains arising from the disposal of real property situated in Malaysia, which is not subject to CGT from 1 January 2024, is subject to RPGT (_see the_ _section for more information_).
## Dividend income
Malaysia is under the single-tier tax system. Dividends are exempt in the hands of shareholders. However, it has been proposed that a 2% dividend tax be imposed on individuals on dividend income exceeding MYR 100,000. This proposal is expected to take effect from year of assessment 2025 (_see the section in the Individual tax summary for more information_). Companies are not required to deduct tax from dividends paid to shareholders, and no tax credits will be available for offset against the recipientâ€™s tax liability. Corporate shareholders receiving exempt single-tier dividends can, in turn, distribute such dividends to their own shareholders, who are also exempt on such receipts.
### Stock dividends
A Malaysian corporation may distribute bonus shares tax-free to shareholders.
## Interest income
Interest income accruing in or derived from Malaysia or received in Malaysia from outside Malaysia is subject to CIT. Exemptions granted include interest income earned by a non-resident person from deposits placed in designated financial institutions in Malaysia.
## Royalty income
Royalty income accruing in or derived from Malaysia or received in Malaysia from outside Malaysia is subject to CIT. Malaysia has a wide definition of royalty that also includes software, visual images or sounds transmitted via satellite, cable, or fibre optic, and radio frequency spectrum. Payments to non-residents falling within the definition of royalty will be subject to WHT requirements. However, certain royalty income earned by a non-resident person may be exempted from tax.
## Foreign income
A tax-resident is taxed on income derived from Malaysia and foreign-sourced income remitted to Malaysia, except for the following foreign-sourced income received in Malaysia (subject to conditions): 
  * Dividend income received by resident companies and limited liability partnerships.
  * All classes of income received by resident individuals, except for resident individuals who carry on business through a partnership.
  * All classes of income received by a resident unit trust that is not a Real Estate Investment Trust or Property Trust Fund listed on Bursa Malaysia.


Income of a resident company from the business of air/sea transport, banking, or insurance is taxed on a worldwide basis.
Taxation on a worldwide basis does not apply when income attributable to a Labuan business activity of a Labuan branch or subsidiary of a Malaysian bank is subject to tax under the Labuan Business Activity Tax Act 1990. This exception will not apply if the Labuan entity has made an irrevocable election to be taxed under the Income Tax Act 1967 in respect of its Labuan business activity.
Relief from double taxation is available by means of a bilateral credit if there is a governing tax treaty or unilateral relief where there is no treaty. The relief is restricted to the lower of Malaysian tax payable or foreign tax paid if there is a treaty, or one-half of the foreign tax paid if there is no treaty.
Undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries is not taxable.
