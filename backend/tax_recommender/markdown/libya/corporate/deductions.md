## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 01 December 2024
Taxable income is determined after deducting all expenditure and costs incurred in the realisation of the gross income (_for more details on the deemed profit basis of assessment on branches of foreign companies, see the section_).
For any entity (not a foreign branch) seeking to be assessed on an add-back basis, it should ensure, in accordance with Stamp Duty Law, that the majority of its costs can be supported by tax-registered documents (i.e. declared payrolls and registered contracts and invoices).
