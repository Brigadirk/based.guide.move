## Social security contributions
### Health contributions
Employers are obligated to make monthly health contribution payments equal to 9% of the total compensation paid to the employee.
Employees must choose affiliation with either the National Health System (_EsSalud_) or the Private Health System (_Entidades Promotoras de Salud_ or EPS). 25% of the amount paid to the EPS may be used as a credit against _EsSalud_ contributions.
### Pension funds contributions
Employers must apply monthly withholdings for pension funds contributions equal to (i) 13% of the compensation received by the employee in cases where the employee is affiliated with the National Pension System or (ii) approximately 12.5% in cases where the employee is affiliated with the Private Pension System (in this case, 10% corresponds to their personal pension account and almost 2.5% to insurance and commissions for managing the fund).
Should a foreign individualâ€™s labour contract end and the individual leaves Peru, the pension funds deposited in the Private Pension System (the aforementioned 10%) can be transferred to their pension fund abroad or wired to an account of the employee in a foreign bank if no individual pension fund abroad is available.
