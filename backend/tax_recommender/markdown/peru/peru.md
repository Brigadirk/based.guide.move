# Peru
## Overview
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Peru, located on South America's central Pacific coast, is bordered by Brazil and Bolivia to the east, Chile to the south, and Colombia and Ecuador to the north. Peru declared independence in 1821 and is divided into 25 regions, with Lima as its capital. The official language of Peru is Spanish, and the currency is the sol (PEN).
The Peruvian economy will reach a growth rate of 3.1% in 2025 supported by a greater dynamism of domestic demand, associated with higher investments and improved private consumption in an environment of low inflation, favourable financing conditions, and the consolidation of improved expectations among economic agents. 
Peru is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), with several bilateral agreements based on most favoured nation treatment on a reciprocal basis. In recent years, Peru’s foreign trade policy has promoted an aggressive trade liberalisation to successfully insert Peru in the global economy. To that end, Peru has signed several trade agreements that aim to further access to the country’s main trading partners, including the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador), Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela), Pacific Alliance (Colombia, Chile, and Mexico), EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), the European Union (EU), Australia, Chile, China, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States (US), and Venezuela.
Peru has also signed trade agreements soon to be effective with Guatemala, Hong Kong and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). It is currently negotiating agreements with El Salvador, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua and Turkey, the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and the Doha Development Round.
PwC Peru supports clients with the local knowledge and skills of its people and with access to a broad range of other professionals across the PwC global network of firms. PwC Peru is organised by industries, with a focus on financial services, energy, mining, telecommunications, retail, and government. PwC Peru has tax professionals that offer a wide variety of services, including in the areas of legal consulting, tax compliance, tax consulting, and transfer pricing.
