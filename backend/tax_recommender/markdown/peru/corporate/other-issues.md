## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
A Model 1 Intergovernmental agreement (IGA) is treated as 'in effect' by the United States (US) Treasury as of 1 May 2014. The US and Peruvian governments have reached an agreement in substance, and Peru has consented to disclose this status. In accordance with this status, the text of such IGA has not been released, and financial institutions in Peru are allowed to register on the FATCA registration website consistent with the treatment of having an IGA in effect, provided that the jurisdiction continues to demonstrate firm resolve to sign the IGA as soon as possible.

## Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) Report
As of 2019, legal persons and entities are required to identify, obtain, update, declare, retain, and provide information about their ultimate beneficiaries and, in this regard, they have to submit the UBO Report.
The Peruvian tax administration established that any legal person considered as a principal taxpayer in Peru had until 23 December 2019 to submit the Report. Furthermore, in March 2022, the Peruvian tax administration provided a new schedule stating that:
  * Legal persons that in 2021 generated a net taxable income greater than 1,000 tax units had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of May 2022.
  * Legal persons that in 2021 generated a net taxable income between 500 tax units and 1,000 tax units had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of August 2022.
  * Legal persons that in 2022 generated a net taxable income greater than 300 tax units and were not required to file this affidavit before had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of May 2023.
  * Entities registered in the Taxpayers' Identification Registry (RUC) by 30 September 2024 had to file the Report within the deadline to file the monthly tax return of September 2024.


The identification of these beneficiaries is based on the following criteria: (i) the individual who directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the legal entityâ€™s shares, (ii) the individual who, acting individually or with others as a decision unit, has power to designate or remove the majority of the administrative, management, or supervisory bodies, or has decision-making power in the financial, operational, and/or commercial agreements that are adopted, or (iii) when there is no possibility to identify an individual by criteria (i) and (ii), the ultimate beneficiary of the legal entity that should be reported is the individual within the company with the highest administrative position.
## Special Regime for Tax Debts
To provide greater flexibility to taxpayers in fulfilling their tax obligations, a Regime was approved to establish a special instalments payment plan for tax debts. The tax debts that can be eligible for the Regime are the ones generated until December 2023. The Regime offers three payment options: cash payment, summary payment and instalments payment.
