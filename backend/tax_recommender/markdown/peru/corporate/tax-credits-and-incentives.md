## Foreign tax credit
Pursuant to the PITL, taxpayers may deduct the foreign income taxes paid due to their foreign-source income levied by the PITL, provided that it doesn't exceed the amount that results from applying the average rate of the taxpayer to the incomes obtained abroad, or the tax paid abroad. The amount that, for any circumstance, is not used in the corresponding fiscal year cannot be set off (or compensated) in others fiscal years or be refunded.
As of 1 January 2020, the following will be taken into account:
  * Tax credit will be granted for the entire tax paid abroad that falls upon income taxed by the PITL.
  * Taxes paid abroad, whatever its denomination, shall bear the characteristics of income taxes.


Taxes paid abroad should be converted to national currency (the taxpayer should apply the average purchase price exchange rate corresponding to 31 December of the fiscal year in which the income was obtained). Since 1 January 2019, specific rules on tax credits were introduced for domiciled entities. As of 2019, domiciled entities will be able to deduct the following taxes as credits (specific requirements will apply):
  * Income tax paid or withheld abroad for dividends distributed ('direct credit') by non-domiciled entities ('first level entities').
  * Income tax paid abroad for the performance of a business carried out by the first level entities ('indirect first level credit') in proportion of the above-mentioned dividends.
  * Income tax paid abroad for the performance of a business carried out by non-domiciled entities that distribute dividends to first level entities, in proportion to such dividends ('indirect second level credit').


## Special deduction regime for projects related to scientific research, technological development, and technological innovation
A special deduction regime has been established for projects related to scientific research, technological development, and technological innovation. As of 1 January 2020, taxpayers investing in these projects will be able to deduct the expenses incurred as follows:
  * For taxpayers whose net income does not exceeds 2,300 tax units: 
    * 240% if the project is executed directly by the taxpayer or through centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation domiciled in Peru.
    * 190% if the project is executed by non-domiciled centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation.
  * For taxpayers whose net income exceeds 2,300 tax units: 
    * 190% if the project is executed directly by the taxpayer or through centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation domiciled in Peru.
    * 160% if the project is executed by non-domiciled centres of scientific research, technological development, or technological innovation.
