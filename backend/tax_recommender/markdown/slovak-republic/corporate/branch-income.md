## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
A foreign company may trade through a Slovak branch, which must be registered in the Slovak Commercial Register. The taxable income of the branch must not be lower than that which an independent entity (e.g. a Slovak company) would achieve from carrying out similar activities under similar conditions. If the branchâ€™s taxable income cannot be assessed based on its income less costs, as adjusted for tax purposes, certain other methods may be used. A taxpayer may ask the tax authorities in writing to approve such a method.
