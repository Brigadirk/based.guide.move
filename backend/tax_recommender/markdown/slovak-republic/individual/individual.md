Within 2023, some amendments on the taxation of the natural persons were adopted:
  * From 1 August 2023, the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules for natural persons, which were introduced from 1 January 2023, are cancelled. Under the transitional provisions, the related tax liability incurred under the CFC rules effective till 31 July 2023 ceases on 1 August 2023. If the tax is already paid, it is treated as a tax overpayment.


Note that the tax legislation in the Slovak Republic (Slovakia) is subject to frequent amendments and new official interpretations; consequently, it is advisable to contact PwC Slovakia for up-to-date information.
