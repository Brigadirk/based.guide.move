The tax bonus for dependent children older than 18 years is abolished. Additionally, limits on taxable income for the application of the tax bonus are introduced.

It is only available to Slovak tax residents with their permanent residence in Slovakia or to Slovak tax non-residents having at least 90% of their worldwide income from Slovak sources.
