## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Moldovan residents (both Moldovan citizens and foreigners) are subject to taxation for their income received during the fiscal period from any sources within the Republic of Moldova, as well as from sources outside the country for their work activity effectively performed in the Republic of Moldova (except income that is expressly tax exempt under the Moldovan law).
Moldovan citizens receiving investment and financial income from sources outside Moldova are also subject to tax on this income in Moldova.
At the same time, individuals qualifying as non-residents for Moldovan personal income tax (PIT) purposes are subject to Moldovan tax for the income derived from Moldovan sources (e.g. income received from property located in Moldova, remuneration for activity performed in Moldova, interest and royalties received from Moldovan legal entities).
