## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Employment income
Employee gross income includes basic pay, overtime pay, supplementary pay, awards and bonuses, compensation from unused holiday or vacation time, compensation for dismissal, as well as benefits in kind (e.g. housing allowances, compensation for school fees, food, and personal travel expenses).
Mandate relationships between the legal entity and the administrator will be recognised for tax purposes as employment relationships and taxed similarly to salary.
Income obtained by individuals is taxed on a cash basis. Individuals are entitled to certain deductions and exemptions from their taxable income.
Moldovan tax law provides for special rules (i.e. tax exemption) regarding the income obtained by members of diplomatic missions, and other missions accredited as such, and their personnel.
## Capital gains
There is no separate capital gains tax (CGT). Capital gains in the case of private individuals are equal to 50% of the difference between the sale price and the purchase price (i.e. including all costs related to the acquisition of capital assets) and have to be included in the gross income of the individual for the year when the income is obtained.
In addition, under certain conditions, capital gains derived from the sale of a permanent abode are non-taxable.
New provisions on capital gains entered into force on 1 January 2023.
  * Income or losses from the sale of a vehicle (except vintage vehicles of historical or ethnographic interest) that was in the seller’s possession for at least three years prior to the date of sale are not recognised for tax purposes.
  * The increase or loss of capital resulting from the sale, exchange, or other forms of transfer of common property is determined by one of the owners (co-owners), based on the joint written agreement, as the difference between the amount received and the value base of the assets.


Starting with January 2024, capital gain or loss will not be recognised in the case of:
  * Redistribution (transmission) of property between spouses or former spouses if this results from the need to divide the mutual property in the event of divorce.
  * Redemption and/or exchange of debt securities and bonds by their issuers.
  * Redemption and/or exchange of government securities by the Ministry of Finance or primary dealers in accordance with the law.
  * The exercising of the right, as provided for in the option, to buy or sell equity assets and/or convert options. 


As of 01 January 2025, in case of transactions involving shares acquired at a preferential price or for free under a stock option plan, the capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales price (the amount received or income obtained) and the shares' basis value.
