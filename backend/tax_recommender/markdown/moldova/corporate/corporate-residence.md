According to Moldovan tax law, a tax resident is a legal entity organised or managed in Moldova or that has its main place of business in Moldova. In practice, tax residency is determined by the place of incorporation.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Based on the Moldovan tax law, a PE is a fixed place of business through which a non-resident carries out, wholly or partly, either directly or through a dependent agent, entrepreneurial activity in the territory of Moldova.
Due to the regulatory environment in Moldova, as well as certain difficulties in operating a PE in Moldova, foreign enterprises operating through a PE in Moldova are not common.
