## Personal income tax rates
The personal income tax (IPR) is calculated according to the following annual progressive tax table:
Bracket number | Taxable bracket (CDF) | Gap (CDF) | Rates (%)  | Tax due as per bracket (CDF)  | Cumulative tax (CDF)   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
From | To  
1 | 0 | 1,944,000 | 1,944,000 | 3 | 58,320.00 | 58,320.00  
2 | 1,944,001 | 21,600,000 | 19,655,999 | 15 | 2,948,399.85 | 3,006,719.85  
3 | 21,600,001 | 43,200,000 | 21,599,999 | 30 | 6,479,999.70 | 9,486,716.55  
4 | 43,200,001 | And more | 40 | -  | -   
IPR cannot exceed 30% of the taxable salary.
The indemnities and allowances paid to an employee in relation with the termination of one’s contract of employment are taxed to IPR at the specific rate of 10%.
Moreover, the sums paid to casual employees (employees hired on a day-to-day basis) are subject to IPR, but at a preferential rate of 15%.
Incomes other than salaries are not subject, in practice, to IPR.
Moreover, foreign-sourced profits are not taxable in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
## Exceptional tax on expatriates’ salaries (IERE)
Where a company hires expatriates, it has to pay an exceptional tax called _Impôt Exceptionnel sur la Rémunération des Expatriés_ (IERE).
We draw your attention to the fact that this tax is not withheld at source on the expatriates’ salaries, but taken in charge by the employer.
This tax is not deductible from a corporate tax point of view (except for mining companies as well as their subcontractors).
The IERE is calculated on the IPR basis.
The substantive tax rate is 25%. 
However, 12.5% applies for mining companies during the first ten years of their activities. Afterwards, mining companies will apply the common rate. The IERE for mining companies is still deductible for CIT purposes.
The IERE is payable according to the same modalities as IPR.

## Tax returns
IPR is withheld at source by the employer via the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system only.
There is neither obligation nor possibility for employees to file an individual tax return and to pay IPR directly.
In May 2015, a single tax return was instituted for declaration and payment of taxes, social contributions, and employer contributions on salaries. In practise, the single tax return entered into force on 31 August 2015.
Natural persons remunerated by a third party under public or private law, without being bound by a company contract, will each have to submit, by 30 March at the latest, an annual recapitulative return of the personal income tax relating to the remuneration paid by their employer during the previous year. Note that the implementation modalities and the appropriate form will have to be communicated by regulation.
## Payment of tax
IPR is paid monthly by the employer by the 15th day of the month following the month of payment of the salary.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
Incomes other than salaries are not subject, in practise, to IPR.
Moreover, foreign-sourced profits are not taxable in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
## Employment income
The different taxable elements of remuneration are:
  * Salary and wages. 
  * Allowances that do not correspond to the refunding of professional expenses. 
  * Bonuses and other indemnities. 
  * Payments made by the employer in the case of breach of contract (notice allowance), excluding damages. 
  * Benefits in kind for their real value, except for: 
    * Legal family allowances (only extra-legal amount is taxable). 
    * Housing, which is not taxable provided the amount of the housing allowance is limited to 30% of the gross salary. 
    * Transport, which is not taxable provided the amount is limited to four taxi rides (executives) or four bus tickets (other employees) per day. 
    * Medical insurance. 


According to the tax doctrine, the indemnities paid in relation to professional expenses (e.g. entertainment allowance, assignment allowance) are exempt from IPR, provided they:
  * are used in accordance with their nature (note that the tax authorities may, in case of control, claim for evidences) 
  * are not overstated as regards the position of the employee concerned, and 
  * relate to the activity of the company. 


As the position of the tax authorities is very strict on these conditions, it appears that it is quite difficult to allow to the employees a ‘professional’ indemnity, which is mainly due to the fact that the employee must prove that a certain amount of expenses is linked to the payment of that indemnity.
Expatriate employees, like local ones, are liable for IPR on the total amount of salary received in connection with their activity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Please note that the minimum salary to be paid to an expatriate employee (and which will be considered as the basis of IPR) is the legal minimum salary payable in one’s country of origin.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 15 October 2024
The notion of individual tax residence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is widely defined. Article 62 of the Tax Code provides that an individual shall be considered as effectively residing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo if:
  * they have a real, effective, and permanent home available to them, or 
  * their _domus_ , their family, their centre of vital interests, or their centre of business are situated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 


The tax authorities shall examine whether the foreigner:
  * spends more than 183 days a year in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
  * appears in the organisation chart 
  * has business cards with the local company name and a local address, or 
  * signed a lease contract. 


If these elements proved to be ascertained by the tax authorities, the individual shall be considered as resident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since their entry in the country and therefore subject to IPR in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on their income since this date.

    * 2% for private companies with 51 to 300 employees.
    * 1% for private companies with over 300 employees.
  * National office of employment (_Office National de l’Emploi_ or ONEM): ONEM contribution is paid only by the employer at 0.2%.
