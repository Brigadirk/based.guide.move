## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Irrespective of their citizenship, an individual is considered a Bulgarian tax resident if they fulfil one or more of the following criteria:
  * They have a permanent address in Bulgaria (but only if their centre of vital interests is also in Bulgaria, _please see below_).
  * They reside in Bulgaria more than 183 days in any 12-month period. In this case, the individual becomes a Bulgarian tax resident in the calendar year in which the 183rd day was exceeded.
  * They have been assigned abroad by a Bulgarian company or the State.
  * Their centre of vital interests is in Bulgaria (determined with regard to the individualâ€™s personal and economic ties to the country).


If a double tax treaty (DTT) is in place, the tax residency status is determined in accordance with the provisions of the DTT, which prevail over domestic legislation.
A foreign tax resident is any individual who is not a Bulgarian tax resident.
