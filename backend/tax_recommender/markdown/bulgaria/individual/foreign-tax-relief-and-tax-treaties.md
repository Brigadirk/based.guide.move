## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Bilateral tax relief may be available under a DTT. Where no treaty protection is available, unilateral tax credit is granted to Bulgarian tax residents for taxes paid on non-Bulgarian-source income abroad, with the credit amount calculated separately for each source country (‘per-country limitation’).
