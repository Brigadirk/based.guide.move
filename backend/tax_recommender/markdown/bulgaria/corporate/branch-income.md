## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 11 June 2024
Although branches are not deemed to be separate legal persons, branches of non-resident companies have separate balance sheets and profit and loss accounts and are subject to CIT at the standard rate of 10% as well as other general taxes (e.g. VAT, property tax).
Representative offices of foreign entities are not allowed to carry out business activities and are not subject to CIT. A representative office registered under the Encouragement of Investments Act may perform only those activities that are not regarded as ‘economic activities’ (e.g. marketing activities normally carried out by a representative office and auxiliary to the activities of its head office). Representative offices do not constitute PEs of the non-resident entities unless they engage in business activities in breach of the law.
Profits repatriated by a branch to its head office abroad are not subject to WHT. However, certain income payable by a Bulgarian branch or a PE to other parts of the enterprise abroad may trigger WHT (e.g. income from technical services, interest, royalties) in certain cases.
