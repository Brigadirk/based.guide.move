## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 February 2025
Accrued expenses are deductible as long as they are business related. Contingent liabilities are deductible expenses once they are recognised in the book of accounts. Any expenditure incurred for the purpose of producing exempt income is not deductible.
## Depreciation
The following capital allowances are available in Saint Lucia:
  * An initial allowance of 20% is granted on the acquisition of industrial, agricultural, and commercial buildings (except for hotels and rental properties); on plant and machinery, including motor vehicles and furniture; and on fixtures and equipment.
  * Thereafter, annual allowances for wear and tear, ranging from 10% to 33.33%, are granted on the reducing-balance method, except for industrial and agricultural buildings, which are allowed an annual rate of 5%, and commercial buildings (except for hotels and rental properties), which are allowed an annual rate of 2.5%.


The Comptroller of the IRD may also grant, on application, a higher rate for annual allowance for assets that have higher or abnormal wear and tear.
Gains on disposal are taxable as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation recovered, and any proceeds in excess of the cost of the asset are treated as a capital gain, which is not subject to tax. Where the proceeds on disposal are lower than the tax written-down value of the asset, a balancing allowance is granted for the shortfall.
## Goodwill
Neither the amortisation of impaired goodwill nor the related write-off of it is an allowable deduction.
## Organisational and start-up expenses
All expenditures incurred in connection with incorporation costs for the establishment of a new small business enterprise are allowable deductions. A small business enterprise is an enterprise incorporated during the year of income that:
  * is wholly owned by citizens of Saint Lucia who have not been owners of previously incorporated businesses in Saint Lucia
  * employs not more than 50 persons
  * has gross income that does not exceed XCD 1 million
  * engages in an activity on the listing of preferred business activities as approved by the Minister of Finance, and
  * satisfies the provision of any law in force with respect to micro or small-scale business.


## Interest expenses
Interest on any loan, including interest payable on debentures, is an allowable deduction to the extent that the amount of such loan was used for the purpose of producing assessable income.
## Bad debt
Bad debt expense is deductible, provided it has been brought to account in generating the company’s assessable income for any income year and that the company has taken all reasonable steps to establish that the collection of such debt is unlikely.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions are an allowable deduction when the contributions are made under a deed of covenant for a period of not less than three years to any religious, charitable, medical, or educational institution; sporting body; or fund of a public character, approved by Cabinet, if such contributions are made to the Saint Lucia National Trust. However, the deduction with respect to such contributions shall not exceed 25% of the assessable income of the company for that income year.
## Pension expenses
Current annual contributions to an approved pension fund are deductible expenses. However, where a special payment is made to an approved pension fund, in relation to a period of service by an employee prior to the setting up of the approved pension fund, or to meet any actuarially ascertained insufficiency in the resources of the approved pension fund to meet its obligations to its employees, such amount shall be deductible as follows:
  1. Where the special payment does not exceed the current annual contribution, such amount is wholly deductible.
  2. Where the special payment exceeds the current annual contribution, the special payment is an allowable deduction in such years of income, not exceeding five in number, as in the opinion of the Comptroller is reasonable under the circumstances.
  3. Where under (ii) above, annual deductions are allowable over a number of years of income, the first such deduction is allowable for the income year for which the special payment is made.


## Taxes
VAT paid on goods imported or purchased, and sold in the ordinary course of business, is deductible for tax purposes. Property taxes are deductible where the property is used in producing assessable income. Income taxes, penalties, and interest on tax in arrears are not deductible.
## Other significant items
Meals and entertainment, officer’s compensation/life insurance, and payment to directors are deductible expenses, provided they are wholly and exclusively incurred by a company during that year of income for the purpose of producing its assessable income.
## Net operating losses
Net operating losses may be carried forward for up to six years if the losses have not been fully absorbed earlier. In carrying losses forward, the amount that can be claimed in any subsequent year is restricted to one-half of the assessable income of that year. Losses may not be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
There are no restrictions on the deductibility of interest paid to foreign affiliates if the transaction is carried out at arm’s length and at commercial rates. However, deductions for management charges, allocations of head office expenses, royalties, and other charges that are subject to 25% WHT are restricted to the lesser of the aggregate of those charges or 10% of all allowable business deductions, excluding cost of sales and capital allowances.
