Notes
  1. Personal credits are indexed for inflation.
  2. Any unused portion of the tax credits is not refundable.
  3. The basic/spouse/equivalent to spouse amounts are increased from CAD 2,123 to CAD 2,356 for taxpayers with taxable income below the second top tax bracket (i.e. CAD 173,205 in 2024), with the benefit of the increased personal amounts eliminated when taxable income reaches the top tax bracket (i.e. CAD 246,752 in 2024).
  4. The credit is reduced if the income of the individual or dependant exceeds a threshold.
  5. In some circumstances, the unused portion of the credit can be transferred to a spouse, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.
  6. One spouse can claim the other's medical expenses, charitable donations, and adoption expenses.
  7. For total charitable donations in a year exceeding CAD 200, the tax credit rate is: 
     * 33%, to the extent the individual has income that is subject to the federal 33% income tax rate, and
     * 29% for other donations.
  8. Starting 2019, Canadian government pension plan contributions were increased by an enhancement that will be phased-in over seven years. The enhanced portion is deductible, while the non-enhanced base portion remains eligible for a tax credit.
  9. In Quebec, federal values are reduced by 16.5%. The amount shown reflects this reduction.


## Provincial and territorial personal tax credits
The provinces and territories have many personal tax credits that are similar to the federal personal tax credits. However, the provinces and territories set the amounts of their personal tax credits.
