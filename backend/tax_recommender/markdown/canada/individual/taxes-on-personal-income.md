## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 10 December 2024
Individuals resident in Canada are subject to Canadian income tax on worldwide income. Relief from double taxation is provided through Canada's international tax treaties, as well as via foreign tax credits and deductions for foreign taxes paid on income derived from non-Canadian sources.
Non-resident individuals are subject to Canadian income tax on income from employment in Canada, income from carrying on a business in Canada and capital gains from the disposition of taxable Canadian property.
Individuals resident in Canada for only part of a year are taxable in Canada on worldwide income only for the period during which they were resident.
Personal tax credits, miscellaneous tax credits, and the dividend tax credit are subtracted from tax to determine the federal tax liability.
## Personal income tax rates
2024 federal tax rates are as follows:
Federal taxable income (CAD) | Tax on first column (CAD) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 55,867 | 0 | 15.0  
55,867 | 111,733 | 8,380 | 20.5  
111,733 | 173,205 | 19,833 | 26.0  
173,205 | 246,752 | 35,815 | 29.0  
246,752 | 57,144 | 33.0  
## Provincial/territorial income taxes
In addition to federal income tax, an individual who resides in, or has earned income in, any province or territory is subject to provincial or territorial income tax. Except in Quebec, provincial and territorial taxes are calculated on the federal return and collected by the federal government. Rates vary among the jurisdictions. Two provinces also impose surtaxes that may increase the provincial income taxes payable. Provincial and territorial taxes are not deductible when computing federal, provincial, or territorial taxable income.
All provinces and territories compute income tax using 'tax-on-income' systems (i.e. they set their own rates, brackets, and credits). All except Quebec use the federal definition of taxable income.
The following table shows the top 2024 provincial/territorial tax rates and surtaxes. The provincial/territorial tax rates are applicable starting at the taxable income levels shown below. Surtax rates apply to provincial tax above the surtax thresholds shown.
Recipient | Provincial/territorial tax | Provincial/territorial surtax  
---|---|---  
Top rate (%) | Taxable income (CAD) | Rate (%) | Threshold (CAD)  
Alberta | 15.0 | 355,845 | N/A | N/A  
British Columbia | 20.5 | 252,752 | N/A | N/A  
Manitoba | 17.4 | 100,000 | N/A | N/A  
New Brunswick | 19.5 | 185,064 | N/A | N/A  
Newfoundland and Labrador | 21.8 |  1,103,478 | N/A | N/A  
Northwest Territories | 14.05 | 164,525 | N/A | N/A  
Nova Scotia | 21.0 | 150,000 | N/A | N/A  
Nunavut | 11.5 | 173,205 | N/A | N/A  
Ontario | 13.16 | 220,000 | 20 and 36 | 5,554 and 7,108  
Prince Edward Island | 18.75 | 140,000 | N/A | N/A  
Quebec (1) | 25.75 | 126,000 | N/A | N/A  
Saskatchewan | 14.5 | 148,734 | N/A | N/A  
Yukon | 15.0 | 500,000 | N/A | N/A  
Non-resident | 15.84 (2) | 246,752 | N/A | N/A  
Notes
  1. Quebec has its own personal tax system, which requires a separate calculation of taxable income. Recognising that Quebec collects its own tax, federal income tax is reduced by 16.5% of basic federal tax for Quebec residents.
  2. Instead of provincial or territorial tax, non-residents pay an additional 48% of basic federal tax on income taxable in Canada that is not earned in a province or territory. Non-residents are subject to provincial or territorial rates on employment income earned, and business income connected with a permanent establishment (PE), in the respective province or territory. Different rates may apply to non-residents in other circumstances. 


Combined federal/provincial (or federal/territorial) effective top marginal tax rates for 2024 are shown below. The rates reflect all 2024 federal, provincial, and territorial budgets (which are usually introduced in the spring of each year). The rates include all provincial/territorial surtaxes, and apply to taxable incomes above CAD 246,752 in all jurisdictions except:
  * CAD 355,845 in Alberta.
  * CAD 252,752 in British Columbia.
  * CAD 1,103,478 in Newfoundland and Labrador.
  * CAD 500,000 in Yukon.

Recipient | Highest federal/provincial (or territorial) tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Interest and ordinary income | Capital gains (1) | Canadian dividends  
Eligible (2) | Non-eligible (2)  
Alberta | 48.0 | 24.0 | 34.3 | 42.3  
British Columbia | 53.5 | 26.8 | 36.5 | 48.9  
Manitoba | 50.4 | 25.2 | 37.8 | 46.7  
New Brunswick | 52.5 | 26.3 | 32.4 | 46.8  
Newfoundland and Labrador | 54.8 | 27.4 | 46.2 | 49.0  
Northwest Territories | 47.1 | 23.5 | 28.3 | 36.8

Non-resident (3) | 48.8 | 24.4 | 36.7 | 40.8  
Notes
  1. As a result of draft legislative proposals, which increase the capital gains inclusion rate from one half to two thirds, effective 25 June 2024, for a portion of realised capital gains exceeding a threshold (_see Capital gains in the section for more information_), the top marginal capital gains rates in the table will be 33 1/3% higher for the portion of any capital gains realised after 24 June 2024 that exceeds an annual CAD 250,000 threshold (e.g. Alberta's top capital gains rate will be 32% [24% x 1 1/3]). 
  2. _See Dividend income in the section for more information on eligible and non-eligible dividends_.
  3. Non-resident rates for interest and dividends apply only in limited circumstances. Generally, interest (other than most interest paid to arm's-length non-residents) and dividends paid to non-residents are subject to Canadian withholding tax (WHT).


## Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
In addition to the normal tax computation, individuals are required to compute an adjusted taxable income and include certain 'tax preference' items that are otherwise deductible or exempt in the calculation of regular taxable income. If the adjusted taxable income exceeds the minimum tax exemption, a combined federal and provincial/territorial tax rate is applied to the excess, yielding the AMT. The taxpayer then pays the greater of regular tax or the AMT. Taxpayers required to pay the AMT are entitled to a credit for the AMT paid, which can be applied in any of the following seven years to reduce their regular tax liability in excess of their AMT level for that year.
Recently enacted legislation changes the federal AMT calculation, effective for taxation years beginning after 2023, by:
  * increasing the federal AMT rate from 15% to 20.5% and the AMT exemption from CAD 40,000 to the start of the second from top federal tax bracket (i.e. CAD 173,205 in 2024; indexed thereafter)
  * broadening the AMT base through changes to the ‘tax preference’ inclusions in the AMT adjusted taxable income calculation, and
  * allowing only 50% of most non-refundable tax credits to reduce AMT (however, individuals can claim 80% of the charitable donations tax credit).


## Kiddie tax
A minor child that receives certain passive income under an income splitting arrangement is subject to tax at the highest combined federal/provincial (or territorial) marginal rate (i.e. up to 55%), referred to as 'kiddie tax'. Personal tax credits, other than the dividend, disability, and foreign tax credits, or other deductions cannot be claimed to reduce the kiddie tax.
## ‘Income sprinkling’
‘Income sprinkling’ (i.e. shifting income that would otherwise be realised by a high-tax individual [e.g. through dividends or capital gains] to low or nil tax rate family members) using private corporations is restricted by making certain aspects of the ‘kiddie tax’ rules (_see above_) also apply to adults in certain situations. The ‘split income’ of the adult family member will be subject to tax at the highest combined federal/provincial (or territorial) marginal rate (i.e. up to 55%). Personal tax credits, other than the dividend, disability, and foreign tax credits, or other deductions cannot be claimed to reduce this tax.
