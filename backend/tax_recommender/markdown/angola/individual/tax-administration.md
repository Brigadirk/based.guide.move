By the end of February each year, employers should file the PIT annual return ('Modelo 2'). This return should disclose the number of employees and self-employed individuals to which the entity made payments, the total amount of wages and other income paid to each individual, and the total amount of PIT withheld, with all information referring to the previous year.
