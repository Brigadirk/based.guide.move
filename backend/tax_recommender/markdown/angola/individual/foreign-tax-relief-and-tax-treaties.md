## Tax treaties
Angola has signed Double Tax Treaties (DTTs) with Portugal, the United Arab Emirates, and the People's Republic of China, which are currently in force.
Angola has also signed DTTs with some other countries, such as Cabo Verde, Mauritius, Rwanda, and Switzerland, but they are not yet in force.
There are prior compliance procedures that must be met before applying the DTT benefits.
