## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
The Personal Income Tax (PIT) Code foresees, with the respective specificities, the segmentation of income into Groups, namely:
  * Group A: Generally applicable to the income earned by employees.
  * Group B: Income earned by self-employed workers.
  * Group C: Income earned by individuals carrying out an industrial or commercial activity listed in the minimum profits table in force, attached to the PIT Code.


## Personal income tax rates
Group B and Group C taxpayers are subject to PIT in line with the regime provided for business and professional income.
The PIT Code provides the following two regimes of taxation of income derived by Group B taxpayers, and the withholding tax (WHT) rules depend on the payer's status:
  1. When the income is paid by companies, or individuals who have a simplified accounting or a general accounting model/organised accounting, the taxable amount corresponds to the value of the service and is subject to WHT at a rate of 6.5%.
  2. When the income is paid by entities that do not meet the requirements mentioned in 1 above, the taxable income is determined by the service provided based on one's accounting records, the available records of purchases, sales, and services rendered, or the data available by the tax authorities according to the specific rules applicable to taxpayers of Group B and is subject to a 25% tax rate. Taxpayers maintaining accounting books and records, simplified accounting model, or purchase and sale or services provided registration book are allowed to deduct up to 30% of incurred expenses in the computation of taxable income. Taxpayers of Group B with no organised nor simplified accounting models are not entitled to deduct costs, and the tax is levied over all income.


For Group C taxpayers with organised accounting, the taxable income (not subject to WHT) should be determined, with the necessary adjustments, in similar terms as the ones applicable to taxpayers subject to the general corporate income tax (CIT) regime. Group C taxpayers without organised accounting may determine the taxable income (not subject to WHT) according to deemed profits (table of minimum profits) or, when exceeding certain limits, the turnover (sales of goods and services rendered).
