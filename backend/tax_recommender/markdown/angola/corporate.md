## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year follows the calendar year.
## Tax returns
The annual CIT return for companies under the general and simplified regime must be submitted by the last business day of May and April, respectively, following the year to which the income relates.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers under the general regime that record sales and services excluded from WHT are required to make advance CIT payments by the end of August.
This tax is calculated by applying the rate of 2% to the total amount of sales and services excluded from the application of CIT WHT recorded by the taxpayers in the first half of the tax year. Advance payments may be offset against final CIT assessed.
The taxpayers may assess the 2% provisional payments of CIT due on sales based on the actual amounts received (rather than the turnover), but, in such cases, they are required to deliver the bank statements to the tax authorities.
Taxpayers with tax losses in the previous year may be exempt from the 2% provisional payments of CIT on sales. 
The taxpayers that replace their suppliers in the issuance of invoices (considering the self-invoicing regime defined in law) should, at the moment of payment to the supplier for the provision of goods, withhold 2%.
The final tax must be settled by the last business day of the month of April (simplified regime) and May (general regime) of the following year.
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities may carry out tax audits to the monthly and annual tax returns.
Taxpayers may challenge any decision and file an appeal to the Chief of the respective Tax Office within 30 days upon receiving the tax notification.
Based on an unsatisfactory decision of the Chief of the Tax Office, the taxpayer may also file a hierarchical appeal addressed to the President of the Tax Authorities Executive Board (AGT) within 30 days upon receiving the tax notification.
The taxpayer still has the right to appeal against the final decision of the AGT in court within 60 days upon receiving the final decision from the tax authorities.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Angola is generally five years but may be extended to ten years in case of a tax crime. It is also ten years when relating to property tax on the transfer of real estate.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The tax authorities' main areas of focus are related to:
  * WHTs due (regarding several taxes: CIT, property tax, IIT, and PIT).
  * 1% stamp tax on receipts, both from resident and non-resident entities.
  * Deductibility of costs for CIT purposes (foreign exchange differences, cost of goods sold, provisions, donations, exemptions relating to tax benefits, unduly documented expenses).
  * Consumption tax on production and on services provided by foreign entities (revoked as of October 2019).
  * VAT.
  * IIT on deemed interest.
  * Transfer pricing.


## Legal regime on invoices and equivalent documents
Invoices or similar documents must comply with the legal regime of invoices and similar documents (governed by the Presidential Decree 292/18).
Invoices and similar documents must comply with the following requirements (amongst others):
  * Include the name, firm, tax address, and tax number of the supplier.
  * Be duly dated, sequentially numbered.
  * Include details on the nature, quantity, and price of the goods and services, as well as the taxes due.
  * Be written in Portuguese and expressly mention that they were computer processed.


The legal regime of invoices and similar documents also established the following rules:
  * The existence of a monthly generic invoice for banking institutions.
  * Issuance of invoices in triplicate, being the triplicate used to accompany the transport of goods.
  * Obligation to issue invoices in a programme certified by the tax authorities, applicable to taxpayers with a turnover above AOA 10 million - as provided for in Circular No. 002/DSIVA/AGT/2022.


Suppliers that do not comply with this regime are subject to fines and penalties. In addition, the acquiring entities cannot deduct the cost for CIT purposes and will be subject to an autonomous taxation on an amount that varies depending on the extent of the failure.
Additionally, from a VAT perspective, the VAT assessed in invoices that does not comply with that foreseen in the Law is not deductible.
## Legal regime for self-billing
Presidential Decree No. 144/23, of 29 June 2023, approved the new legal regime for self-billing. 
The main changes reflect the legislator's will to encourage the use of the self-invoicing mechanism, making the regime simpler and more comprehensive. 
This regime updates the following rules: 
  * The regime now covers the acquisition of handicrafts and manufactured products, as well as the acquisition of movable property subject to registration, acquired by natural persons for their own use for more than six months. 
  * Sellers' registration obligations attributable to the purchaser are no longer required. 
  * The value from which entities engaged in wholesale trade activities must report acquisitions made to the same seller to the AGT changes from AOA 1 million to AOA 25 million.


## Legal framework on electronic processing and recording of tax procedures
Presidential Decree no. 95/23, of 6 April 2023, approved the new Legal Framework on the Electronic Communication and Processing of Tax Procedures and Tax Execution Procedure. 
This regime sets out new rules applicable to notifications and other communications of tax procedures by electronic means.
This regime mainly updates the following rules:
  * In addition to the taxpayers previously covered by this electronic communication regime (i.e. Large Taxpayers, taxpayers with a turnover or imports exceeding AOA 50 million, and tax representatives of non-tax residents), individuals or corporate entities owning real estate, cars, aircraft, boats, and other goods subject to property tax or to tax on motor vehicles are also covered by the regime.
  * Taxpayers are considered notified on the date they login to the tax authorities’ portal or five days after the tax act is made available on the portal (previously this deadline was one day).

Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Business entities with a head office or effective management in Angola are considered resident entities and are taxed on worldwide income.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Angolan concept of tax PE is based on the United Nations (UN) Double Tax Treaty Model. A foreign entity is deemed to create a PE in Angola if it (among others): 
  * has a branch, an office, or place of management in Angola
  * has a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources
  * has a construction or installation site, or provides supervision over such site, only when such site or activities exceed a period of 90 days in any given 12-month period, or
  * carries out services in Angola, including consulting, acting through employees or other personnel contracted for that end, when such services are provided for a period of at least 90 days in any given period of 12 months.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
## Depreciation
Depreciation should be computed using the straight-line method; any other method must be approved by the tax authorities.
The tax depreciation rates should respect the limits imposed by Presidential Decree No. 207/15, of 5 November 2015, and Decree No. 755/72, of 26 October 1972, altered by Decree No. 57/74, of 24 January 1974.
The table below summarises some examples of the depreciation tax rates.
Type of asset | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Office buildings | 4  
Industrial buildings | 4  
Computers | 33.33  
Furniture | Between 12.5 and 25  
Software | 20  
Light passenger vehicles | 25  
An intensive operating regime is foreseen allowing accelerated depreciation. The depreciation rate can be increased by 25% in the case of production on two shifts and by 50% in the case of continuous production.
## Goodwill
Amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for CIT purposes.
## Interest expenses
Interest costs are generally deductible for CIT purposes. Interest arising from shareholder loans may be deductible for tax purposes up to the limit that would result from the annual average interest rate established by the Angolan Central Bank.
## Bad debt
Write-off of bad debts may only be deducted for CIT purposes to the extent they result from the execution, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the debtor and they are duly supported with public certificates.
## Provisions
The following provisions are accepted as tax deductible:
  * Those related to contingencies and liabilities resulting from lawsuits for facts that would determine their inclusion as costs deductible for tax purposes.
  * Those related to bad debts, when the risk of non-recovery is considered to be justified, and subject to certain tax limits.
  * Those related to inventory depreciation within certain tax limits.
  * Those respecting the limits and rules imposed by the Insurance Supervision Institute for insurance companies, as well as the Central Bank for Financial Institutions.


In relation to doubtful debts, the regime:
  * Limits the provision’s deductibility to credits in which the risk of collection is considered duly justified. According to the tax law, the recovery risk is justified whenever: 
    * The debtor is in insolvency, recovery proceedings, and enforcement procedure.
    * The credit was claimed in court.
    * The credit is overdue for more than six months and there is proof of collection diligences.
  * Excludes from tax deductibility the provisions of credits covered by insurance, over shareholders and subsidiaries (at least 10% share), and over the state and public companies.


In relation to the losses incurred with inventories, the regime:
  * Foresees different tax limits, depending on the sector of activity.
  * Imposes that the provision is calculated by the difference between the stock’s market price and its acquisition cost.
  * Foresees a special regime for taxpayers engaged in editorial activities.


## Charitable contributions
Donations are only deductible for CIT purposes if fully compliant with the Patronage Law. The requirements imposed by this law are very restrictive.
The donations granted outside the scope of Patronage Law are also subject to autonomous taxation at a rate of 15%.
## Fines and penalties
Fines and penalties are not deductible costs for tax purposes.
## Taxes
Certain taxes are non-deductible for CIT purposes, namely the CIT itself, PIT, IIT, property tax, or taxes paid on behalf of third parties (e.g. PIT borne on behalf of the employees).
## Autonomous taxation
Confidential expenses are subject to autonomous taxation at rates of 30% and 50%. The donations granted outside the scope of Patronage Law are also subject to autonomous taxation at a rate of 15%.
The amount of autonomous taxation should be added to the taxable income in the case of donations and added to the tax due in the case of confidential expenses.
## Net operating losses
Tax losses can be carried forward for five years.
Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates are accepted for tax purposes, although the arm’s-length principle should be complied with.


# Angola
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Major taxpayers that are members of an economic group may opt to be taxed under the tax regime of group taxation. 
The option for the group taxation regime is available when:
  * The company is included in the major taxpayers list.
  * The parent company holds, directly or indirectly, at least 90% of the share capital of other companies (controlled entities), and more than 50% of the voting rights.


Some limitations apply, and the option to apply group taxation depends on the approval of the tax authorities.
## Transfer pricing
In October 2013, Angola enacted specific transfer pricing legislation through the Presidential Decree 147/13. Although published on 1 October 2013, the provisions of the decree became applicable to tax years starting on or after 1 January 2014. This legislation imposes rather demanding obligations on taxpayers.
According to Angola’s transfer pricing requirements, all taxpayers (not just large taxpayers, as per Law 26/20 of 20 July 2020), whose annual turnover exceeds AOA 7 billion at the end of the fiscal year must prepare and submit a transfer pricing documentation file within six months of the fiscal year's end.
Furthermore, in 2020, the National Bank of Angola issued a Circular Letter 002/DCC/2020 that provides guidelines for banking financial institutions regarding validating payments under service contracts with non-resident entities. It mandates that such contracts demonstrate arm's-length pricing through either transfer pricing documentation (for large taxpayers) or benchmarking studies (for other taxpayers).
Finally, while Angola is not an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member state, its transfer pricing rules align with the recommendations of the UN Transfer Pricing Manual.
## Thin capitalisation
Interest arising from shareholder loans should be deductible for tax purposes up to the limit that would result from the annual average interest rate established by the Angolan Central Bank.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There are no CFC rules in Angola.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 18 December 2024
Corporate income tax (CIT) is levied, currently at a 25% rate, on the profits deriving from business activities carried out in Angola by resident entities or non-resident entities with a tax permanent establishment (PE), as defined by Angolan domestic legislation.
Tax residents are taxed on worldwide profits, while PEs are liable to taxation on the profits attributable to the PE, sales in Angola of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind to that sold by the PE, and to any other business activity that is of the same or similar kind to that conducted by the PE.
The Angolan system has two tax regimes: the general regime and the simplified regime. The simplified regime applies to taxpayers subject to CIT who are in the VAT non-taxation regime (entities with business turnover below or equal to 25 million Angolan kwanza (AOA).
The following are excluded from the simplified regime:
  * Public companies and public entities.
  * Financial institutions.
  * Companies under special tax regimes.
  * Telecom companies.
  * Subsidiaries or branches of foreign entities.


Taxpayers who have been included in the simplified taxation regime may apply to join the general regime, if they meet the requirements to be included in it, and must submit their application to the relevant tax office by the end of February of the year to which the CIT relates.
The general regime applies to taxpayers whose revenue is over AOA 25 million for two consecutive or non-consecutive years.
Special tax regimes apply to the oil and gas industry and to the mining industry.
Exemptions from CIT are provided for non-resident shipping and airline operators (as long as reciprocity exists in the foreign jurisdiction).
## Investment Income Tax (IIT)
The IIT is due on interest, dividends, royalties, and other income of a similar nature. In Angola, the IIT Code divides such income into two sections, as follows:
### Section A
Section A includes:
  * Interest on credit facilities.
  * Interest on loans.
  * Income derived from deferred payments.


The tax is due at the moment that the income starts to be due or is presumed to be due.
A minimum annual interest rate of 6% is deemed on loan agreements and credit facilities, except if another rate is proven through a written and stamped contract.
### Section B
Section B includes (amongst others):
  * Repatriation of profits attributable to PEs.
  * Interest, premiums on the amortisation, reimbursement, and other forms of remuneration of: (i) bonds and securities or other financial instruments issued by any company, (ii) treasury bills and treasury bonds, and (iii) Central Bank Securities.
  * Interest on shareholder loans (or other shareholder financing). A deemed minimum annual interest rate equal to the rate used by the commercial banks is imposed.
  * Indemnities paid to entities for the suspension of their business activity.
  * Capital gains on shares and other financial investments.


The concept of royalties includes payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films, or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience.
### Exemptions
The following income is exempt from IIT:
  * Interest on deferred payments regarding commercial transactions.
  * Payment of dividends to Angolan CIT payers that hold a participation higher than 25% for more than one year. Such exemption only applies if the share capital of the company distributing the dividends is quoted in a stock/regulated market.
  * Interest from financial products approved by the Ministry of Finance that intend to encourage savings, capped to capital invested of AOA 500,000 for each person.
  * Interest from housing saving accounts intended to encourage savings for main permanent dwelling.


### IIT rate
The IIT rate is generally 15%, except for certain income, for which the rate is 10% or 5%.
The tax rate is 10% for the following income (amongst others):
  * Dividends and repatriation of profits.
  * Bond interest.
  * Interest from shareholder loans.
  * Capital gains.


The tax rate is 5% for the following income (amongst others):
  * Interest and capital gains on bonds, securities, or other financial instruments issued by any company, Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds, and Central Bank Securities, when these instruments are traded on a regulated market and have a maturity equal to or in excess of three years.
  * Dividends and capital gains on shares when traded in a regulated market.


### Assessment and payment
IIT due on income falling in section A of the IIT Code is, as a general rule, assessed and paid by the beneficiary entity when filing the tax return in January of the year following the taxable events. If the beneficiary is a foreign entity, the obligation to assess and deliver usually falls on the Angolan resident entity that is paying the income.
IIT due on income falling in section B of the IIT Code is, as a general rule, withheld by the paying entity.

All production, imports, and sales by public auction are subject to excise duty, with different rates of 2%,3%, 4%, 5%, 8%, 15%, 19%, 20%, 25%, and 50%, depending on the product.

The taxable amount subject to excise duty is as follows:
  * For goods produced in the country: The transactional value.
  * For imported goods: The customs value.
  * For petroleum products: The cost of production.


Producers are required to assess the excise duties when products are made available to buyers/customers and must submit them electronically by the last working day of each month.
The Excise Duties Code also provides for some exemptions, including:
  * Goods intended for education or health.
  * Goods intended for consumption as provisions for any means of collective transport of passengers with international traffic.

The establishments that produce beverages, tobacco, and its manufactured substitutes and petroleum products, referred to in Annexes I and II of this Law, must be equipped with a counting and measuring system for electronic transmission of data to the AGT in an automatic manner of information related to production. 
The counting and measurement systems referred to above must be certified by the AGT, under the terms to be regulated.

Notes
  1. Taxable persons covered by the standard or simplified VAT regimes are exempt from the 1% stamp tax on receipts, except for:

## Property tax
Property tax is levied on the taxable property value of urban and rural property owned, rental income derived from such real estate, and income derived from the sale or transfer of immovable property. 
### Leased assets
Property tax is levied on rental income at a 25% nominal rate. However, the tax basis is only 60% of the rental income, as it is presumed that 40% relates to costs. Consequently, the effective property tax rate for rental income is 15%.
The taxation of income from rented properties may not be lower than that which would result from taxing the ownership of the same immovable property if it was not generating rental income.
### Assets that are not leased
Property tax is levied as follows for the ownership of assets that are not leased:
Patrimonial value (AOA) | Property tax  
---|---  
Up to 5 million | 0.1%  
From 5,000,001 to 6 million | AOA 5,000 (fixed value)  
Over 6 million (on the excess of 5 million) (1) | 0.5%  
Notes
  1. For example, an asset registered at AOA 35 million will pay property tax only on AOA 30 million, resulting in property tax payable of AOA 150,000.


Buildings and land for construction that are not effectively being used are subject to aggravated taxation, subject to certain conditions.
### Transfer of properties
The property tax rate levied on the transfer of immovable property is 2%.
### Exemptions
The following entities are exempt from property tax (among others):
  * State and local municipalities.
  * Foreign states, when the properties are allocated to the diplomatic representation or consular, provided there is reciprocity.
  * Legalised religious institutions, when the property is allocated to religious matters.


### Payment
Rents paid by Angolan companies or individuals that carry out a commercial activity are subject to withholding tax (WHT) of 15%. The property tax withheld must be paid to the tax authorities by the end of the following month.
For property not leased, the respective owners must pay the property tax until March of the following year. The payment in six instalments is possible if approved by the tax authorities.
For property tax on the transfer of immovable property, the acquiring party must pay the tax to the tax authorities until the last working day of the month following the transaction/transfer.
### Filing requirements
Property Tax Model 1 must be filed by the taxpayers each January, disclosing the rents effectively collected in the previous year and the leasing agreements duly stamped.
## Special Levy on Foreign Exchange Operations (_Contribuição Especial sobre Operações Cambiais_ or CEOC)
CEOC is due on transfers related to agreements for the rendering of services, technical assistance, consulting and management, capital operations, and unilateral transactions.
Payments related to health and education expenses are excluded from CEOC as long as they are performed directly to the bank accounts of health and education institutions (conditions apply). Transfers of dividends, reimbursement of borrowed capital, and associated interest are equally excluded from CEOC.
The CEOC applies to natural persons or companies domiciled or headquartered in Angolan territory that request transfers of funds from a financial institution for payments subject to this Special Levy.
The applicable rate is 10% for corporate entities and 2.5% for individuals. It applies to the value of the transferred funds.
Exemptions apply to (i) the state and any of its bodies, establishments, and organisations, except public institutes and companies, and (ii) diamond companies and oil companies.
Financial institutions shall guarantee the assessment and settlement of the CEOC; otherwise, they will incur fines in an amount corresponding to the levy.
## Payroll taxes
### Personal income tax (PIT)
Resident and non-resident individuals earning income from services directly or indirectly provided to individuals or corporate entities in Angola are subject to monthly taxation (PIT) at rates progressing from 0% to 25%. Angola operates a fairly straightforward pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, in which the Angolan employer withholds monthly from each employee's gross compensation the Angolan income tax.
Individuals only deriving employment income are not required to file tax returns, as the PIT is withheld at source by their employer.
The General State Budget (GSB) for the year 2024 amended the PIT Code and established that the taxable income of Group C taxpayers whose turnover, in the financial year 2023, is equal to or less than AOA 10 million, corresponding to the volume of sales of goods and services not subject to WHT, on which the rate of 6.5% will apply.
Regardless of the volume of invoicing, taxpayers in this group who have organised accounting must follow the rules applicable to the calculation of the taxable income of taxpayers under the CIT regime, with the relevant adjustments.
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on the gross income of employees at rates of 3% for the employee (8% in case of retired employees) and 8% for the employer.
The contributions are intended to cover family, pension, and unemployment protection.
