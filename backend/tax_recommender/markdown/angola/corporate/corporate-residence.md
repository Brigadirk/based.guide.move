Business entities with a head office or effective management in Angola are considered resident entities and are taxed on worldwide income.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The Angolan concept of tax PE is based on the United Nations (UN) Double Tax Treaty Model. A foreign entity is deemed to create a PE in Angola if it (among others): 
  * has a branch, an office, or place of management in Angola
  * has a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources
  * has a construction or installation site, or provides supervision over such site, only when such site or activities exceed a period of 90 days in any given 12-month period, or
  * carries out services in Angola, including consulting, acting through employees or other personnel contracted for that end, when such services are provided for a period of at least 90 days in any given period of 12 months.
