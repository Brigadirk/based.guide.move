An agreement under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), between the government of Angola and the government of the United States (US), was signed on 9 November 2015. This FATCA regime aims to fight tax evasion of US taxable persons who hold financial assets through financial institutions outside the US territory.
The publication of Presidential Decree n.ยบ 33/20 introduced the obligation of reporting financial institutions to implement a compliance program within one year after the entry into force of this decree, which includes procedures and processes adequate for effective compliance obligations under the FATCA regime.
Based on the terms of Order no. 1169/20, after the implementation of the compliance program, the reporting financial institutions will have to certify, before the AGT, their compliance with the FATCA regime.
The reporting of financial information for the purposes of FATCA must be provided by the financial institutions to the AGT through the submission of the FATCA file via the Taxpayer Portal by 30 June of each year, with reference to the previous year.
