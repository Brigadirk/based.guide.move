## Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 17%, and the VAT regime applies equally throughout the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no reduced VAT rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Taxable persons are all individuals and legal entities registered, or required to be registered, for VAT. Any person making taxable supplies of goods and services that exceeds or is likely to exceed a threshold of 100,000 konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM) is required to register as a VAT payer.
The export of goods is zero-rated.
Taxable transactions include the supply of goods and services in Bosnia and Herzegovina by a taxable person, as well as the importation of goods to Bosnia and Herzegovina by any person. The following transactions are also taxable:
  * Transactions for no consideration or for a consideration less than the market value.
  * The private use of taxable goods by a taxable person (self-supply).


The following services are exempt from VAT in Bosnia and Herzegovina:
  * The leasing and subletting of residential houses, apartments, and residential premises for a period of longer than 60 days.

## Customs duties
The customs policy law and the rates of customs tariffs to be applied exist and are largely based on European Union (EU) standards. Bosnia and Herzegovina has signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) and the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).

If the calculated excise duty is lower than the minimally prescribed excise duty, then the minimal excise duty should be paid (the minimal duty is determined every year by the indirect tax authorities by special regulation).
  * Non-alcoholic drinks: BAM 0.1 per litre.
  * Alcohol and alcoholic drinks: BAM 8 to BAM 15 per litre of absolute alcohol.
