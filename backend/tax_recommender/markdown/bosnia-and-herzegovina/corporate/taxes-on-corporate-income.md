Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two entities: Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS), with a third region, the Brčko District (BD), being administered by both. Direct taxes are imposed at the entity/district level, while indirect tax regulations are imposed at the state level.
