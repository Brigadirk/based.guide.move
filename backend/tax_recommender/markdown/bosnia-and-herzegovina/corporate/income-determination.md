Last reviewed - 06 February 2025
Taxable profit is profit determined by adjusting the accounting profit as stated in the profit and loss statement and determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards/International Accounting Standards (IFRS/IAS) and accounting legislation, in accordance with the provisions of the CIT law. 
## FBiH income
Taxable income in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the income determined in the financial statements, increased for tax non-deductible costs and other tax non-deductible items and decreased for non-taxable items in accordance with the CIT Law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

### FBiH inventory valuation
Expenses of production in accordance with accounting regulations and IFRS/IAS shall be recognised in the value of stocks of unfinished production, semi products, and finished products for the calculation of taxable profit.
The inventory is valued by using the average price method.
### FBiH capital gains
Capital gains that increase the CIT base are all amounts that directly increase the accumulated or current profit in the balance sheet in accordance with IAS.
Capital gains that increase the CIT base are also considered to be gains from transactions of sales or transfers of assets if such profit is not included in the balance sheet. Such capital gains are determined as the difference between the value of the transaction and the purchase value, deducted for tax depreciation. If such difference is negative, it is considered as a capital loss.
For the purpose of determining the capital gains, the price of the transaction is the price stipulated in the contract, or the market price of the transaction if the stipulated price is lower than the market price.
Increase or decrease of taxpayer's equity performed in accordance with the Company Law is not considered as capital gain or loss.
