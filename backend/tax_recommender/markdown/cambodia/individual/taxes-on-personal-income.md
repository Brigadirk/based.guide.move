## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 19 September 2024
There is no personal income tax, _per se_ , in Cambodia. Instead, a monthly salary tax is imposed on individuals who derive income from employment. General consulting income is excluded from salary tax but is subject to tax on income (_see the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information on CIT_), although rules exist that may deem certain consultants as employees.
A Cambodian resident's worldwide salary is subject to Cambodia salary tax, while non-residents are taxed on Cambodian-sourced salary.
## Salary tax rates
