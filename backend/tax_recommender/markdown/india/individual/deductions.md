Such withdrawal of up to 60% of the corpus fund is exempt from tax. This applies to all subscribers. Further, nothing would be taxable if the amount is received by the nominee due to death.
  * In case of partial withdrawal from the NPS by employees, 25% of their own contribution is exempt from tax in the year of withdrawal.


### Charitable contributions
On donation of a certain amount to certain approved funds, charitable institutions, etc., an individual can claim a deduction of 50% to 100% of the amount donated, subject to restrictions provided by the law. Deduction for funds and charitable institutions in excess of INR 2,000 is to be allowed only if the donation is made otherwise than in cash. Effective 1 April 2020, a donee receiving donations will now have to prepare the statement and file it in a manner prescribed in this regard. Deduction to a donor shall be allowed subject to verification to enhance transparency.
A special fund, the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund), has been set up for providing relief to the persons affected from the outbreak of COVID-19. Donations made to the PM CARES Fund shall be eligible for 100% deduction under the Income-tax Act without any upper limit. In cases where the donations were made through the employer and no individual donation receipts were available, deduction can be claimed on the basis of Form 16/ Certificate issued by the employer.
### Education expenses
An individual can claim a deduction for interest paid on a loan taken for the purpose of his/her higher education or of his/her relative (spouse, children, or student for whom the individual is the legal guardian). It should be noted that the interest is paid by the individual out of his/her taxable income.
### Medical insurance premium
  * A deduction is available for health insurance premiums or contributions made to an approved insurance scheme by an individual for insuring the health of oneself, spouse, and dependent children. The deduction available is up to INR 25,000 (INR 50,000 where any of the insured persons is a senior citizen).
