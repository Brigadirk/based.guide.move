## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Alternate tax regime
The optional alternate personal tax regime, devoid of any deductions or exemptions, which was made the default tax regime effective 1 April 2023, continuous to be the default tax regime unless an individual chooses otherwise. Moreover, the tax rates under this regime have been revised. A rebate of 100% income tax has been allowed for resident individuals where total income does not exceed 700,000 Indian rupees (INR). The amount of the standard deduction available to a salaried taxpayer has been enhanced from INR 50,000 to INR 75,000. _See the corresponding sections of India’s individual tax summary for details_.
The taxpayers who want to opt for the old tax regime have to specifically indicate this preference in the manner as prescribed.
## Increased withholding tax (WHT) rate for royalty and fee for technical service (FTS) payments made to non-residents
The 10% special tax rate, as provided under the domestic tax laws, on royalty and FTS income earned by a non-resident or a foreign company that does not have permanent establishment (PE) in India was increased to 20%. Accordingly, royalty/FTS incomes that are chargeable to tax for a non-resident on or after 1 April 2023 will require tax to be deducted at the rate of 20% plus applicable surcharge and cess under the domestic tax laws.
However, non-residents or foreign companies can still avail the benefit of a lower tax rate provided in the tax treaties, subject to compliance with the treaty eligibility conditions.
## E-filing of Form 10F without Permanent Account Number (PAN) enabled
In order to be eligible to claim the tax treaty benefits, a non-resident is, _inter alia_ , required to furnish certain details in Form 10F. The said form is required to be filed electronically on the income tax portal. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has enabled non-residents, who do not have a PAN (i.e. tax identification number) and are not required to have a PAN, to e-file Form 10F on the income tax portal by creating an account without the requirement of first obtaining a PAN.
## Withdrawal of small outstanding direct tax demands
In the Interim Budget 2024-25, the Finance Minister announced withdrawal of petty, non-verified, non-reconciled, or disputed tax demands under the Income-tax Act, 1961, Wealth-tax Act, 1957 and Gift-tax Act, 1958 (relevant Act). To bring this into effect, the CBDT has issued an order broadly providing the following guidelines/conditions based on which the tax demands will be withdrawn:
  * The monetary limit of outstanding tax demands (which are outstanding as on 31 January 2024 under the relevant Acts) that are to be remitted or extinguished are as follows:
    * Up to tax year 2009/10: Each demand entry up to INR 25,000.
    * For tax years 2010/11 to 2014/15: Each demand entry up to INR 10,000.


  * The tax demands will include the principal amount of tax, interest, surcharge, cess, penalty, or fee levied under the relevant Acts. However, remission/extinguishment of outstanding demands qua a particular taxpayer cannot exceed the maximum ceiling limit of INR 100,000 and any demand entry exceeding the individual monetary limit will not form part of the maximum ceiling limit.
  * Fractions of demand will be ignored for computing the maximum ceiling.
  * Remission/extinguishment of demand will be undertaken in a chronological manner.
  * Interest levied under the relevant Acts on account of delay in payment of demand will not be considered.
  * The demand waived will not be regarded as income of the taxpayer, and no additional tax liability will arise in the hands of the taxpayer pursuant to remission or waiver of tax demands.
  * There will be no remission/extinguishment of outstanding demands with respect to tax deduction at source (TDS) and tax collection at source (TCS) provisions of the income tax law.
  * Post the remission/extinguishment of demands, no interest on account of delay in payment of demand will be levied under any relevant Acts.
  * Withdrawal/remission of tax demands will not give any right to the taxpayers to claim credit or refund of waived amount, and such waiver will also not grant immunity from any ongoing criminal proceedings or litigations in the case of a taxpayer.
  * The withdrawal will be implemented by Directorate of Income-tax (Systems) / Centralised Processing Centre (CPC), Bengaluru, preferably within two months from the date of CBDT order, i.e. 13 February 2024.


## Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, 2024
With the objective of reducing litigation and settling pending disputes, the government of India has decided to introduce a Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, 2024 (VsV Scheme, 2024). This scheme provides for a dispute settlement mechanism pursuant to which eligible taxpayers can settle their pending tax disputes by paying a specified portion of the tax arrears. It is noteworthy that the provisions of this scheme are largely aligned with the earlier Vivad se Vishwas Scheme of 2020.
Taxpayers should consider reviewing their pending income tax litigation and, based on the likelihood of success and estimated cost of continuing the litigation, decide whether to opt for the VsV Scheme, 2024.


# India
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
Taxation of individuals in India is primarily based on their residential status in the relevant tax year. The residential status of individuals is determined independently for each tax year and is ascertained on the basis of their physical presence in India during the relevant tax year and past years. _See the section for more information_.
The following types of residential status are envisaged for an individual:
  * Resident in India, which is further divided into the following two categories: 
    * Resident and ordinarily resident (ROR).
    * Resident but not ordinarily resident (RNOR).
  * Non-resident in India (NR).


Under Indian tax laws, the scope of taxation differs as per the residential status of an individual:
  * RORs are subject to tax in India on their worldwide income, wherever received.
  * RNORs are subject to tax in India only in respect to income that accrues/arises or is deemed to accrue/arise in India, or is received or deemed to be received in India, or is from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India.
  * NRs are subject to tax in India only in respect to income that accrues/arises or is deemed to accrue/arise, or is received or deemed to be received, in India.


RNOR and NR individuals are not subject to tax in respect to their income earned and received outside of India.
## Personal income tax rates
### Alternate personal tax regime (APTR)
Effective 1 April 2024, i.e. tax year 2025/26, the tax rates under the ATPR, devoid of any deductions or exemptions, have been revised as follows:
Taxable income (INR) | Tax on column 1 (INR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over   
0 | 300,000 | - | 0  
300,000 | 700,000 | - | 5  
700,000 | 1,000,000 | 20,000 | 10  
1,000,000 | 1,200,000  | 50,000 | 15  
1,200,000 | 1,500,000 | 80,000 | 20  
1,500,000 | 140,000 | 30  
Under the APTR, the taxpayer is not eligible to claim certain exemptions/deductions/set-off of losses/carryforward of losses, such as:
  * Leave travel allowance.
  * House rent allowance.
  * Allowance under which incomes that do not form part of the total income of the Income-tax Act, except certain prescribed allowances.
  * Exemption of free food and beverages through vouchers provided by the employer.
  * Deduction for professional tax.
  * Deduction of interest payment on housing loans for self-occupied property and restrictions on set-off of loss from let out property.
  * All Chapter VIA deductions of the Income-tax Act available for expenditure by way of employee’s contribution to provident fund, children tuition fees, insurance premium, donations, medical premium, etc., except employer’s contribution to notified pension scheme, such as National Pension Scheme.


Note that this is not an exhaustive list and just an overview of certain deduction/exemptions that are not allowed in the APTR.
The APTR option can be exercised for every financial year (FY) if the taxpayer has no business income. If the taxpayer has business income, the option, once exercised, will be mandatory for all subsequent financial years as well, with only a one-time change being permitted later.
The Revenue Department has clarified that the employer will seek information from each of its employees having salary income regarding their intended tax regime, and each such employee will intimate the same to the employer. Upon intimation, the employer will compute the total income and deduct tax at source thereon according to the option exercised.
If intimation is not made by the employee, it will be presumed that the employee continues to be in the default tax regime and has not exercised the option to opt out of the alternate tax regime.
It is also clarified that the employee can elect to change the option of the tax regime at the time of filing one's India tax return.
### Old tax regime
The slab rates applicable to individuals for tax year 2022/23 are as follows:
Taxable income (INR) | Tax on column 1 (INR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over   
0 | 250,000 | - | 0  
250,000 | 500,000 | - | 5  
500,000 | 1,000,000 | 12,500 | 20  
1,000,000 | 112,500 | 30  
The basic exemption limit for resident individuals who are 60 years of age or more but less than 80 years of age at any time during the tax year is INR 300,000. For resident individuals who are 80 years of age or more, it is INR 500,000.
## Surcharge
In addition to the income tax, a surcharge is to be levied where the total income of individuals exceeds INR 5 million, as follows:
Taxable income (INR) | Surcharge (%)  
---|---  
Up to 5 million | 0  
Above 5 million but up to 10 million | 10  
Above 10 million but up to 20 million | 15  
Above 20 million but up to 50 million | 25  
Above 50 million | 25 (37 in case old tax regime is opted)  
However, on income arising on account of long-term capital gains, the rate of surcharge would be capped at 15%.
## Health and education cess
Health and education cess at the rate of 4% of the income tax and surcharge (if applicable) will be levied to compute the effective tax rate of individuals.
## Tax rebate
Resident individuals are eligible for a tax rebate of the lower of the income tax or INR 12,500 where the total income does not exceed INR 500,000. However, in case the alternate tax regime is exercised, tax rebate would be the lower of the income tax or INR 25,000 where the total income does not exceed INR 700,000.
## COVID-19 reliefs
  * Any payment received from employer and/or any other person for medical treatment of COVID-19 during FY 2019/20 and subsequent years is fully exempt in the hands of the recipient individual.
  * Any ex-gratia payment made by the employer to the family members of an employee who died on account of COVID-19 during FY 2019/20 and subsequent years is fully exempt from tax in the hands of the recipient family members without any limit. However, the tax exemption shall be limited to INR 1 million in aggregate where such amount is received from any other persons.


## Alternative minimum tax (AMT)
AMT is applicable to all persons, other than a company, having income from a business or profession. AMT means an amount of tax that is computed on the adjusted total income. The taxpayer is liable to pay tax on such income at a rate of 18.5% (plus surcharge and health and education cess) on the adjusted total income. For a person located in an international financial services centre deriving income solely in convertible foreign exchange, one shall be liable to pay tax on such income at the rate of 9% (plus surcharge and health and education cess). AMT paid in a year is eligible to be carried forward for set-off against normal tax liability for 15 years. In case of an individual, Hindu undivided family (HUF), an association of persons, a body of individuals, or an artificial juridical person, AMT is not applicable where the adjusted total income does not exceed INR 2 million.
## Local taxes on income
Profession taxes imposed by certain states on individuals are minimal and deductible while calculating taxable income.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Taxable period
The Indian tax year is from 1 April to 31 March.
## Tax returns
An individual is required to file a separate return of income. Joint filing is not permitted. Husband and wife are treated as separate and independent individuals for the purposes of Indian income tax.
An individual engaged in a business or profession is required to have the books of account audited under the tax laws if the turnover/total sales/gross receipts exceeds INR 10 million in the case of a business or where the gross receipts exceed INR 5 million in the case of a profession.
The due date for individuals to file their tax returns is 31 July of the year immediately following the relevant tax year. In cases where the individual is required to have one's books of account audited under the tax laws, the due date is 31 October of the immediately following the relevant tax year. However, a belated/revised return can also be filed by 31 December, after close of the relevant tax year. 
In cases where tax returns are filed after the due date, a late fee of INR 5,000 will be levied. However, in case taxable income does not exceed INR 500,000, this fee will not exceed INR 1,000.
Individuals who are 80 years old or more and qualify as RORs of India have an option to file their tax returns manually. It is mandatory to file the return electronically if:
  * there is a claim of refund
  * the total income exceeds INR 500,000, or
  * where the individual qualifies as an ROR and possesses foreign assets or has the signing authority for any of one's accounts located outside India.


To e-file the return, taxpayers have been using digital signatures for paperless filing, or could opt to forward the details of the e-filed return to the Central Processing Centre. Now, the government has announced a paperless way of e-filing of tax returns _via_ Electronic Verification Code (EVC). The EVC is a 10-digit alpha-numeric code that is unique for each Permanent Account Number (PAN) and is generated for the purpose of electronic verification of the person in the e-filing website.
### Mandatory furnishing of return of income
It is mandatory to file a return of income in the following cases:
  * An individual qualifying as an ROR and owning foreign assets (as a beneficial owner or otherwise) or having signing authority in any account located outside India. 
  * A person deposits amounts more than INR 10 million in one or more current accounts maintained with banks or co-operative banks.
  * A person incurs expenditure exceeding INR 200,000 for oneself/any other person for travel to a foreign country.
  * A person incurs expenditure exceeding INR 100,000 towards consumption of electricity.
  * A person who fulfils such other conditions as may be prescribed.


Resident senior citizens (aged 75 years or more) having only pension and bank interest income from the specified bank are exempted from the return filing requirement, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.
## Payment of tax
Final income tax payment will be made on or before the due date of filing of the income-tax return.
Further, if the taxpayer’s estimated tax liability (for the current tax year) after reducing withholding tax/foreign tax credit is likely to exceed INR 10,000, then the taxpayer must pay advance tax during the tax year on the basis of estimated income in four instalments: by 15 June (15% of the estimated annual tax liability), by 15 September (45% of the estimated annual tax liability), by 15 December (75% of the estimated annual tax liability), and by 15 March of the tax year (100% of the estimated annual tax liability). Resident senior citizens are exempted from the requirement of advance tax payments unless they have income from a business or profession.
### Withholding tax
An individual may not be required to withhold tax from payments he/she makes. However, in certain cases, an individual (engaged in business or profession) is required to withhold tax if he/ she is liable for audit under the tax law in the tax year immediately preceding the tax year in which the payment is made. In case of many other payments, the tax laws require a payer to withhold tax from the payment and deposit the same into the Indian Government Treasury within specified timelines. Such payers are also required to obtain a Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) once, and file periodic returns of tax withheld. 
Similarly, where the individual is making payment of rent to a resident in excess of INR 50,000 per month, he/she is liable to withhold tax on such payment at the rate of 5% in the last month of the tax year or last month of tenancy, whichever is earlier. With effect from 1 October 2024, such rate would be reduced to 2%.
Any transfer of immovable property (any land, building, or part of a building) to a resident will attract a withholding tax of 1% of the agreed consideration or stamp duty value (whichever is higher) if the consideration and stamp duty value or value for a transfer is INR 5 million or more. This consideration includes all charges of the nature of club membership fee, car parking fee, electricity and water facility fee, maintenance fee, advance fee, or any charge of similar nature that are incidental to transfer of the immovable property. The withholding tax provisions will not apply in cases of transfer of agricultural land.
An employer is required to withhold tax from salaries at the time of payment of salary and deposit the same into the Government Treasury by the seventh day of the month following the month in which tax is withheld, except for the month of March, when the tax can be deposited on or before 30 April. An employer will obtain evidence from the employees in the prescribed form and manner. This is aimed to curb the practices followed by companies of allowing deductions/exemptions on the basis of mere declaration by the employees.
Currently, the employer is not allowed to consider the tax collected at source (TCS) as a credit for calculating tax due on the salary income. This has resulted in cash flow issues to the employees. With effect from 1 October 2024, the employer will also consider TCS while computing the net tax due on salary income.
Also, currently, there is no specific provision that allows the parent of a minor to avail the TCS collected in the name of a minor. With effect from 1 January 2025, the parent of a minor, in whose tax return the minor's income is included, will be allowed to avail oneself of the credit for the TCS deducted in the minor's name.
Interest at 1% per month or part of the month is levied on the employer in case of a delay in deduction. Interest at 1.5% per month or part of the month is levied in case there is a delay in deposition of the taxes so deducted.
## Black Money Taxation Act
The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 (the Black Money Taxation Act) covers all persons who were ROR in India, in accordance with provision of the Income-tax Act, either in the tax year to which the income relates or in the tax year in which the undisclosed asset located outside India was acquired. Any undisclosed foreign income or assets detected are to be taxed at the rate of 30% under the Black Money Taxation Act. Non-disclosure or inaccurate disclosure will attract a penalty of INR 1 million and may attract imprisonment of up to seven years. In addition, there is a provision for penalty of 300% of tax and imprisonment of up to ten years in case of wilful attempt to evade taxes on foreign income/assets.
With effect from 1 October 2024, a penalty will not be levied where an individual omits reporting assets (other than immovable property) valued at INR 2 million or less.
## Restriction on cash transactions
No person will receive an amount of INR 200,000 or more in (i) aggregate from a person in a day, (ii) respect of a single transaction, or (iii) respect of transactions relating to one event or occasion from a person. A person will have to transact for amounts above the prescribed limit by way of an account payee cheque or account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system through a bank account. The provision will not apply in case of:
  * Any receipt by the government, any banking company, post office savings bank, or cooperative bank.
  * Any other persons or class of persons or receipts that may be notified by the Central Government.


A penalty will be levied on a person who receives a sum in contravention of provisions, and the penalty will be equal to the amount of such receipt. However, the penalty will not be levied if the person proves that there were good and sufficient reasons for such contravention.
In order to further discourage cash transactions and move towards less cash economy, a new provision was inserted attracting a 2% tax deducted at source on cash payments in excess of INR 10 million in aggregate made during the year by a banking company or cooperative bank or post office to any person from an account maintained by the recipient. Effective 1 July 2020, in case a person who has not filed the return of income for three tax years immediately preceding the relevant tax year in which the withdrawals are made and for which the due date for filing the tax return has expired, tax will be deducted at 2% on withdrawals exceeding INR 2 million or 5% if such withdrawals exceed INR 10 million.
## Tax audit process
### Audit for income-tax purposes
Persons carrying on business are required to get their books of account audited for income-tax purposes if the business turnover exceeds INR 10 million. For individuals opting for the presumptive taxation scheme, one will not be required to get one’s accounts audited if the total turnover or gross receipts of the relevant previous year does not exceed INR 20 million. This has been effective from tax year 2017/18 onwards. For persons carrying on a profession, crossing the turnover threshold of INR 5 million will attract the requirement to have its books of accounts audited from 1 April 2017. The penalty for non-compliance with this audit requirement is INR 150,000, subject to 0.5% of total turnover/gross receipts.
### Special audit
Tax authorities, at any stage of proceedings, having regard to the nature, complexity, and volume of accounts or doubts on correctness of accounts or other reasons, may, after taking necessary approval of the Chief Commissioner, direct a taxpayer to get its accounts audited and to furnish the report.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations under the Income-tax Act for submission of tax returns (other than amended or updated tax returns) is nine months from the end of the relevant tax year, and for assessment of returns filed is 12 months (time limit to be increased by another 12 months in case transfer pricing provisions are applicable) from the end of the relevant tax year for which the return is filed. The statute of limitations for reassessment ranges from four to eleven years from the end of the relevant tax year.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
### Faceless assessment
With a view to roll out e-assessment across the country so as to impart greater transparency and accountability, the Central Government was empowered to notify a scheme for scrutiny assessments to achieve the desired purpose. The scope of e-assessment has been extended to include best judgement assessment and reassessment as well. Similar e-proceedings have been introduced in respect of:
  * Proceedings before Commissioner (Appeals).
  * Imposition of penalty under the Income-tax Act.


## General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
GAAR provisions were introduced by the Finance Act, 2017 and have been applicable since 1 April 2017. These provisions empower the tax department to declare an ‘arrangement’, or any part or step thereof, entered into by a taxpayer with the main purpose of obtaining tax benefit to be an 'Impermissible Avoidance Agreement' (IAA), the consequence of which would be denial of tax benefit under the Income-tax Act or under the applicable tax treaty.
For GAAR provisions, an IAA means the main purpose of which is to obtain a tax benefit, and it:
  * creates rights and obligations not at arm’s length
  * results in abuse/misuse of provisions of this Act (directly/indirectly)
  * lacks/is deemed to lack commercial substance, or
  * is carried out in a manner that is not ordinarily employed for _bona fide_ purposes.


The following are consequences if an arrangement is regarded as an IAA:
  * Disregard/re-characterise the arrangement.
  * Disregard corporate structure.
  * Deny tax treaty benefit.
  * Reassign place of residence/situs of assets or transactions.
  * Reallocate income, expenses, relief, etc.
  * Re-characterise equity-debt, income-expense, relief, etc.

## Treatment of business entities
An individual has various options for conducting business in India. An individual can opt for forming a proprietary concern, can be a partner in a partnership firm, can be a partner in a limited liability partnership, can create a limited liability partnership, can create and become a member of an association of persons, or can create and be part of a body of individuals. The tax law has different provisions for taxing and assessing different types of entities.
## Inter-Governmental Agreements (IGAs)
The government of India has signed an IGA with the United States (US) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in India. According to the IGA read with the FATCA provisions, foreign financial institutions in India are required to report tax information about US account holders to the Indian government which will, in turn, relay that information to the US Internal Revenue Service (US IRS). Further, the US IRS will provide similar information about Indian citizens having any accounts or assets in the United States. This automatic exchange of information has begun from 30 September 2015. Subsequent to the signing of the IGA, the Indian government enacted rules and prescribed forms relating to FATCA reporting in India.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
## Employment income
An individual’s entire remuneration/salary received from an employer for services rendered in India is taxable in India. Taxable income includes all amounts, whether in cash or in kind, arising from an office of employment.
Apart from the salary, fees, bonuses, and commissions, some of the most common remuneration items are allowances, reimbursement of personal expenses, education payment, and perquisites or benefits provided by the employer either free of cost or at concessional rate. All such payments are included, whether paid directly to employees or on their behalf.
Reimbursement of expenses actually incurred wholly, necessarily, and exclusively in the performance of official duties is not included in taxable salary. However, concessional treatment is accorded to housing benefit, car facility, and certain retirement benefits. Certain allowances and benefits paid or provided by an employer, like house rent allowance (instead of housing benefit) and leave travel allowance, are treated as exempt, subject to applicable conditions and limits, and are, accordingly, not included in the computation of income.
Employer’s contribution to a recognised provident fund of up to 12% of employee’s salary is tax exempt in the year of contribution.
Effective 1 April 2020, if the aggregate amount of an employer’s contribution to an approved superannuation fund, recognised provident fund, and national pension scheme exceeds INR 750,000, it will be taxable as perquisites in the hands of the employee. Further, annual accretions on such employer contributions by way of interest, dividend, or any other amount of a similar nature will also be taxed as perquisites in the hands of the employee. The Revenue Department has prescribed a formula for calculation of annual accretion as defined above.
Interest accrued on an individual’s own provident fund contribution made in excess of INR 250,000 from tax year 2021/22 onwards is to be taxable. In August 2021, the Revenue Department prescribed rules that describe the detailed steps of calculating the taxable amount in respect of interest accrued on an employee’s contribution in the provident fund account exceeding INR 250,000 (INR 500,000 if there is no employer contribution), effective FY 2021/22. The provident fund authorities are required to maintain separate accounts for ‘taxable’ and ‘non-taxable’ contributions made by the employee. Interest accrued in the ‘non-taxable’ account will not be subject to tax, and interest accrued on the ‘taxable’ account will be subject to tax.
An employee holding a foreign passport and employed by a foreign enterprise, who is not present in India for more than 90 days in a tax year, is not taxed on remuneration received from the foreign employer for services performed in India, provided the foreign enterprise is not engaged in any trade or business in India, and the remuneration is not deductible in computing the employer’s taxable income in India. The tax treaties entered into by India also provide short stay exemption wherein the 90-days period (_as discussed above_) is replaced by 183 days and two other conditions (i.e. remuneration received from an employer who is not a resident of India and where the salary is not borne by a permanent establishment of the overseas employer in India are provided on similar lines in many cases). The benefit under the tax treaty is extended to all individuals, including foreign citizens.
## Equity compensation
Value of any specified security or sweat equity shares allotted or transferred directly or indirectly by the employer or former employer, free of cost or at a concessional rate, is taxable as perquisite in the hands of the employee. The valuation for this purpose is to be done on the basis of the FMV of the specified security or sweat equity share on the date when the option is exercised (i.e. allotment) by the employee as reduced by the amount recovered from the employee.
As per the income-tax rules, FMV will be the average of the opening price and closing price of the share on the date of exercise by the employee on the recognised stock exchange of India on which such shares are listed. In cases where the shares are listed on more than one recognised stock exchange of India, then FMV will be the average of the opening price and closing price of the share on the date of exercise by the employee on the recognised stock exchange that records the highest volume of trading in the share on such date.
Further, in cases where there was no trading on the said date, then such FMV on the closest date, immediately preceding the date of exercise, will be considered. In cases where the shares are not listed on the recognised stock exchange in India, the FMV is to be determined by a Category I merchant banker in India registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The merchant banker valuation will be the date of exercise or a date earlier than the date of exercise of the option, but not being a date that is more than 180 days earlier than the date of exercise.
Further, in case of sale of shares by the employees, capital gains may arise and the same will be taxable in the hands of the employees. The taxes on capital gains have to be paid by the employees depending on the residential status in the relevant tax year.
Effective 1 April 2020, taxation of any specified security or sweat equity shares that is taxable as perquisite in the hands of employees of eligible start-ups has been deferred. The tax is now required to be deducted/paid within 14 days from the earliest of the following events:
  * Expiry of five years from the end of the tax year in which such security is allotted.
  * Date of sale of specified securities.
  * Date when employee ceases to be in employment with the start-up.


This relaxation has been provided to ease the burden of cash outflow on employees of such start-ups arising at the time of exercise of such securities.
## Income from business or profession
Profits and gains from a business or profession carried out by an individual are taxable in India, subject to certain deductions and allowance of depreciation and business expenses.
The following income,  _inter alia,_ is taxable in the hands of an individual:
  * Profits and gains of any business or profession carried on by the taxpayer at any time during the tax year.
  * Any interest, salary, bonus, commission, or remuneration, by whatever name called, due to, or received by, a partner of a firm from such firm. This would be deductible in the firm’s hands.


Note that the share of profit from a partnership firm is not taxed in the hands of the partner since it is paid out of the post-tax profits of the partnership firm.
### Presumptive taxation scheme for persons having income from a profession (other than business income)
Income of a taxpayer who is engaged in a specified profession, such as legal, medical, engineering, or architectural profession or the profession of accountancy or technical consultancy or interior decoration or any other profession, and whose total gross receipts does not exceed INR 5 million in a tax year (effective from tax year 2024/25, such limit will be enhanced to INR 7.5 million if at least 95% of the receipts are through online mode) is estimated at a sum equal to 50% of the total gross receipts. In other words, if the total turnover or gross receipt of the profession exceeds INR 5 million, then the scheme cannot be adopted. The scheme will apply to such resident taxpayer who is an individual, HUF, or partnership firm, but not a limited liability partnership firm. Under this scheme, the taxpayer will be deemed to have been allowed all the business expenses that he/she is otherwise eligible to claim. The taxpayer is not required to maintain books of accounts and get them audited unless the taxpayer claims profits and gains from the aforesaid profession are lower than the profits and gains deemed to be his/her income and the taxpayer’s income exceeds the maximum amount that is not chargeable to income-tax.
## Capital gains
_Refer to Capital gains taxes in the section for a description of the treatment of capital gains_.
## Dividend income
Previously, dividend income received from an Indian company was not taxable in the hands of the shareholder if dividend distribution tax (DDT) had been paid on the same by the company. This was applicable to resident as well as NR shareholders.
However, dividend income in excess of INR 1 million was chargeable to tax in the case of an individual, HUF, or a firm that is a resident in India at the rate of 10%. Also, dividend income received from an SEBI-registered Indian mutual fund was not taxable in the hands of recipient. This applied to resident as well as NR shareholders.
Effective 1 April 2020, dividend will now be taxed in the hands of the shareholders or unit holders at the applicable rates, and, correspondingly, the domestic company or mutual fund will not be required to pay any tax on distribution of income.
## Interest income
Interest income is taxable in India. A deduction of up to INR 10,000 is allowed in respect of savings bank interest on deposits (not being time deposits) with specified banking companies registered with the banking authority/cooperative societies engaged in carrying on business of banking/post office in India.
Further, the exemption limit on interest income for resident senior citizens is INR 50,000. Interest income will also include interest earned from fixed deposits and recurring deposits.
## Rental income
Any income earned from the letting-out, or renting, of any building, or land appurtenant thereto, is taxable as ‘income from house property’ in the hands of the individual. The tax is levied on the annual value of the property computed in terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act. Deduction of municipal taxes paid during the year (irrespective of the year to which the expense pertains) and a standard deduction at the rate of 30% is available on the gross annual value while computing the ‘income from house property’.
If an individual owns two or more house properties for his/her use, then such individual may exercise an option to treat any two house properties as self-occupied. The remaining house property(ies), if any, are deemed to be let-out, and a notional rent as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act is computed as the taxable income under the head ‘income from house property’. In other words, the third house property is treated as let-out and an expected rental income is treated as taxable income.
The amount of rent received in arrears or the amount of unrealised rent realised subsequently by a taxpayer will be charged to income-tax in the tax year in which such rent is received or realised, whether the taxpayer is the owner of the property or not in that tax year. 30% of the arrears of rent or the unrealised rent received/realised subsequently by the taxpayer will be allowed as a deduction. There are separate property taxes levied as per municipal tax laws, apart from income tax on rental income (see the section for more information).
### Deduction on housing loan interest
Income from house property will be reduced by the amount of interest paid on borrowed capital where the loan has been taken for the purpose of purchase/construction/repair/renewal/reconstruction of the residential house property. However, no deduction will be allowed unless the individual furnishes a certificate from the person to whom the interest is payable on the capital borrowed, specifying the amount of interest payable by the taxpayer for the purpose of such acquisition or construction, etc. of the property.
Unlike the deduction on property taxes or principal repayment of home loan, which are available on actual payment basis, the deduction on interest is available on accrual basis (i.e. it is immaterial whether the interest has been actually paid or not during the year). Charges like service fee or other charge in respect of the loan amount related to the housing loan is eligible to be included in interest and qualifies for tax deduction.
Deduction on housing loan can be claimed once the construction is completed and possession of the property has been obtained. The law provides a deferred deduction on the interest payable during pre-construction period (i.e. period prior to the tax year in which the property has been acquired or constructed). The deduction on such interest is available equally over a period of five tax years starting from the year acquired/constructed.
### Maximum limit of deduction of interest
In case the house property is not let out during the year, the maximum amount of interest that can be claimed as deduction is limited to INR 200,000, subject to conditions that the loan is taken on or after 1 April 1999 for the purpose of purchase or construction and such property is acquired or constructed within five years from the end of year in which loan is taken. For all other cases, where the house property is not let out, the maximum amount that can be claimed as deduction is limited to INR 30,000.
In case a house property is let out during the tax year (including deemed to be let out), there is no restriction on the maximum amount of interest that can be claimed as deduction.
### Interest in excess of taxable rental income
Individuals, subsequent to claiming deduction of interest as per the above-mentioned prescribed limits, can set off loss under the head house property (due to claim of excess interest) from any other head of income up to a maximum of INR 200,000. Any unabsorbed loss under the head of house property will be carried forward for the next eight tax years and will be eligible to be set off against the income from house property only.
To incentivise first-time home buyers availing home loans during the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022, an additional interest deduction of up to INR 150,000 will be available, provided stamp duty value of the property does not exceed INR 4.5 million and other prescribed conditions are met. 
## Exempt income
Certain income is eligible to be claimed as exempt from taxable income. The exemption can be based on income or investment. Some of them are detailed below:
  * Income source based: 
    * Tax holiday of profits of business engaged in infrastructure development or development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
    * Agricultural income.
  * Investment based: 
    * Income arising from investment in certain mutual funds, infrastructure bonds, investment in government securities, etc.

# India
## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 25 October 2024
Taxation of individuals in India is primarily based on their residential status in the relevant tax year. _See the section for a description of the types of residential status envisaged for an individual_.
An individual is said to be a resident in the tax year if he/she is:
  * physically present in India for a period of 182 days or more in the tax year (182-day rule), or
  * physically present in India for a period of 60* days or more during the relevant tax year and 365 days or more in aggregate in four preceding tax years (60-day rule).


If none of the above two conditions are met, the individual is said to be an NR in that tax year.
Example:
  * If Mr. A comes to India on or before 30 September, he will be treated as resident for that tax year.
  * If Mr. B comes to India on or before 31 January and has stayed in India for 365 days or more during the four tax years preceding the relevant tax year, he will be treated as resident for that tax year.


A resident individual is treated as RNOR if he/she satisfies any one of the following conditions:
  * He/she has been an NR in nine out of ten tax years preceding the tax year for which residential status is being determined.
  * His/her physical presence in India is less than or equal to 729 days during seven tax years preceding the tax year for which residential status is being determined.


A resident individual not satisfying both of the above conditions is treated as ROR.
Example:
If an expatriate stays in India for 300 days for each of three tax years, then he/she will not qualify as RNOR in the fourth year because of the following reasons:
  * He/she is not an NR in nine out of ten tax years.
  * His/her physical presence in India exceeds 729 days in the preceding seven tax years.


In determining the physical presence of individuals in India, it is not essential that their stay in the country needs to be continuous or at the same place.
Furthermore, their date of arrival in India and date of departure from it may be considered as their period of stay in the country. The purpose of their residence in India is irrelevant, and even if it is for a visit to their families or tourism, it is counted as a stay in India for residency purposes.
In effect, a newcomer to India normally remains an NR/RNOR for the first two to three tax years of stay in India.
*The rules are slightly more liberal for a person who is of Indian origin or an Indian citizen residing abroad and visiting India, or who is an Indian citizen and leaves India for employment abroad.
  * An Indian citizen who leaves India as a member of the crew of an Indian ship or for taking employment abroad will qualify as a resident of India only if physically present in India for 182 days or more during that tax year.
  * An Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin having taxable India-sourced income not exceeding INR 1.5 million and who, being outside India, comes on a visit to India will qualify as a resident of India only if physically present in India for 182 days or more during that tax year.


Effective 1 April 2020, an Indian citizen or person of India origin who, being outside India, comes on a visit to India and whose India-sourced taxable income exceeds INR 1.5 million during the relevant tax year will qualify as a resident of India only if physically present in India for 120 days or more during that tax year and 365 days or more during the previous four tax years immediately preceding the relevant tax year. Further, such an individual will qualify as RNOR if the total stay in India during the relevant tax year is 120 days or more but less than 182 days.
## Deemed resident
An Indian citizen having India-sourced taxable income exceeding INR 1.5 million during the relevant tax year will be deemed to be a resident of India if one is not liable to tax in any other country by reason of domicile or residence or any other criteria of similar nature. Further, such an individual will qualify as RNOR in India for the relevant tax year.
The above rule of determining a person as a 'deemed resident' of India will only be applicable where the normal rule of residency based on the individual's physical presence in India during the relevant previous year and/or past four tax years is not applicable.
For the purpose of residency in India, the expression 'India-sourced taxable income' will include income deemed to accrue or arise in India.
To provide more clarity on the applicability of this provision, the definition of the term 'liable to tax' is introduced, which means that there is a liability of tax on the person under any law for the time being in force in any country and also includes cases where, subsequent to imposition of tax liability, an exemption has been provided.

## Individual - Other taxes

## Social security contributions
Indian social security is broadly governed by the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (PF Act) and schemes made thereunder, namely the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme (EPF) and the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS). The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), a statutory body established by the government of India, administers social security regulations in India.
Currently, Indian social security regulations apply mandatorily to an establishment in India employing 20 or more persons or where an establishment voluntarily seeks registration with the authorities. Employees (including foreign nationals) working with an establishment in India to which the PF Act applies are liable to contribute towards the provident fund at the fixed rate of 12% of salary. The employer is required to make the matching contribution and deposit both the employer’s and employee’s contributions (i.e. 24%) to the provident fund of the employee by the 15th day of the following month.
Out of the employer’s contribution of 12%, an amount equal to 8.33% of salary (salary capped at INR 15,000 per month in respect of Indian employees) is allocated to the pension fund of the employee.
### International worker
The government of India made the social security scheme mandatory for cross-border workers. A foreign national qualifies as an ‘international worker’ if he/she is coming to work for an establishment in India to which the PF Act applies.
Similarly, an Indian national qualifies as an ‘international worker’ if he/she has worked or is going to work in a country with which India has entered into a social security agreement (SSA) and is eligible to avail benefits under the social security program of the host country, according to the terms of the relevant SSA. However, it has been clarified that Indian employees holding a certificate of coverage (COC)/detachment certificate, obtained from Indian social security authorities and contributing to the Indian social security schemes, will not become international workers and will continue to be treated like any other domestic Indian employees. Also, Indian employees qualifying as international workers on account of working/having worked in a country with which India has an SSA will re-acquire the status of Indian employees upon repatriation to India after completion of overseas assignment. Accordingly, such employees will not be subject to the special provisions applicable to international workers after repatriating to India.
### Exemption
An international worker from a country with which India has an SSA in force is exempted from Indian social security where he or she:
  * is contributing to his/her home country’s social security, either as a citizen or resident, and
  * enjoys the status of ‘detached worker’ for the period, and according to the terms, specified in the relevant SSA.


Similarly, an international worker from a country with which India has entered into a bilateral comprehensive economic agreement prior to 1 October 2008 is exempted from Indian social security where:
  * he or she is contributing to his/her home country’s social security, either as a citizen or resident, and
  * the agreement specifically exempts natural persons of the other contracting country from contributing to the social security system of India.


To amend and consolidate a majority of Indian labour laws, the following four labour codes have been passed by the Parliament of India, which subsumes and amalgamates 29 different central labour laws legislations:
  * The Code for Social Security, 2020.
  * The Code on Wages, 2019.
  * The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020.
  * The Industrial Relations Code, 2020.


There are several changes, ranging from reclassification of workforce to changes in the definition of salary for employees’ benefit and other matters. 
The Ministry of Labour and Employment of India has deferred the implementation of the above four codes. 
### Other issues
  * In case of Unit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs) issued on or after 1 February 2021, tax exemption on proceeds received from such ULIPs is not available if aggregate premium payable for any tax year exceeds INR 250,000. Such proceeds are to be taxed as capital gains from equity-oriented funds and to be subjected to securities transaction tax (STT). Proceeds received upon death will continue to be exempt from tax.
  * Effective 1 April 2023, income from insurance policies (other than ULIP, for which provisions already exists) having premium or aggregate of premium above INR 500,000 in a year would be taxed. However, income is proposed to be exempt if received on the death of the insured person. This income will be taxable under the heading 'income from other sources'. A deduction will be allowed for the premium paid if such premium has not been claimed as a deduction earlier.
  * Currently, due to mismatch in timing of taxing withdrawals from overseas retirement funds, certain tax residents face hardship from double taxation in situations where such individuals contributed to the retirement benefit fund outside India while they were non-resident in India and resident in that foreign country. Rules for providing relief due to mismatch in timing of taxation of such retirement benefits are yet to be prescribed.


## Goods and services tax (GST)
GST is an indirect tax, which is a transaction-based taxation regime, that has been in effect in India since 1 July 2017. The rate of GST varies from 5% to 28% depending upon the category of goods and services, the general rate of tax being 18%. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Wealth taxes
There are no wealth taxes in India.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
There is no inheritance tax in India.
There is no gift tax liability on the donor. However, any sum of money aggregating to INR 50,000 or more received during the relevant tax year without consideration or for an inadequate consideration by an individual from any person not being a relative (see below for details) is subject to income tax in the hands of the recipient.
Similarly, the following receipts are also subject to tax:
  * Any specified movable property/sum of money received without consideration, the FMV of which exceeds INR 50,000: Total amount is taxable.
  * Any specified movable property received for a consideration less than FMV, where the difference between the FMV and consideration is more than INR 50,000: Such difference is taxable.
  * Any immovable property received without consideration, the stamp duty value of which exceeds INR 50,000: Total amount of stamp duty value is taxable.
  * Any immovable property received for a consideration less than stamp duty value, where the difference between the stamp duty value and consideration is more than the higher of INR 50,000 and 10% of the consideration: Such difference is taxable. Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat 3.0 package, the above limit of 10% has been increased to 20% till 30 June 2021 for the primary sale of residential properties valued up to INR 20 million.
  * The above receipts are not considered as taxable if the same is/are received from any relative, i.e.: 
    * brother
    * sister
    * brother or sister of the spouse
    * brother or sister of either of the parents of the individual
    * any lineal ascendants/descendants of the individual or spouse of the individual, and
    * spouse of individual or of any of the above.


Further, the same are not considered as taxable if received at the time of marriage, under a will/inheritance, in contemplation of death of the payer, or through any other criteria specified in the law.
## Property taxes
Property tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The rate of tax levied varies from city to city in India and is generally related to the prevailing market prices for property in each locality.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains from the disposal of capital assets are liable to tax in the tax year in which such assets are sold or transferred. Capital assets include all forms of property, stocks and shares, land and buildings, goodwill, etc. (but exclude personal effects except stock-in-trade, stores, and raw materials held for business purposes). Jewellery also forms part of capital assets.
### Categorising capital gains
Earlier capital assets held for more than 36 months (12 months in the case of securities [other than units] listed on a recognised stock exchange in India, units of the Unit Trust of India, units of equity-oriented mutual funds, and zero-coupon bonds; 24 months for immovable property or unlisted shares) are termed as ‘long-term capital assets’, and the assets not so held are called ‘short-term capital assets’. However, from 23 July 2024, capital assets held for more than 24 months immediately preceding the date of its transfer (12 months in the case of securities (including units) listed on a recognised stock exchange in India, units of the Unit Trust of India, units of equity-oriented mutual funds, and zero-coupon bonds) will be termed as ‘long-term capital assets’.
Capital gains arising from the transfer/disposal of long-term capital assets are called 'long-term capital gains'. Gains arising from the disposal of short-term capital assets are called 'short-term capital gains'. This distinction is important as long-term capital gains are taxed or treated beneficially and there are also planning opportunities to save taxes provided the consideration or gain is re-invested, subject to fulfilment of certain other conditions.
Long-term capital gains are subject to tax at prescribed beneficial rates (plus applicable surcharge and health and education cess). Short-term capital gains are added to the taxable income of the individual and subject to tax at normal slab rates.
### Computation of long-term capital gains
Except in case of debentures and bonds (other than capital indexed bonds issued by Government/Sovereign Gold Bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India), the cost of acquisition of long-term capital assets is determined after indexing costs by a prescribed inflation factor (known as ‘indexed cost of acquisition’). The base year for computation of indexed cost of acquisition is 2001. Assets acquired before 1 April 2001 can be taken at actual cost or FMV as on 1 April 2001 at the option of the taxpayer. However, effective 1 April 2020, in case of capital asset being land or building or both, the FMV of such asset on 1 April 2001 will not exceed the stamp duty value, wherever applicable, of such asset as on 1 April 2001.
In case of an NR where shares or debentures of an Indian company are purchased by utilising foreign currency, the subsequent capital gains are determined by computing the gains in the same foreign currency in which it was purchased and reconverting the gains into Indian rupees to calculate the tax payable on the same.
However, there are a few exceptions for indexation and rate of tax on long-term capital gains/short-term capital gains:
  * Effective 1 April 2018, long-term capital gains arising on transfer of equity shares in a company or a unit of equity oriented mutual fund or a unit of business trust (on which STT has been paid) will be taxable at the rate of 10% (without any indexation benefit). However, there is no tax on capital gains up to INR 100,000.


For transfer/disposal of capital assets on or after 23 July 2024, the rate of tax has been increased to 12.5% and the non-taxable amount has been increased to INR 125,000.
For transaction of sale effective 1 April 2018 in respect of above-mentioned capital assets already held from a date prior to 31 January 2018, the cost of acquisition would be determined as the higher of the following:
  *     * Actual cost of acquisition.
    * The lower of the following: 
      * FMV as of 31 January 2018.
      * The full value of consideration arising on transfer.


  * Tax on long-term capital gains (arising to any person) on transfer of securities (other than units) listed on a recognised stock exchange in India or a zero-coupon bond is computed at the lower of 10% on gains computed without indexation or 20% of gains computed with indexation (if applicable). However, the same has been done away with in case of sale of such capital assets on or after 23 July 2024. In case of an NR, if the securities or shares of a company, not being a company in which the public are substantially interested, are not listed on an Indian recognised stock exchange, the tax on corresponding long-term capital gains is computed at 10% (without indexation and without the benefit of foreign exchange fluctuation). For transfer/disposal of such capital assets on or after 23 July 2024, the rate of tax has been increased to 12.5%.
  * Income on the transfer, redemption, or maturity of ‘unlisted debentures’ or ‘unlisted bonds’ on or after 23 July 2024 is to be deemed as ‘short-term capital gains’.
  * In the case of an individual or an HUF, the long-term capital gains arising on the transfer of immovable property (i.e. land and building or both) acquired before 23 July 2024 are to be taxed either at 12.5% (without the benefit of indexation) or 20% (with the benefit of indexation), whichever is beneficial to the taxpayer.
  * Short-term capital gains earned on equity shares and equity oriented mutual funds and a unit of business trust that are listed on a recognised stock exchange in India are taxable at 15%, provided STT has been paid on sale. For transfers/disposals on or after 23 July 2024, such rate has been increased to 20%.


The surcharge rate of 25%/37% will not apply to capital gains arising on sale of equity share of a listed company or a unit of an equity oriented mutual fund or unit of business trust. The enhanced surcharge rates of 25%/37% will also not apply to the income of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) arising from securities prescribed under the Income-tax Act.
Moreover, on income arising on account of long-term capital gains on all the capital assets, the rate of surcharge will be 15%.
For NRs, the basic exemption limit of INR 250,000 does not apply against the gains earned on sale of such shares/units.
Tax liability on long-term capital gains can be reduced by taking benefit of exemptions provided in the Income-tax Act when gains/sale proceeds from the sale of the capital assets are reinvested into house property and/or prescribed investments. Effective 1 April 2023, benefit claimed on long-term capital gains arising from transfer of capital asset where gains are re-invested in a residential house has been restricted to INR 100 million.
Short-term capital losses can be offset against any capital gains (long-term or short-term). Long-term capital loss can only be offset against long-term capital gains. Unabsorbed capital losses (short-term or long-term) can be carried forward for a maximum of eight years to be offset only against future capital gains as mentioned above.
To raise funds for the Start-up Action Plan, the government has provided an exemption from long-term capital gains on the sale of any long-term capital asset if the sale consideration is invested in units of a specified fund. The specified fund will be notified by the Central Government in due course, and the maximum deduction available will be INR 5 million. The investments should be held for a minimum period of three years to avail the exemption.
Effective 1 April 2019, a once in a lifetime option has been given to an individual/HUF wherein long-term capital gains (up to INR 20 million) arising from transfer of a residential property can now be reinvested in two house properties in India. Further, an individual/HUF selling a residential property also has the option to reinvest the long-term capital gains by subscribing to shares of a company that qualifies as a small or medium enterprise and in shares of eligible start-ups with no cap on reinvestment of the capital gain. Investments under this provision can be made up to 31 March 2022. In case the eligible start-up is a technology driven start-up, it will be entitled to utilise the proceeds of such equity shares in computers or computer software.
On account of transaction in immovable property, any income earned is either taxed under income from capital gains or income from other sources. The income is taxed on the basis of the sale consideration or stamp duty value, whichever is higher. In case the sale consideration is less than the stamp duty value, the differential is taxed as income from other sources. However, effective 1 April 2020, in case of sale, no such adjustments will be made in cases where the difference between stamp duty value and sale consideration is not more than 10% of such sale consideration. In case of purchase, if the variation between stamp duty value and sale consideration does not exceed INR 50,000 or 10% of sale consideration, no addition is to be made to total income.
The above limit has been enhanced from 10% to 20% in relation to immovable property acquired during the period 12 November 2020 to 30 June 2021 by way of first-time allotment from a real estate developer for a consideration up to INR 20 million.
## Securities transaction tax (STT)
STT is applicable to transactions involving purchase/sale of equity shares, derivatives, units of equity-oriented funds through a recognised stock exchange, or purchase/sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to any mutual fund. The STT leviable for such transactions varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based.
## Buyback of shares
An additional tax is payable on transactions involving buyback of shares by Indian companies from its shareholders. A tax at 20% (plus surcharge at 12% and health and education cess at 4%) is payable by the company on the difference of consideration paid on buyback and the issue price of shares. The Revenue Department has prescribed the methodology for determination of amount received for issue of shares under different situations, being a subject matter of tax on buyback. The buyback consideration received will be tax exempt in the hands of the receiver. No tax credit will be allowed in case of such taxes paid either to the company or to the shareholder.
With effect from 1 October 2024, consideration received under buyback is proposed to be taxed as deemed dividend in the hands of the shareholders. Moreover, no deduction for expenses shall be available to the shareholder against such deemed dividend. Additionally, the amount originally invested in the shares being bought back would be available as a capital loss and shall be available for set-off against the future capital gain from sale of shares or otherwise.
