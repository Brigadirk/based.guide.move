No tax returns, forms, or procedures are required to be completed for tax compliance purposes in the Cayman Islands.
Note that Cayman paying agents making interest payments to individuals who are tax resident in an EU member state may have to report interest paid under the terms of the Reporting of Savings Income Information Law. The Cayman Tax Information Authority facilitates receipt/submission of such reports of information.
