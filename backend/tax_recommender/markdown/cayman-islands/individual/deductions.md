## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 29 November 2024
Since no income taxes are imposed on individuals in the Cayman Islands, deductions from income are not relevant in the context of Cayman Islands taxation.
Note that Cayman paying agents making interest payments to individuals who are tax resident in an EU member state may have to report interest paid under the terms of the Reporting of Savings Income Information Law.
