## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 21 July 2024
There is no individual income tax scheme in Saudi Arabia.
Income tax is not imposed on an individual's earnings if they are derived only from employment in Saudi Arabia.
Non-employment income is taxed as an entity or permanent establishment (PE). _See in the Corporate summary for more information on the taxation of non-employment income_.
A non-resident person with no PE who derives income from a source in Saudi Arabia is taxed based on the withholding tax (WHT) regulations. _See in the Corporate summary for more information on WHT regulations_.
