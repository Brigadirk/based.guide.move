## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT (locally termed as ‘sales tax’) is ordinarily levied at 18% on the value of goods, unless specifically exempt or subject to sales tax at a reduced rate, after allowing related input credits.
Sales tax on services is levied by the Provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, within their jurisdictions, at rates ranging from 15% to 16%. Reduced rates have been prescribed for certain specific services. Input tax adjustment is generally not allowed in case of a reduced rate.
Sales tax paid on services, federal sales tax on goods, and federal excise duty are adjustable against each other, with a few exceptions.
Supplies made by certain specific persons/sectors are subject to specific sales tax regimes (e.g. retail price/fixed tax regime) or otherwise subject to reduced rates of sales tax.
Commercial import of goods is subject to VAT at 3%, in addition to the sales tax payable at the standard rate at the import stage. Further tax of 4% is applicable in case of supplies to inactive taxpayers, subject to certain conditions.
