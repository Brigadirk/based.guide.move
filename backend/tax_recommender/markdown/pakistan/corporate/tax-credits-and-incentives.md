## Small companies
Activities of small companies are encouraged with a reduced income tax rate of 20% (_see the section_).
A small company has been defined to mean a company that:
  * is registered on or after 1 July 2005 under the Companies Act, 2017
  * has a paid-up capital plus undistributed reserves not exceeding PKR 50 million
  * has employees not exceeding 250 at any time during the year
  * has an annual turnover not exceeding PKR 250 million, and
  * is not formed by splitting up or the reconstitution of business already in existence.


## Charitable donations credit
Companies are allowed a tax credit equivalent to 20% of their taxable income in respect of donations to:
  * any board of education or university in Pakistan, established by or under federal or provincial law
  * any educational institution, hospital, or relief fund established or run in Pakistan by federal government, provincial government, or local government, and
  * any non-profit organisation.


Companies were earlier allowed a straight deduction against taxable income (up to 20% of taxable income) in case of donations made to certain approved institutions. Donations to these charitable institutes earlier eligible for direct deduction from income have now been transposed into the tax credit regime. As a result, the overall upper limit for tax break for the donors, in respect of charitable donations, has been reduced.
## Foreign tax credit
Where a resident taxpayer derives foreign-source income on which foreign income tax is paid within two years from the year in which it is derived, the taxpayer is allowed a tax credit equal to the lower of (i) the foreign income tax paid or (ii) the Pakistan tax payable in respect of that income. However, foreign tax paid is not refundable.
