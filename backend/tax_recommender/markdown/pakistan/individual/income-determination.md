Taxable income is calculated under five different types of income, as follows:
  * Salary.
  * Property.
  * Business.
  * Capital gains.
  * Income from other sources, which includes income from dividends, royalties, profit on debt (interest), ground rent, sub-lease of land or building, lease of building inclusive of plant or machinery, prize money, winnings, etc.


## Employment income
Employee’s gross salary is Pakistan-source income and taxable in Pakistan if it is earned from employment exercised in Pakistan or if it is paid by or on behalf of the federal government, a provincial government, or a local authority.
Salary is the amount received by an employee from employment. It includes leave pay, payment in lieu of leave, overtime, bonuses, commissions, fees, gratuities, work condition supplements, monetary and non-monetary perquisites, any allowances, including those paid on a fixed basis or not exclusively spent on behalf of the employer, profits in lieu of or in addition to salary, pensions, annuities, and tax reimbursement. In addition, amounts or perquisites paid or provided by an associate of the employer, a third-party under an arrangement with the employer or associate of the employer, a past employer or a prospective employer, or payments to an associate of the employee are also to be considered as salary.
_The extent of taxability and exclusions from income of some perquisites are discussed in the_ _section_.
## Equity compensation
### Employee share scheme
The fair market value of the shares determined at the date of issue under an employee share scheme, including as a result of the exercise of an option or right to acquire the shares, as reduced by any consideration paid by the employee for the shares, shall be chargeable to tax as salary. However, where shares are issued to the employee subject to restriction on the transfer of such shares, no amount shall be included in salary of the employee until the earlier of the time the employee has a free right to transfer the shares or at the time when the employee disposes of the shares.
The value of the right or option to acquired shares under an employee share scheme is not chargeable to tax
### Stock options
An employee is taxed on the exercise of an option on the fair market value of the shares as reduced by the cost to the employee on acquisition. The gain on sale is taxed in the year of disposal, considering the fair market value at the time of exercise of the option as a cost of the employee.
## Foreign-source income of returning expatriates
Foreign-source income of returning expatriates (citizens of Pakistan who were not resident in Pakistan during any of the preceding four tax years) shall be exempt from tax in the tax year of return and the succeeding tax year.
## Income from property
Income from property for all taxpayers has been made subject to uniform taxation on a net income basis at the applicable rates. This means that the separate block rates for chargeability of tax on property income of individuals or AOPs are no longer applicable. In the case that rental income is computed on a net income basis, certain specific deductions are allowed, including expenditure for the purpose of administration and collection charges (up to a threshold of 4% of gross receipts).
WHT rates applicable in case of payment of rent of immovable property to individuals or AOPs are:
Taxable income (PKR) | Tax on column 1 (PKR) | Tax on excess (%)  
---|---|---  
Over (column 1) | Not over  
0 | 300,000 | 0  
300,000 | 600,000 | 5  
600,000 | 2,000,000 | 15,000 | 10  
2,000,000 | 155,000 | 25  
These WHT rates shall increase by 100% in case the recipient of rental income is not an active taxpayer.
All payments made on account of rent of immovable properties shall be subject to the above WHT rates (if made to an individual or AOP), including in case of sub-lease.
Loss sustain under any heading of income is allowed to be set off against the person’s income under this heading.
## Capital gains
Capital gains on the sale, exchange, or transfer of movable capital assets, except for securities traded at a stock exchange, are taxable at normal slab rates prescribed for individuals. Capital gain arising on these capital assets held for more than one year, which was earlier taxable to the extent of 75% of the total gain, is now fully taxable.
### Capital gain on immovable properties
The gain arising on the disposal of immovable property shall be computed as the consideration received on disposal of the asset less the cost of the asset and is subject to tax as follows:
#### Properties acquired on or after 1 July 2024
  * For individuals and AOPs appearing on the Active Taxpayers’ List on date of disposal of property, the rate of tax is 15%.
  * For individuals and AOPs not appearing on the Active Taxpayers’ List on date of disposal of property, the personal income tax rates are applicable  _(__as specified in the section_ _)__,_ provided that the rate of tax shall not be less than 15%.


#### Properties acquired on or before 30 June 2024
Capital gains continue to be taxed at the applicable following slab rate on the basis of the respective holding period:
Holding period | Tax (%)

Where the holding period does not exceed one year | 15.0 | 15.0 | 15.0  
Where the holding period exceeds one year but does not exceed two years | 12.5 | 10.0 | 7.5  
Where the holding period exceeds two years but does not exceed three years | 10.0 | 7.5 | 0  
Where the holding period exceeds three years but does not exceed four years | 7.5 | 5.0 | 0  
Where the holding period exceeds four years but does not exceed five years | 5.0 | 0 | 0  
Where the holding period exceeds five years but does not exceed six years | 2.5 | 0 | 0  
Where the holding period exceeds six years | 0 | 0 | 0  
Capital gains relating to disposal of immovable properties situated outside Pakistan will be taxed at applicable slab rates irrespective of holding period.
Purchase of immovable property exceeding PKR 5 million and any other asset exceeding PKR 1 million by way of other than a banking channel shall not be considered as an eligible cost for the purpose of computation of capital gain, and the related asset shall not be considered as an eligible depreciable asset. Moreover, such action would also invite penal consequences for the purchaser. 
Purchase, sale, and transfer of immovable property is subject to advance tax at rates ranging from 3% to 4%, depending upon the gross consideration/fair market price of the immovable property. These rates are subject to increase in case buyer or seller are late filers / non-active taxpayers.
### Capital gain on securities

  * For individuals or AOPs appearing on the Active Taxpayers’ List on date of acquisition and disposal of securities, the rate of tax is 15%.
  * For individuals or AOPs not appearing on the Active Taxpayers’ List on date of acquisition and disposal of securities, the personal income tax rates are applicable  _(__as specified in the section_ _)__,_ provided that the rate of tax shall not be less than 15%.


For securities acquired during the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2024 (both dates are inclusive), the capital gain continues to be taxed at the applicable following slab rate on the basis of the respective holding period:

A mutual fund, collective investment scheme, or real estate investment trust (REIT) scheme shall, at redemption of securities, deduct capital gain tax at a rate of 15% for stock funds in case of individual / AOP or a company. However, the rate shall be 25% for other funds in case of a company. In case of stock funds, if dividend receipts of the fund are less than capital gains, the rate of deduction shall be 15%. No tax shall be deducted if the holding period of a security is more than six years.
Loss on disposal of listed and other securities could earlier only be set off against capital gains (and not allowed to be carried forward). From tax year 2019 and onwards, such loss is now allowed to be carried forward and set off against future capital gains on such securities, up to a maximum of three tax years.

Foreign companies (not having PE in Pakistan) and non-resident individuals investing in Pakistan in debt instruments and government securities through SCRAs and RDAs are subject to a blanket 10% WHT rate on capital gain arising on disposal of these debt instruments and government securities. This deduction shall be full and final discharge of their tax liability.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from a company (including mutual funds and real estate investment trusts [REITs], etc.) is generally subject to final tax at the rate of 15%; however, a different rate would apply in the following cases:
  * Dividend paid by Independent Power Producers (IPPs) where such dividend is a pass-through item under relevant energy agreements and is required to be reimbursed by the relevant agency at 7.5% (applicable WHT rate also 7.5%).
  * Dividend from a company where no tax is payable by such company, due to exemption of income or carry forward of business losses or claim of tax credits at 25% (applicable WHT rate also 25%).
  * Dividend received by a REIT scheme from a special purpose vehicle (SPV; as defined under Real Estate Investment Trust Regulations, 2015) at 0% (applicable WHT rate also 0%).
