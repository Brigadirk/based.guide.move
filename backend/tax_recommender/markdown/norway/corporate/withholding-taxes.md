## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 14 January 2025
Norway imposes WHT on dividends paid to foreign shareholders. The internal WHT rate on dividends is 25%, which may either be reduced under the exemption rule or by an applicable tax treaty. To qualify for the exemption rule, the recipient of the dividends has to be a corporate investor resident in an EEA country and must also fulfil certain substance requirements.
Norway imposes a 15% WHT rate on the gross payment on interest, royalties, and certain payments for lease of tangible assets to related parties resident in low-tax jurisdictions. WHT will not be imposed when the related party recipient of the interest, royalty, or lease payments is tax resident in an EEA state and is actually established and carries out genuine business activities.
A tax treaty may also reduce or exempt WHT on the payment.
