## Personal income tax rates
The income tax from the provision of personal services shall be determined by the application of progressive rates linked to a net income scale. For this purpose, the rate corresponding to every bracket of the scale shall be applied to the share of net income included in each bracket of said scale:
  * 8% up to 50 million Paraguayan guaranies (PYG).
  * 9% from PYG 50,000,001 to PYG 150 million.
  * 10% equal to or greater than PYG 150,000,001.


The tax payable will be determined by the sum of all amounts resulting from the application of the fees.
If the taxpayer's gross income from the provision of personal services does not exceed PYG 80 million, they will not be required to pay the tax.
The PIT rate on capital gains is 8%.
