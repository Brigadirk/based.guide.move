## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
In accordance with the regulations in force, foreign entities may be subject to income tax withholdings in respect of services rendered to them deemed to be of Paraguayan source, including payments made by the branch or affiliate of a foreign home office.
The non-resident tax regulates the WHT on payments to foreign suppliers for the benefit of Paraguayan entities.
The withholdings are to be made from the payments made by local entities for such services.
## Non-resident tax
In Paraguay, the principle of territoriality applies, so if entities established abroad obtain income from a Paraguayan source, they will be subject to WHT.
To this end, the non-resident tax was created, which affects income, profits, or benefits obtained by individuals, legal entities, or other entities not residing in the country. It applies to taxable events established for CIT or PIT.
Individuals, legal entities, and other entities established abroad are taxpayers of this tax when they obtain income, profit, or benefits that are covered by this tax.
The law establishes the tax base on which WHT rates should be applied because a portion of the income is considered to be obtained abroad, depending on the type of service and the territorial aspect of the tax. Tax bases are defined as a conclusive presumption (i.e. it does not accept proof to the contrary), and the 15% rate must be applied thereto.
### Opportunity for withholding, settlement, and payment
The attachment of the obligation shall occur when the funds become available, when they are remitted abroad, or whenever a payment is made, whichever comes first. Compensation, novation, transaction, and other allowed means for paying an obligation shall deem the funds to have been made available.
In the case of individuals providing independent personal services, they shall act as withholding agents only when they pay for services of a similar nature and are directly related to obtaining their taxed income from these services.
In transfers of shares or capital shares of companies established in the country between individuals, legal entities, or non-resident entities, the companies established in the country issuing the securities subject to the transaction shall be responsible for paying the seller's tax for such a transaction. In this case, the attachment of the obligation will be the date of the transaction or contract.
In international freight, the tax will be paid before the withdrawal of goods from customs.
This tax will be paid in a one-time and definitive payment.
### Source
Income from activities carried out with assets or rights used financially within the Republic by individuals, legal entities, and other non-resident entities shall be considered to have a Paraguayan source. In addition, revenues from Paraguayan sources are considered to be:
