## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 31 May 2024
Branches are taxed at the same rate as domestic corporations. Profits transferred or credited to the head office are subject to Dividends and Utilities Distribution Tax, and the tax rate is 15% if the head office is not resident and 8% if the head office is resident in Paraguay. The mentioned tax is withholding by the Paraguayan entity paying the dividends.
