The deduction applicable to pensions and life annuities is increased from 60% to 70% on the gross taxable amount not exceeding MAD 168,000.
## Exemption of new hires
An exemption is granted for salaries paid to newly recruited employees hired between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2026 for the first 36 months following their hiring date.
The employee must be recruited under an open-ended contract.
The age of the employee must not exceed 35 years at the date of conclusion of the first employment contract.
## Newly created entities
Newly created entities benefit from an exemption from individual income tax (IIT) of the gross monthly salary, capped at MAD 10,000, for an employee for a period of 24 months from the date of recruitment of the employee.
Please note the following:
  * This benefit is limited to ten employees.

## Repurchase of contributions and premiums relating to individual or group retirement insurance contracts
