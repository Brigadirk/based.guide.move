The sale of services is considered as taking place in Morocco, and thus subject to VAT, if the services sold are consumed or used in Morocco or when the service is provided remotely in digital form by a non-resident person with no place of business in Morocco to a customer whose registered office, place of business, or tax domicile is in Morocco, or to a customer who occasionally resides in Morocco.

### VAT withholding tax (WHT)
The 2024 Finance Act introduced a VAT WHT system applicable to two categories as follows:
#### VAT-registered suppliers of equipment
WHT must be levied on VAT due on taxable transactions carried out by suppliers of equipment who fail to present a recent certificate of tax compliance (issued by tax authorities within the past six months).
Companies carrying out transactions outside the scope of VAT or exempt from VAT without the deduction right are not required to operate the WHT.
#### VAT-registered service providers
75% of invoiced VAT in respect of the supply of services listed by regulation should be withheld by the following entities:
  * State, local, and regional authorities, public establishments and their subsidiaries, as well as other public bodies.


  * Entities governed by private law and individuals, whose income is determined according to the system of actual net income or simplified net income, who pay the remuneration for these services to taxable individuals who have presented a recent certificate of tax compliance. In the absence of such certificate, the WHT should be operated at up to 100% of the invoiced VAT.


The following operations are excluded from the VAT WHT:
  * Sales of electricity and water delivered to public distribution networks.
  * Sanitation services provided to subscribers by sanitation organisations, as well as the rental of water and electricity meters.
  * Sales and services provided by telecommunications operators.
  * Services provided by canvassers and insurance brokers.
  * Services worth up to MAD 5,000, up to a maximum of MAD 50,000 per month per service provider.


## Customs duties
Importation of goods in Morocco gives rise to payment of importation duties, the VAT on importation, and the special tax on importation called _Taxe Parafiscale à l’Importation_ (TPI).
Customs duties are computed on the basis of the _ad valorem_ value of the goods at the time of their entrance into Morocco.
Customs duties can be reduced if the imported products are covered by free trade agreements signed by Morocco or other specific regulatory dispositions.
Under Moroccan tax law, the importation operations are subject to VAT at the rate of 20%. A lower rate of 10% applies to specifically designated importations.
The Moroccan tax law also offers some economical customs regimes that provide VAT exemptions with credit (equivalent to zero rate).
The TPI rate is 0.25% levied on the value of the imported goods.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes apply to specific products imported or produced in Morocco, such as tobacco, alcohol, and lubricants.
## Professional tax
A professional tax is levied on individuals and enterprises that carry out a professional activity in Morocco.
The tax consists of a tax on the rental value of business premises (rented or owned) and fixed assets. The tax rates range from 10% to 30%, with exemption for the first five years of activity.
The rental value is exempted for the portion of cost exceeding MAD 50 million.
## Registration duties
Registration duties are due on all written or verbal conventions, such as property transfer of real estate, shares, or rights; company set up; equity increase; and goodwill transfer.
The rates of registration duties range from 1% to 6%. A flat rate of MAD 200 is also applicable to specific operations and conventions.
The applicable rate for the transfer of goodwill is 6%.
## Payroll taxes
Individual income tax on salaries is paid by way of withholdings made by resident employers.
## Social security contributions
The only mandatory social security regime in Morocco is the one managed by the CNSS fund (_Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale_).
The CNSS rates are as follows and apply to the gross salary, excluding exempted allowances and indemnities:
Contribution | Employee portion (%) | Employer portion (%) | Computation basis ceiling (MAD)
