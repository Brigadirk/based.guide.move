  * Permanent establishments (PEs).
  * Real estate.
  * Income from employed or self-employed activity.
  * Attendance fees.
  * Rental income.

## Communal tax
Communal tax is a surcharge on the national income tax due. Communities levy a surcharge of between 150% and 180%. The surcharges are fixed annually by the local governments. Consequently, the tax rate consists of the national tax rate combined with the surcharges, which results in tax rates from 2.5% to 22.4%.
For individuals with a limited tax liability who are ordinary tax-assessed, a general municipal multiplier of 150% will be applied.
## Lump sum taxation (tax based on expenditure)
In the case of persons who, for the first time or after at least ten years away from the country, take up residence or habitual abode in Liechtenstein, are not Liechtenstein citizens, do not work in Liechtenstein, and finance their costs of living through the income from their wealth or other funds received from abroad, a tax based on expenditure may, upon application, be levied in lieu of the wealth tax and income tax. Real estate situated in Liechtenstein is subject to the wealth tax.
