# Liechtenstein
## Overview
Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
Liechtenstein is a doubly-landlocked country in Central Europe, bordered by Switzerland to the west and south and by Austria to the east. The small, alpine country of approximately 40,000 people is divided into 11 communes. Its capital is Vaduz, and the official language is German. Liechtenstein has a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy. The country uses the Swiss franc (CHF) as its national currency.
Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since 1995, Liechtenstein is also a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and therefore closely associated to the European Union (EU) single market.
Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's attractive financial, legal, and talent environment has spurred outstanding economic growth. Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialised, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and the highest _per capita_ income in the world. The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses.
PwC has a permanent office in Liechtenstein providing tax services. In addition, PwC Liechtenstein provides assurance and consulting services.
