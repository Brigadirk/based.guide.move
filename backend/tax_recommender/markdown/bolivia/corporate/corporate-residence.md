## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
A corporation is considered resident in Bolivia if it has been incorporated in Bolivia.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Note that Bolivian commercial laws allow foreign corporations to carry out isolated commercial acts in Bolivia without the obligation to constitute a permanent representation in Bolivia; however, such corporations cannot carry out habitual commercial acts without fulfilling the requirements established to constitute a company in Bolivia (e.g. through either a subsidiary or a branch). Unfortunately, Bolivian legislation does not include provisions to regulate situations that could trigger PE nor does it define what should be understood by 'carrying out habitual commercial acts'.
