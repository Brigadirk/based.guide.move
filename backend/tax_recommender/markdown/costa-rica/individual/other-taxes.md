## Consumption taxes
### **Value-added tax (VAT)**
A VAT is imposed on the sale or transfer of tangible and intangible goods, the transfer of rights, and services that are customary and consumed within the national territory. The rate is maintained at 13%, but for some very specific cases (including health services, education, and goods of basic consumption) rates are set at 4%, 2% and 1% (respectively).
The VAT Law, law number 6826 establishes some exemptions to the VAT, for example:
Assets sell overseas and related operations, as well as the provision of services abroad.
.
### **Selective consumption tax**
The selective consumption tax may be applied at a rate of up to 100% and is levied on goods that are considered non-essential.

## Property tax
Each local municipal government is in charge of real estate appraisal. The annual property tax to be applied throughout the Costa Rican territory is 0.25% of the appraised value, registered in the respective municipality where the tax liability originates.
## Real estate transfer tax
Real estate transfer tax is calculated as 1.5% of the selling price of the real estate or its property tax value, whichever is greater. The tax is triggered by the direct sale of the real estate or through the indirect transfer of real estate when there is a modification in the control of the entity holding the real estate.
