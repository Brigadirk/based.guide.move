## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
The payments of certain remunerations are subject to corporate WHT in Tunisia.
The WHT is an advance payment of CIT and is thus deductible from the CIT due by the invoicing entity. To this end, the paying entity shall withhold the tax at the appropriate rate. It shall then issue a WHT certificate to the invoicing company to enable the latter to use the certificate as proof of the payment at the moment of filing its CIT return. The paying entity subsequently pays the withheld amount to the tax authorities.
According to the Finance Law for 2022, WHT certificates will be issued through an electronic platform that will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance. The scope, terms, and deadlines for the application of this provision will be set by an order of the Minister of Finance.
Regarding the WHT imputation, the Finance Law provides that WHT that should be issued on the electronic platform that has been issued manually, paid by any taxpayer or on one's behalf for a fiscal year, is not deductible from the CIT due. WHT on VAT is deductible only if it is covered by a certificate issued on the platform (subject to the terms and deadlines that will be set by the order of the Minister of Finance).
A tax fine equal to 30% of the amount of the WHT, with a minimum of TND 50 per certificate, is applicable for any person who submits a WHT certificate issued manually without going through the electronic platform set up by the Ministry of Finance.
The withheld tax is to be declared and repaid by the paying entity each month before the 28th day of the following month. The Finance Law for 2024 reduced the deadline for submission of the monthly tax return from day 28 to day 20 of the following month for companies that file and pay their tax returns electronically.
The rates of the WHT differ according to the nature of the goods/services and the rates applicable within the framework of the DTTs.
The Finance Law for 2021 has amended many WHT rates. Applicable WHT rates in Tunisia as of 1 January 2021 are as follows:
  * 10% of the gross amount of the invoices related to fees, commissions, brokerage fees, rentals, payment of non-commercial activities. The rate of 10% is reduced to 3% for fees when these amounts are paid to entities subject to CIT and individuals who keep proper accounts in accordance with the Tunisian accounting principles.
  * 15% on performance bonus paid to distributors of goods.
  * 20% on interest. This does not include interest on deposits and bonds in foreign currency or convertible dinars. 
  * 20% on director’s attendance allowance. 
  * 10% on bank loans interests granted by non-Tunisian resident banks.
  * 2.5% on the sales price indicated in a real estate sale, in case the seller is an individual.
  * 1.5% on payments exceeding TND 1,000 (including VAT) made for the acquisition of goods and services necessary to the activity and that are not subject to a specific WHT rate. This rate is reduced to 1% for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 15%. This rate is also reduced to 0.5% for companies subject to CIT at the rate of 10%.
  * 15% on other payments made to non-Tunisian tax resident persons (subject to more favourable rates provide by DTT).
  * 15% on other payments made to non-Tunisian tax resident persons deemed to have a PE in Tunisia and that fail to register with the tax authorities.
  * Dividends distributed by Tunisian-resident companies to non-resident, non-established companies, to non-resident individuals, and to resident individuals are subject to a discharging WHT at the rate of 10% of its total amount.
  * 25% on payments (payments for services, interests and director’s attendance allowances, dividends and branch tax, interests paid to banks) made to persons resident in territories/states with a privileged tax regime. It should be noted that the Finance Law for 2019 redefined the concept of 'tax havens' as 'countries or territories with a privileged tax regime', which are defined as countries or territories whose CIT rate is lower than 50% of the CIT rate due in Tunisia under the same activity. The list of the said countries/territories are fixed by a decision of the Finance Minister. In addition, the Finance Law for 2019 provided that the WHT due on payments related to services realised by companies tax resident or established in territories/states with a privileged tax regime deemed to be realised under a PE located in Tunisia and that fail to register with the tax authorities are subject to the WHT at the rate of 25% instead of 15% applicable as per the domestic law.
  * 25% on lottery and gambling gain.


## DTT rates
Note that the following WHT rates are applicable to amounts payable to non-resident, non-established companies and financial institutions according to DTTs concluded by Tunisia.
The DTT rate is applicable in case it is lower than the domestic law, provided that the beneficiary of the payment provides the corresponding tax residency certificate. In case of failure, the domestic law will be applied.
