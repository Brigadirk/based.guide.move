# Tunisia
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 13 December 2024
Two laws have been promulgated in order to promote investment in Tunisia, the Investment Law and the Tax Incentives Law.
## Investment Law n° 2016-71 of 30 September 2016
### Objectives of the Investment Law
The purpose of the Investment Law is to promote investment and to encourage the creation of enterprises, notably through:
  * Increasing the added value, competitiveness, and export capacity of the national economy, and technological development at the regional and international levels.
  * Job creation and promotion of human resources competence.
  * Achieving an integrated and balanced regional development.
  * Achieving sustainable development.


### Main features of the Investment Law
The Investment Law defines the legal regime for investment promoted by persons, resident or non-resident, in all sectors of economic activities, fixed by decree.
Under the Investment Law, investors benefit from the following incentives:
  * Right to acquire, lease, or operate non-agricultural immovable property.
  * Possibility of recruiting executives of foreign nationality for up to 30% of the total number of managers; this rate is reduced to 10% as of the fourth year. In all cases, the company can recruit four executives of foreign nationality (even if the limit of 30% or 10% is less than four).
  * Free transfer of the profit, dividends, and capital abroad in foreign currency, in accordance with the applicable foreign exchange legislation. Indeed, the Investment Law specifies that the investor is free to transfer one’s capital and profits abroad in foreign currency (in compliance with the applicable foreign exchange legislation). In case the transfer requires authorisation from the Tunisian Central Bank, any refusal must be in writing. The failure to reply within the time limit to be set by decree is considered as an acceptance (except for activities excepted to be defined by decree).
  * Investment subsidies for direct investment operations, as follows: 
    * Subsidies for the increase in value added and competitiveness.
    * Subsidies for the development of employability capacity.
    * Subsidies for regional development.
    * Subsidies for sustainable development.
Conditions and modalities to benefit from subsidies are defined by decree.
  * Possibility to benefit from arbitration in case of dispute with the Tunisian State. The Investment Law provides rules for settlement of disputes between the Tunisian State and foreign investors. These shall be settled by conciliation; otherwise, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration under a specific agreement between the two parties. In case the dispute is not settled through conciliation and in the absence of an arbitration agreement, the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of Tunisian courts.


Also, as per the Investment Law, foreign investors have the same rights and obligations provided for by the Investment Law as Tunisian investors in comparable situations.
The Investment Law provided for the need to comply with response deadlines for each authorisation requested by the investor and the obligation to justify each refusal in writing. Failure to reply within the time limit constitutes acceptance under article 4 of the Law (except for activities excepted to be defined by decree).
Investors’ properties and intellectual property (IP) rights are protected in accordance with the legislation in force. Investor's property may not be expropriated except for public interest reasons, without discrimination between Tunisian and foreign investors, subject to fair and equitable compensation.
## Tax Incentives Law n° 2017-8 of 14 February 2017
The major tax incentives provided for by the Tax Incentives Law are mainly relating to:
  * Export operations. 
  * Investments in regional development zones.
  * Agricultural development.
  * Support and depollution activities.
  * Newly created companies.


## Wholly exporting activities
The following are considered as wholly exporting companies:
  * Companies with products manufactured in Tunisia, totally destined to be sold outside Tunisia.
  * Companies providing services totally used/exploited outside Tunisia.
  * Companies operating in agriculture and fisheries, manufacturing, and craft industries that sell all their products to wholly exporting companies, as well as companies established in business parks, provided that such products and goods constitute components of the final product to be exported (note that this condition no longer required as of 2021 for companies incorporated up to 2018 and as of 2019 for companies incorporated in 2019), and to international trade wholly exporting enterprises.
  * Companies that carry out all their services for the benefit of wholly exporting companies, companies established in the economic activity parks, and international trade totally exporting companies, in the subcontracting operations, within the same sector (note that this condition no longer required as of 2021 for companies incorporated up to 2018 and as of 2019 for companies incorporated in 2019)or within the framework of services directly linked to production (set by decree).


Note that wholly exporting companies may commercialise locally, during a given year, up to 30% of the turnover of the previous year without losing the status of a wholly exporting company. It is noteworthy that the turnover derived from the sales of waste to companies authorised by the Ministry of the Environment for the exercise of recovery, recycling, and treatment activities, as well as the services or sales realised within international public tenders, are not included in the rate of 30%.

However, in the presence of DTTs, in cases where profits derived from outside Tunisia were subject to CIT in Tunisia, the foreign tax, if any, is deductible, but only up to the corresponding Tunisian tax on these profits.
