## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Branches are taxed solely on the income derived from activities in Turkey since they are regarded as non-resident entities for Turkish tax purposes. Branch profits are subject to Turkish CIT at the rate of 25% (same as subsidiaries). 
The branch profit transferred to headquarters (i.e. upstream income repatriation) is subject to dividend WHT at a rate of 10%, which might be reduced if there is a bilateral tax treaty between Turkey and the country of which the principal is a resident for income tax purposes. _See the section for a list of countries with which Turkey has an applicable tax treaty_.
