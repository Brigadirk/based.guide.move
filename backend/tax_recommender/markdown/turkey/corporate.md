## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Withholding tax rate on dividends increased
The withholding tax rate applicable on dividend payments has been increased to 15% effective from 22 December 2024. Accordingly, any dividends paid to a resident or non-resident individual, or a non-resident company on or after 22 December 2024 will be subject to 15% withholding tax, unless the rate is reduced under a tax treaty. 
No withholding tax is imposed on dividends paid to a resident company and hence the recent amendment does not have impact on profit distributions from a resident company to another resident company. 
## The law implementing Pillar Two rules enters into effect
The law number 7524 introducing implementation of the Pillar Two rules appeared in the Official Gazette of 2 August 2024. Similar to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Rules and the Pillar Two Directive, the Turkish Pillar Two legislation will apply to constituent entities that are members of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group that has annual revenue of Turkish equivalent of 750 million euros (EUR) or more in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent company in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year.
In general, the Turkish Pillar Two provisions do not differ significantly from the European Union (EU) Minimum Tax Directive. Very briefly, the Turkish Pillar Two regulations introduce the global minimum top-up taxation rules by providing for the main interlocking measures, i.e. the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Undertaxed Payment Rule (UTPR) as well as a Qualifying Domestic Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) under the safe-harbour OECD standards. The new rules are effective for fiscal years starting from 1 January 2024, except for the UTPR provisions, which apply to fiscal years starting from 1 January 2025.
## Implementation of a domestic minimum corporate tax regime
Law number 7524, published in the Official Gazette on 2 August 2024, introduces a domestic minimum tax regime that aims to ensure the corporate tax is not less than 10% of corporate income before certain exemptions and deductions. Under the new rule, the corporate taxpayers will compute their tax liability under both the standard regime (i.e. 25% tax on taxable income after deductions and exemptions) and under a parallel regime (i.e. 10% tax on taxable income before certain deductions and exemptions). The larger amount is then payable. The domestic minimum tax regime will apply to fiscal years starting from 1 January 2025.
## Amendment to the participation exemption regime for foreign-sourced dividends
Law number 7491, published in the Official Gazette on 28 December 2023, introduced a new provision allowing tax exemption on 50% of the dividends from non-resident companies, while the full exemption still stands for those who can qualify. The only requirements to benefit from the 50% exemption are:
  * a minimum holding of 10% in the share capital of the foreign company, and
  * dividends must be remitted to Turkey by the date corporate income tax (CIT) is due. 


Turkish companies that previously could not benefit from the full exemption (i.e. because they could not meet the required conditions) may now have the possibility to claim a partial (50%) exemption on their dividend income from foreign companies.
## Change in CIT rate
With the Law number 7456 published on 15 July 2023:
  * The CIT rate has been increased to 25% from 20% for companies other than those in the financial sector.
  * For companies in the financial sector (e.g. banks, financial leasing companies, electronic payment and money institutions, asset management companies, capital market institutions, insurance companies, private pension companies), the CIT rate has been increased to 30% from 25%.
  * Companies engaged in export activities will benefit from a reduction of 5 percentage points in their CIT rate, instead of the previous 1 percentage point.
  * The new CIT rates will apply from 2023 (starting from the advance tax returns to be filed after 1 October 2023).


## Withholding tax (WHT) on share buybacks increased to 15% for unlisted companies
With the Presidential Decree no. 6791, published in the Official Gazette on 14 February 2023, the WHT rate on deemed dividends in connection with share buybacks by Turkish resident companies was reduced to 0% from 15%.
Presidential Decree no. 7343, published on 7 July 2023, has narrowed the scope of application of the 0% WHT on deemed distributions on share buybacks, so that it no longer applies to share buybacks by unlisted companies. Accordingly, the WHT rate has been reset at 15% for unlisted companies. The amendment is applicable to deemed distributions in relation to shares acquired after 7 July 2023.
## Increase in value-added tax (VAT) rates 
The Presidential Decree no. 7346, published in the Official Gazette on 7 July 2023, has increased the VAT rates as follows:
  * Standard VAT rate rises to 20% from 18%.
  * Reduced VAT rate rises to 10% from 8%.


The new rates will apply as of 10 July 2023.
The Presidential Decree does not bring any change to the reduced VAT rate of 1%.
## The new supplementary tax for corporate taxpayers 
Law number 7440, published in the Official Gazette on 12 March 2023, introduced a supplementary tax of 10% (5% in certain situations) for corporate taxpayers. The supplementary tax is payable on the portion of 2022 corporate income that is taxed at a reduced rate or is exempt. The additional tax should be assessed regardless of whether the taxpayer has a CIT liability in 2022 or not. 
The deadline for payment of the first instalment of the new tax is the same as the deadline for payment of the CIT for 2022 (30 April 2023). The second instalment is payable in the fourth month following this period (31 August 2023).
## Limitation to the notional interest deduction rule 
The right to claim notional interest deductions, which was available for an indefinite period under the old legislation, has been limited to the fiscal year in which the capital increase is registered and the following four fiscal years. For newly established companies and for companies that increased their capital before the amending law was published on 5 July 2022, the five-year limitation will start in 2022. 
## Inflation accounting postponed to 2023
Law number 7352, published in the Official Gazette on 29 January 2022, postpones the implementation of inflation accounting until the end of 2023. The gains and losses arising from inflation accounting in 2023 will not be taxable or tax-deductible (i.e. it will have no effect on the tax calculations).
## CIT reduction for exporters and manufacturers
Law number 7351, passed on 19 January 2022, allows for a CIT rate reduction of 1% on income generated from manufacturing and exportation. The regulation is effective for years 2022 and onward. This means that while the tax rate for other companies is 23% in 2022, for qualifying manufacturers and exporters it is 22% for the portion of their income resulting from exporting and manufacturing activities.
Manufacturers who also engage in exportation shall benefit from the reduction only for manufacturing; they may not claim a second reduction for exportation.
## Declaration of ultimate beneficial ownership (UBO) now required in Turkey
A new compliance requirement is now imposed on companies doing business in Turkey, calling for annual declaration of the UBO information to the tax office.
In addition, designated institutions and professions covered by the anti-money laundering law (e.g. banks, payment agencies, finance companies, lawyers, accountants, notaries) are also required to report the beneficial ownership information of their clients, when and if requested by the Revenue Administration.


# Turkey
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
All Turkish taxes are imposed under laws drafted by or with the involvement of the Turkish MoF and are promulgated by the Turkish Parliament. The central government, acting through the MoF, imposes most of them, although local authorities have certain rights over some minor transaction charges. Tax procedures are governed by the Turkish tax procedural law.
## Taxable period
The taxable period is the calendar year. Note that a different fiscal year is also allowed.
## Tax returns
A self-assessment system is used in Turkey.
In principle, residents and non-resident entities having a PE in Turkey are obligated to be registered for all taxes in Turkey (e.g. CIT, VAT, WHT, stamp tax) and file annual CIT returns.
The last date of submission of the CIT return is the 30th day of the fourth month following the fiscal year-end. This date will be 30 April if CIT returns are filed on a calendar-year basis. 
## Payment of tax
Taxable income is declared on a quarterly-basis as advance tax on the 17th day of the second month following each quarter, and corresponding tax is payable on the 17th day of the same period. Advance CIT paid is offset against the final (i.e. fiscal year-end) CIT calculated in the annual CIT return.
The last date of payment of CIT is the 30th day of the fourth month following the fiscal year-end. 
## Tax audit process
The tax authorities in Turkey do not have a regular audit cycle for every taxpayer. Tax audits are usually performed based on selection through risk assessment software, where they can conduct either sector-specific or issue-specific audits.
## Statute of limitations
The Turkish tax system is based on self-assessment, and there is no procedure to agree the filed tax returns with the tax authorities that can prevent further inspections. Tax returns filed by companies remain open to tax inspection until the end of the five-year statute of limitations according to the provisions of Turkish Tax Procedural Law.
## Topics of focus for tax authority
The tax authority has recently inspected companies for the following topics:
  * Transfer pricing.
  * Capital decrease.
  * Loss compensation fund.
  * Partial spin-off.
  * Thin capitalisation.


## Corporate income tax certification
In Turkey, a special kind of tax control mechanism is established called 'corporate income tax certification'. Under this mechanism, the tax authority accepts accounts and tax returns of taxpayers whose accounts are audited and certified by Sworn Fiscal Advisors (SFAs) to be true and correct unless proved to be incorrect. On the other hand, the MoF has announced that those companies that do not have their tax returns certified as such will be on the priority list for tax inspection. The Ministry sets standards of work to be done for any taxpayer wanting to use an SFA. At the end of each year, SFAs have to prepare a comprehensive report to be submitted to the MoF and to certify the accuracy of the CIT return.
The work is carried out over the statutory financials that are subject to tax calculations. Note that this service is not of a 'statutory audit' nature, technically it is 'non-audit assurance' work.
The tax certification process helps to identify and take corrective measures against erroneous applications that may otherwise be detected only upon a tax investigation by the Turkish MoF.


# Turkey
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
If both the legal and the business headquarters of a company are located outside Turkey, the company is regarded as a non-resident entity for Turkish tax purposes. If one of these headquarters is located within Turkey, the company is regarded as a resident entity for Turkish tax purposes.
Note that there is no distinction between CIT and VAT registration in Turkey. Therefore, corporations or permanent establishments (PEs) are liable for all taxes (e.g. CIT, VAT, WHT, stamp tax) once they are registered for tax purposes in Turkey.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Unlike the provisions of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, there is no minimum period of presence in Turkey before a presence is regarded under the Turkish tax legislation as a PE. In this regard, we believe that the PE evaluation should be made for each case depending on the merits of the case, both from a local legislation perspective and from a treaty (if applicable) perspective.


# Turkey
## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Turkish CIT legislation allows a deduction for all the 'ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred for the generation and sustenance of income during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business'.
The general principle for tax deductibility is that the payment should be a necessary business expense and it should be properly documented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Turkish transfer pricing regulations and those in the local tax procedural law.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Fixed assets are subject to depreciation at rates determined by the Turkish Ministry of Finance (MoF), based on their useful life.
Intangible assets (i.e. licence, franchise, copyright, etc.) and goodwill are depreciated over 15 years and five years, respectively. Additionally, leasehold improvement is depreciated based on lease period.
Depreciation can be calculated by applying either the straight-line or declining-balance method (limited to 50%), at the taxpayer’s discretion. The taxpayer may also change the option from declining-balance to straight-line (but not _vice versa_) at any time during the life of the asset. The applicable rate for the declining-balance method is twice the rate of the straight-line method, subject to certain limitations. Furthermore, in special cases, the tax authorities may determine higher depreciation rates.
Intangible assets are amortised by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, if objectively determinable.
Profits or losses on disposal of fixed assets (i.e. the difference between the proceeds and the written-down values) are included in taxable income in the year of disposal. If the renewal of disposed-of assets is considered necessary by the owners of the business concern, the profit accrued may be retained for a certain amount of time. After the purchase of new fixed assets, the profits may be offset against the depreciation of the new assets.
A limitation has been introduced with the introduction of Communiqué No. 311 on Income Taxation and Law No. 7194, limiting the deduction of expenses relating to passenger vehicles to 70% of these expenses and a maximum of TRY 26,000 for rental expenses of personal automobiles (with an exemption of financial leasing) in determining commercial and professional earnings.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses are considered as deductible expenses as incurred. Also, the taxpayer has the option to capitalise such expenses and to depreciate them over five years at equal amounts.
## Interest expenses
In Turkey, interest is generally treated as an ordinary business expense and is tax deductible. There are certain limitations, such as the arm’s-length principle and thin capitalisation rule for related-party borrowings (_please see Thin capitalisation in the section for more information_).
Starting from year 2021, a new restriction also applies in situations where the amount of external financing of the taxpayer exceeds the taxpayer's equity. In such situations, 10% of the borrowing costs (such as interest, commission, exchange rate differences) corresponding to the excess borrowing become non-deductible for corporate tax purposes. Interest and similar payments capitalised to the cost of investment are not subject to deduction limitation. Different than the thin capitalisation rule, this new limitation applies to all borrowings, related party or third party. Credit institutions, financial institutions, financial leasing companies, factoring companies, and financing companies are excluded from the application of this restriction.
## Notional interest deduction 
For capital contributions in cash, a tax incentive of notional interest deduction is available, allowing companies (except for those that operate in banking, finance, and insurance sectors) to deduct from their taxable income a notional interest calculated based on their capital amounts contributed after 1 July 2015. 
The deduction is equal to 50% of the notional interest that is calculated on the qualifying capital increase (net of qualifying decrease). The deduction rate is 75% for capital sourced from abroad. The notional interest rate is determined based on the interest rates the Turkish Central Bank announces annually in relation to commercial bank credits. 
With the Law no. 7417, published in the Official Gazette on 5 July 2022, the right to claim notional interest deductions, which was available for an indefinite period, has been limited to the fiscal year in which the decision on capital increase is registered and the following four fiscal years. For newly established companies and for companies that increased their capital before the amending law was published on 5 July 2022, the five-year limitation started in 2022.
## Bad debt
Bad and doubtful accounts receivable are deductible under certain conditions. Amounts of the receivables collected afterwards are added to the profits of the year in which they are collected.
## Charitable contributions
Donations to listed charities and for construction of schools, hospitals, and scientific research organisations are deductible at up to 5% of the company’s gross profit.
## Pensions and employee termination benefits
Payments for pensions and employee termination benefits are deductible for CIT purposes under certain conditions.
## Fines and penalties
In principle, fines and penalties incurred due to the wrong-doings of the taxpayer or its employees are not tax deductible.
## Taxes
Essentially, the CIT itself and VAT are, subject to certain exceptions, not deductible for CIT purposes.
Fees and duties paid in relation to assets of the company are, in principle, deductible in determining taxable corporate income.
## Net operating losses
Corporate losses may be carried forward for five years. Losses cannot be carried back.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Charges for royalties and interest by foreign affiliates may be deductible for CIT purposes, provided that transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules are followed (_see the section for more information_).


# Turkey
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Consolidation of the accounts of group companies for tax purposes is not allowed in Turkey since each company is regarded as a separate taxpayer.
## Transfer pricing
The Corporate Tax Law (CTL) includes transfer pricing regulations, using the OECD's guidelines as a basis. If a taxpayer enters into transactions regarding the sale or purchase of goods and services with related parties in which prices are not set in accordance with the arm's-length principle, the related profits are considered to have been distributed in a disguised manner through transfer pricing. Such disguised profit distribution through transfer pricing is not accepted as deductible for CIT purposes. The methods prescribed in the law are the traditional transaction methods described in the OECD's transfer pricing guidelines.
### Transfer pricing documentation
The three-tiered approach that was adopted in many countries after the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project was included into the General Communique Serial No. 4 on Disguised Profit Distribution through Transfer Pricing, published in Turkey on 1 September 2020. Based on the current Turkish transfer pricing legislation effective as of 1 September 2020, there are four types of documentation requirements for taxpayers:
  * Annual Transfer Pricing Report (preparation by the deadline of annual CIT return declaration, and submission to Turkish tax authorities upon request within 15 days).
  * The Transfer Pricing, Controlled Foreign Corporations, and Thin Capitalization Form ('Appendix 3 Form', which is presented as an attachment to the annual CIT return).
  * Master File (preparation by the end of the 12th month following the relevant fiscal year, and submission to Turkish tax authorities upon request within 15 days).
  * Country-by-Country Report (CbCR) and CbCR Notification (submission to the Turkish tax authorities by the end of the 12th month following the relevant fiscal year and electronically by the end of June of the year following the relevant fiscal year, respectively).


## Thin capitalisation
According to local thin capitalisation regulation, if the ratio of the borrowings from shareholders or from persons related to the shareholders exceeds triple the shareholders' equity of the borrower company at any time within the relevant year, the exceeding portion of the borrowing will be considered thin capital and the corresponding interest will not be deductible. Accordingly, the ratio of loans received from related parties to shareholders' equity must be no more than 3:1 in order to eliminate Turkish thin capitalisation issues.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
Turkish taxpayers are generally not subject to Turkish taxation on the earnings of their foreign corporate subsidiaries. Instead, Turkish taxation on such earnings is generally deferred until the earnings are distributed to the Turkish shareholder. The major exception to this rule is the CFC regime regulated under Article 7 of the CIT Law. Under this regime, Turkish shareholders (individual or corporation) are subject to Turkish taxation on their pro rata share of a CFC’s undistributed earnings, as if such earnings had been distributed currently, based on certain conditions.
A CFC is a company established abroad with at least 50% of the organisation controlled directly or indirectly by tax-resident companies and real persons by means of separate or joint participation in the capital, dividends, or voting rights. A CFC also must meet certain conditions (e.g. 25% or more of its gross revenue must be comprised of passive income, it must be subject to an effective income tax rate lower than 10% for its commercial profit in its home country, gross revenue of the subsidiary established abroad must be more than the foreign currency equivalent of TRY 100,000 for the related fiscal year).
The CFC's profit is included in the CIT base of the controlling resident corporation at the rate of the shares controlled, irrespective of whether it is distributed.


# Turkey
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
Branches are taxed solely on the income derived from activities in Turkey since they are regarded as non-resident entities for Turkish tax purposes. Branch profits are subject to Turkish CIT at the rate of 25% (same as subsidiaries). 
The branch profit transferred to headquarters (i.e. upstream income repatriation) is subject to dividend WHT at a rate of 10%, which might be reduced if there is a bilateral tax treaty between Turkey and the country of which the principal is a resident for income tax purposes. _See the section for a list of countries with which Turkey has an applicable tax treaty_.


# Turkey
## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
## Foreign tax credit
A tax credit is granted for foreign tax paid, up to the amount of Turkish CIT attributable to the foreign income. Any unused credit may be carried forward to the following three years. The foreign tax paid must be documented through foreign tax office receipts approved by the Turkish consulate in the country in which the foreign tax was paid. Special conditions apply to foreign tax credits relating to dividends received by Turkish resident companies from their foreign participations. 
## Exemption for income from foreign construction and repair activities
The profit from construction and repair activities carried out by Turkish corporations in foreign countries may be exempt from CIT in Turkey under the Turkish CTL. It should be noted that if loss occurs from these activities, it is not possible to deduct this loss amount from the income generated through domestic activities since deduction of a loss relating to foreign activities that are exempt from CIT in Turkey is not allowed for deduction.
## Investment incentives
Investment incentives are available to investors through an Investment Incentive Certificate (IIC), which is obtained from the General Directorate of Incentive Practises and Foreign Capital under the Ministry of Industry and Technology. 
In order for an investment to be granted an IIC, the minimum investment expenditures should be at least TRY 3 million for the first two regions and TRY 1.5 million for other regions. To be granted incentives, investment projects are subject to evaluation by the Ministry of Industry and Technology. The incentives under an IIC can be summarised as follows:
  * VAT exemption on machinery and equipment.
  * Customs duty exemption on machinery and equipment.
  * Reduction in CIT.
  * Social security premium support (employer's share).
  * Social security premium support (employee's share).
  * Interest rate or dividend support.
  * Land allocation.
  * VAT refund.


In general, the investment incentive legislation is comprised of general, regional, and strategic investment incentive schemes. 
### General investment scheme
Investments that are not qualified as special types of investments are subject to general incentives. The incentives available to general investments are customs duty and VAT exemption on the purchase of investment goods (i.e. machinery and equipment).
### Regional and sector-based investments scheme 
Turkey is separated into six regions based on the development level of district/cities in these regions. The first three zones represent more developed regions, whereas the last three are relatively less developed zones. The sectors to be supported in each region are determined in accordance with regional potential and the scale of economy, while the intensity of support (incentive) varies depending on the level of development in the region. The incentives available under the regional investment scheme are customs duty and VAT exemption on the purchase of investment goods (i.e. machinery and equipment), CIT rate reduction, social security premium support (employer's share), land allocation, and interest rate support. In case of investments in region 6, social security premium support for employee’s share is also available. 
### Strategic investments scheme
The Program Evaluation Committee, within the scope of the Technology Oriented Industry Move Program, may decide to support the investment projects that are suitable for the production of the products in the Preferential Product List and meet the criteria to be determined by the Communiqué, as strategic investments.
Based on the related legislation, investments in production of products that are highly dependent on imports and meet all the following criteria will be regarded as strategic investments:
  * Minimum fixed investment amount should be more than TRY 50 million.
  * Total domestic production capacity for a given product that is the matter of investment should be below the import amount.
  * Added value to be generated with the investment should be at least 40%.
  * The total import amount realised related to the invested product within the prior year should be more than USD 50 million.


Prioritised investments with over TRY 3 billion of minimum fixed investments will be qualified as strategic investments.
The incentives available under the strategic investments scheme are customs duty and VAT exemption on the purchase of investment goods (i.e. machinery and equipment), CIT rate reduction, social security premium support (employer's share), land allocation, interest rate support, and VAT refund.
### Project-based investment incentive package
In addition to the investment incentive legislation, a project-based investment incentive package (also known as super incentives package) is also available. It aims to provide financial support for innovative, technology-oriented, research and development (R&D) focused, high value-added projects that also contribute to reducing foreign dependency. Projects seeking support under the incentive schemes must conform with the Turkish government's targets as set out in national development plans and annual programs, and with those promoted by the Ministry of Industry and Technology.
### Technology Focused Industry Move program
The Technology Focused Industry Move program is a special program with the purpose of increasing the value-added production in Turkey. The support and incentives provided by the Ministry and its affiliated/related organisations are aimed at being intensified for the industries with medium-high and high-tech level. Increase in production capacity of the products with high future potential and critical importance is the aim of this program. 
Preferential Product List: Products in medium-high and high technology sectors, according to the definition of the OECD, as well as products that have critical importance for the development of these industries as determined by the Ministry. 
In order for projects to be evaluated within the scope of the Decision, the minimum fixed investment amount for the Technology Focused Industry Move program should be TRY 50 million. For other investments, the minimum fixed investment amount should be TRY 500 million.
Incentive items include customs duty and VAT exemption, CIT reduction, income tax withholding support, social security premium support (employer’s share), qualified personnel support, energy support, land allocation, interest rate support, capital contribution support, infrastructure support, purchasing guarantee (for the goods produced through the investment supported), facilitation of authorisation/permit licence procedures, and VAT refund.
## Free trade zones
Free trade zones are special sites that lie geographically within the country but are deemed to be outside the customs territory. In these regions, the normal regulations related to foreign trade and other financial and economic areas are either inapplicable, partly applicable, or superseded by new regulations.
In general, activities such as manufacturing, storage, packing, general trading, banking, insurance, and trade may be performed in Turkish free trade zones. Goods moving between Turkey and the zones are treated, for all purposes, as exports or imports. However, operations within the zones are subject to the supervision of the zone management (and customs authorities), to whom regular activity reports must be submitted. Consequently, there is a requirement for zone users to maintain full accounting records (in Turkish) with respect to their activities. These accounting requirements extend to inventory records. Customs duty is levied on any unexplained inventory losses as though the goods had been imported into the country.
The right to operate in a free trade zone is conferred by an operating licence obtained from the Ministry of Economy, which reviews the application for conformity with the objectives and types of activity specified by the Economic Affairs Coordination Council.
## Research, development, and design activities
In the last decade, the Turkish Parliament has enacted several regulations to provide incentives for R&D and design activities in Turkey. Tax incentives and support mechanisms that are provided to companies carrying out R&D, innovation, and design activities in Turkey are as follows:
R&D legislation:
  * Law No. 5746 on Support for Research, Development, and Design Activities.
  * Law No. 4691 on Technology Development Zones.
  * Institutions providing cash supports on project basis: 
    * Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK).
    * Ministry of Industry and Technology.
    * Small and Medium Industry Development Organization (KOSGEB).
    * Development Agency.
    * European Commission.


### Law No. 5746 on Support of R&D and Design Activities
#### R&D deduction (100%)
All eligible innovation and R&D or design expenditures made in technology centres, R&D centres (which must employ at least 15* full-time equivalent R&D personnel), design centres (which must employ at least 10 full-time equivalent design personnel), R&D and innovation or design projects supported by governmental institutions, foundations established by law, or international funds can be deducted from the CIT base at a rate of 100%. The same expenditures should also be capitalised and expensed through amortisation over five years in the case of successful projects, whereas failed projects’ R&D and design expenditures can be expensed immediately.
In addition, in the event of providing an increase of at least 20% in any of the following indicators in R&D or design centres compared to the previous year, then 50% of the increase in the amount of R&D, innovation, or design expenses compared to the previous year will also be taken into consideration as an extra deduction in the calculation of the CIT base:
  * R&D or design expenditures share in total turnover.
  * The registered number of national or international patents.
  * The number of internationally funded projects.
  * The ratio of researchers holding graduate degrees to total R&D personnel.
  * The ratio of the number of total researchers to total R&D personnel.
  * The ratio of new products (output of successful R&D projects) turnover to total turnover.


* With the Council of Ministers’ decision, the minimum number of full-time equivalent R&D personnel that should be employed in R&D centres is reduced to 15 according to Law No. 5746 on Supporting Research, Development and Design Activities. However, the aforementioned number will continue to be considered as 30 for sectors (29.10.01, 29.10.02, 29.10.03, 29.10.04, and 29.10.07 classes and 30.30, 30.40, and 30.99 classes under the C - Manufacturing section) according to the Statistical Classification on Economic Activities for European Community (NACE Rev. 2).
#### Income tax exemption (95%, 90%, or 80%)
The salaries of R&D, design, and support personnel, at a rate of 95% for the personnel with a PhD degree or master’s degree on 'supported programs' declared by the Ministry, 90% for the personnel with a master’s degree or undergraduate degree on supported programs declared by the Ministry, and 80% for others, is exempt from income tax.
#### Social security premium support (50%)
Half of the employer portion of social security premiums for R&D, design, and support personnel (maximum of 10% of the number of full-time R&D and design personnel) will be funded by the MoF for each R&D and support personnel.
#### VAT exemption and amortisation on machines and equipment acquired for R&D and design activities
Deliveries of machines and equipment that will be used for R&D, innovation, and design projects by the R&D Centres are exempt from VAT.
Stamp tax exemption
The documents prepared for the R&D and design activities, including the payrolls of R&D, design, and support personnel, are exempt from stamp tax.
#### Customs duty exemption
Goods imported for the usage of studies in R&D, innovation, and design projects are exempt from customs duties. Additionally, any funds, held papers, and applied transactions are exempt from stamp tax and fees.
#### Additional support for personnel graduated from 'supported programs' declared by the Ministry
The minimum gross wage portion of monthly salaries of each R&D or design personnel that have at least a bachelor’s degree in 'supported programs' declared by the Ministry employed in R&D and design centres will be financed from the budget of the Ministry of Industry and Technology for two years, under the specific circumstances stated in the R&D legislation.
Please note that, contract-based R&D activities will be out of the scope as stated in the aforementioned Decision, as the companies do not need any intellectual property (IP) registration for contract-based R&D activities to utilise CIT exemption.
If the project results in a loss, it is not possible to deduct this loss from the CIT base. In addition, the income from other activities (other than R&D and software income) is subject to CIT. 
### Law No. 4691 on Technology Development Zones
#### CIT exemption
The profits derived from the software activities or products developed as a result of the R&D activities in techno parks are exempt from CIT.
In accordance with the decision of the Council of Ministers issued in the official gazette dated 19 October 2017, in order for companies operating in technology development zones to benefit from CIT exemption over the income that is derived from the sale, transfer, or lease of IP, these IPs should be subjected to patents or patent equivalent documents (utility model certificate, design registration certificate, copyright registration certificate, integrated circuit topography registration certificate, certificate of breeding of new plant varieties, etc.).
Please note that, contract-based R&D activities will be out of the scope as stated in the aforementioned Decision, as the companies do not need any IP registration for contract-based R&D activities to utilise the CIT exemption.

Treaty benefits are applicable subject to the fulfilment of the treaty eligibility conditions. Please note that dividend distributions to resident companies are not subject to WHT.

  2. As per the provisions of the protocol amending the agreement, the rate may be (partially or wholly) reduced: 
     * For the Netherlands: To 10%, as long as, under the provisions of the Netherlands Company Tax Act and to the future amendments thereto, a company that is a resident of the Netherlands is not charged tax with respect to dividends the company receives from a company that is a resident of Turkey.
     * For Belgium: To 10%, as long as, under the provisions of the Belgian laws and of the future amendments thereto, a company that is a resident of Belgium is not charged tax with respect to dividends the company receives from a company that is a resident of Turkey.
     * For Austria: To 5%, if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends, provided that such dividends are exempt from tax in Austria.

  5. The income should be subject to full corporate taxation in the hands of the Turkish tax-resident subsidiary.
  6. If the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of Saudi Arabia, the tax so charged shall not exceed 5% of the gross amount of the dividends provided: (i) the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly holds at least 20% of the capital of the Turkish company paying the dividends or (ii) the beneficial owner is a central bank or an entity that is wholly owned by the government.
  7. In case of Turkey, the tax rate shall not exceed 5%, to the extent that they are paid out of profits that have been subject to full rate of CIT in Turkey (i.e. without benefiting from tax exemption).
  8. The rate of the income tax shall not exceed 5% if it is derived by the Government Pension Fund (_Statens Pensjonsfond_) or by the Government Social Security Fund (_Sosyal Guvenlik Fonu_), provided that such dividends are exempt from tax in the contracting state where the beneficial owner is a resident.
  9. The treaty-reduced rate of 5% shall apply if such dividends are exempt from tax in the contracting state of which the beneficial owner is a resident.
  10.

## WHT on interest and royalties

Interest paid to non-residents is subject to 10% WHT under local legislation. The WHT rates set out in the DTTs that Turkey has signed are mostly equal to (or higher than) the local rate. A reduction in the WHT rate further to a DTT is possible only in very limited situations.

Capital gains derived by a company are generally taxable as ordinary corporate income. However, 50% of capital gains derived from the sale of domestic participations is exempt from CIT where: 
  * The participation has been held for at least two years.
  * The gains are kept in a special fund account under shareholders' equity for five years following the year of the sale.
  * The exempt gains are not transferred within the specified period to another account (except for transfers to the capital account by way of capital contribution).
  * The consideration for the sale is collected by the end of the second calendar year following the year of the sale.
  * The company does not hold the participation for the purpose of an ordinary business involving the trading of participations.


A 25% exemption applies to capital gains derived from the sale of immovable property that has been held for at least two years, provided that the immovable property was acquired before 15 July 2023. 
Capital gains derived by a Turkish international holding company from the sale of foreign participation are exempt from CIT, provided the foreign participation has been held for at least two years. To qualify as an international holding company, a Turkish company must meet the following requirements:
  * It must be a corporation.
  * At least 75% of its total assets (excluding cash items) must be comprised of foreign participations that have been held for a continuous period of at least one year.
  * It must hold at least 10% of the capital of each foreign participation.
  * The foreign participation must be in the form of a corporation or limited liability company.


## Dividend income
Dividends received by a resident company from another Turkish company are exempt from CIT in the hands of the shareholder. Dividends received from a non-resident company are fully exempt from CIT where:
  * The non-resident payer is a corporation or limited liability company.
  * The Turkish recipient has owned at least 10% of the paid-in capital of the payer for at least one year.
  * The profits out of which the dividends are paid were subject to foreign income tax of at least 15%.
  * The dividends are remitted to Turkey by the date the CIT return is due.


In addition, the recently introduced law number 7491 has brought tax exemption on 50% of the dividends from non-resident companies. The only requirements to benefit from the 50% exemption are:
  * a minimum holding of 50% in the share capital of the foreign company, and
  * the dividends must be remitted to Turkey by the date the CIT return is due.


Turkish companies that previously could not benefit from the full tax exemption (i.e. because the foreign subsidiary did not meet the requirement of being subject to 15% taxation) now may have possibility to claim a partial (50%) exemption on their dividend income from foreign companies.
## Interest income
In principle, all interest income is subject to tax. Interest income on bank deposits denominated in both Turkish lira and foreign currency is subject to WHT. Interest income is recorded at gross, and any WHT incurred on this income is offset against CIT calculated.
## Royalty income
Royalty income derived by a Turkish company is taxable as ordinary corporate income. 
## Foreign-sourced income
In principle, foreign-sourced income is taxable in Turkey. However, foreign-sourced dividend income may be subject to participation exemption if certain conditions are met (_see Dividend income above_). 
Other foreign-sourced income, such as royalties and interest, is fully taxable in Turkey. Partial relief from taxation is granted insofar as the foreign tax paid does not exceed the rate of tax payable for the same income in Turkey.
Although undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries should not be taxable in Turkey, controlled foreign company (CFC) rules should also be taken into consideration in this respect. _See Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in the section for more information_.

## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 02 May 2024
In Turkey, companies (other than those in the financial sector) are subject to a standard CIT rate of 25%. For financial sector companies, the CIT rate is 30%.
The taxable income of a company is computed based on its net accounting profits after adjustment for exemptions and deductions and including prior-year losses carried forward, to a limited extent.
Resident entities are subject to tax on their worldwide income, whereas non-resident entities are taxed only on their Turkish-sourced income. 
## Minimum CIT rule
With effect from 1 January 2025, a domestic minimum tax regime is applicable that aims to ensure the corporate tax is not less than 10% of corporate income before certain exemptions and deductions. Under the new rule, the corporate taxpayers will compute their tax liability under both the standard tax regime (i.e. 25% tax on taxable income after deductions and exemptions) and a parallel regime (i.e. 10% tax on taxable income before certain deductions and exemptions). The larger amount will then be payable. 
Certain exemption items are excluded from the base for the 10% tax (In other words, these specific exemptions will not be added to the base for the 10% tax). These exemptions include:
  * Participation exemption for dividends from Turkish resident entities
  * Exemption for emission premiums
  * Exemption provided under the Law on Technology Development Zone
  * Allowances granted for qualifying R&D and design activities


## Local income taxes
There are no provincial or municipal taxes on corporate income in Turkey.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
Deliveries of goods and services are subject to VAT at rates varying from 1% to 20%. The general rate is 20%.
VAT payable on local purchases and on imports is regarded as 'input VAT', and VAT calculated and collected on sales is considered 'output VAT'. Input VAT is offset against output VAT in the VAT return filed at the related tax office. If output VAT is in excess of input VAT, the excess amount is paid to the related tax office. Conversely, if input VAT exceeds output VAT, the balance is carried forward to the following months to be offset against future output VAT. With the exception of a few situations, such as exportation and sales to an investment incentive holder, there is no cash refund to recover excess input VAT.
Turkish VAT principles contain a 'reverse-charge VAT mechanism', which requires the calculation of VAT by resident entities on payments to persons in foreign countries. Under this mechanism, VAT is calculated and paid to the related tax office by the resident entity. The resident entity treats this VAT as input VAT and offsets it in the same month. This VAT does not create a tax burden for the resident or non-resident entity, except for its cash flow effect on the former if there is insufficient output VAT to offset the input VAT.
VAT is also collected at the point of import. The VAT rate is the same rate as the one that is applied for transactions in the country of origin. The base for VAT is the value of the goods for customs tax purposes plus any kind of tax payable at the point of import and all the expenses incurred until the single administrative document is registered.
### Reduced rates
For the deliveries and services mentioned in List No. I (e.g. agricultural products such as raw cotton, dried hazelnuts, supply and leasing of goods within the scope of the Finance Leasing Law), the reduced rate is 1%.
For the deliveries and services mentioned in List No. II (e.g. basic food stuffs, textiles, books and similar publications), the reduced rate is 10%.
### Foreign trade: Imports and exports
Importation of goods and services is a taxable transaction, whether or not the importation is made for business purposes. Export transactions are exempt from VAT, and credit and refund is available for input VAT for the export goods.
### Importation of goods and services
For VAT purposes, any importation of goods or services into Turkey is a taxable transaction, regardless of the status of the importer or the nature of the transaction. To equalise the tax burden on importation and domestic supply of goods and services, VAT is levied only on the importation of goods and services that are liable to tax within Turkey. Accordingly, any transaction exempt in Turkey may also be exempt on import. The VAT on importation is imposed at the same rates applicable to the domestic supply of goods and services. In the case of importation, the taxable event occurs at the time of actual importation. Importation of machinery and equipment under an investment incentive certificate (IIC) is exempt from VAT.
## Banking and insurance transactions tax (BITT)
The transactions being performed by licensed banks and insurance companies are generally exempt from VAT but are subject to BITT at a rate of 5% in general (although some transactions are subject to 1% or 0% BITT), which is due on the gains of such corporations from their transactions.
The purchase of goods and services by banks and insurance companies are subject to VAT, but this is considered an expense or cost item. Therefore, it is not recoverable (i.e. for VAT purposes by offsetting against the output VAT) in the hands of these corporations.
## Special consumption tax
There are four main product groups that are subject to special consumption tax at different tax rates, depending on the GTIP numbers (tariff numbers):
  * Petroleum products, natural gas, lubricating oil, solvents, and derivatives of solvents.
  * Automobiles and other vehicles, motorcycles, planes, helicopters, yachts.
  * Tobacco and tobacco products, alcoholic beverages.
  * Luxury products.


Unlike VAT, which is applied on each delivery, special consumption tax is charged only once (except for some activities, such as production).
## Customs and foreign trade
Following the changes in Turkish economic policy in the 1980s, there has been rapid growth in the foreign trade volume of Turkey.
Turkey is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Customs Organization (WCO). Turkey signed the ‘Decision No:1/95 on Implementation of the Customs Union’ with the European Union on 1 January 1996 and has amended its customs code and legislation in line with those of the EU customs code.
According to the Customs Union, with the exception of certain goods (e.g. agricultural and steel products), no customs tax is incurred on trade between Turkey and the European Union as long as the goods are imported to Turkey with an A.TR Movement Certificate proving that the goods are in free circulation in the European Union.
In order to harmonise its foreign trade, Turkey has also signed several Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the trade partners of the European Union.
The Turkish Customs Code is very similar to that of the EU, and its aim is to harmonise the customs practices of Turkey with EU customs practices.
The Turkish Customs Code defines the ‘Turkish Customs Territory’ as the territory of the Republic of Turkey including the territorial waters, the inland maritime zone, and the airspace of Turkey.
The Turkish Customs Code has also brought into force the customs regimes with economic impact that have been in use in the EU countries for a long time. The import taxes, VAT, other taxes, and funds are collected at the time of importation. The main tax collected at customs is the import tax. The import tax differs according to the classification of the commodity and to the country of origin.
VAT is also collected at the point of import. The VAT rate is the same rate as the one that is applied for the transactions in the country of origin. The base for VAT is the value of the goods for customs tax purposes plus any kind of tax payable at the point of import and all the expenses incurred until the single administrative document is registered.
The VAT rates are 1%, 8%, and 18%, varying according to the type of goods imported.
In addition, if the import transaction is not conducted in cash, there is a special Resource Utilisation Support Fund (RUSF), which should also be paid during importation. RUSF is a special kind of fund applied to importations on a credit basis. According to the RUSF legislation, any importation conducted on credit (if the payment related to the importation is not paid before the actual importation) is subject to a special payment of 6% of the value of the goods to be imported. The important criteria are payment term and whether it is a cash payment or payment on credit.
Dumping and anti-dumping duties are collected at the point of import.
In certain cases, such as temporary importation or inward processing, the customs administration shall require a kind of guarantee letter to secure the taxes. The amount of this guarantee shall cover all the taxes payable in the case of an importation.
There is no customs tax on trade between the EU and Turkey except for certain products (e.g. agricultural and steel products). However, it is crucial that the imported goods are imported together with anA.TRMovement Certificate proving that the goods are in free circulation.
In the case of FTAs, the goods must be imported with a EUR.1 certificate, giving proof of their country of origin in order to benefit from the FTA.
Turkey applies the Common Customs Tariff of the EU to third countries, except for agricultural and steel products.
## Property taxes
Buildings and land owned in Turkey are subject to an annual real estate tax at different rates.
## Stamp tax
Stamp tax applies to a wide range of documents, including, but not limited to, agreements, financial statements, and payrolls. Stamp tax is levied as a percentage of the value stated on the agreements at rates varying between 0.189% and 0.948%.
Salary payments are subject to stamp tax at a rate of 0.759% over the gross amounts, whereas a lump-sum stamp tax is calculated for certain types of documents, such as the printed copies of the financial statements.
## Resource Utilisation Support Fund (RUSF)
According to the current legislation, regressive RUSF rates apply to foreign exchange and gold borrowings provided to Turkish residents (banks and financing institutions are exempt) from abroad depending on the maturity.
The RUSF rates on foreign currency denominated loans are as follows:
  * 3% if the maturity is under one year.
  * 1% if the maturity is between one and two years (including one year).
  * 0.5% if the maturity is between two and three years (including two years).
  * 0% if the maturity is three or more than three years (including three years).


The RUSF rates on Turkish lira denominated loans are as follows:
  * 1% if the maturity is under one year.
  * 0% if the maturity is one or more than one year (including one year).


Moreover, RUSF bases differ based on the type and the currency of the loan. RUSF is calculated:
  * Over the principal amount in case the loan is foreign exchange denominated.
  * Over the interest payments in case the loan is Turkish lira denominated.


## Payroll taxes
In accordance with the Turkish tax regulations, all employees working under a resident employer are included into the local payroll. The employer withholds taxes and other duties on income at source, and the employees receive the net amount after the deductions. The income tax and the stamp tax should be declared by the employers filing the withholding tax return. _The tax tables applicable to individuals are provided in the section of Turkey’s Individual tax summary_.
The social security premiums and the unemployment premiums should be declared by the employers filing the social security premium declaration on a monthly basis.
Income tax, stamp tax, social security premiums, and unemployment premiums are the legal deductions from the salary.
## Social security premiums
As of 1 January 2025, social security premiums for both the employer and the employee are 34.75% in total, of an employee’s salary; 14% for the employee and 20.75% for the employer. In addition to social security payments, unemployment contribution is 3% of the salary; 1% for the employee and 2% for the employer.
The social security ceiling is determined as 195.041,40 Turkish lira (TRY) as of 1 January 2025.
