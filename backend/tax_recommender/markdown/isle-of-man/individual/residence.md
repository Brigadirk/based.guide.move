## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Generally, a person present on the Island for six months or more in the tax year is regarded as resident. However, individuals may be judged to be resident with less than six monthsâ€™ presence in one year, depending on such factors as the maintenance of a home available for their use on the Island and the frequency and purpose of their visits to the Island and abroad.
