## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Deductions are available to individuals only for the actual expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in acquiring the income on which income tax is payable. This might include professional subscriptions and travel expenses where an individual is employed and other costs incurred in the normal course of business where the individual is self-employed.
For employees, the expense of travelling to and from work is not deductible.
Self-employed individuals may also be eligible to claim relief for certain capital expenditure incurred as outlined in the _section in the Corporate tax summary_.
## Personal deductions
Deductible non-business expenses include the following:
  * Interest paid by a resident on any mortgage or loan, provided, in most cases, that the lending institution is based in the Isle of Man. If interest is paid at more than a reasonable commercial rate, the excess is not deductible. The maximum amount of interest for which relief can be claimed is IMP 5,000 _per annum_. This amount is doubled in the case of a married couple or civil partners who have chosen to be jointly assessed, but the relief is restricted to 10%.
  * Pension contributions paid to approved schemes.
  * Donations to charities exceeding IMP 100 up to a limit of IMP 7,000 _per annum_ and certain covenanted educational payments up to IMP 5,500 _per annum_. These reliefs are restricted to 10%.


## Standard deductions
There are no standard or flat rate deductions.
