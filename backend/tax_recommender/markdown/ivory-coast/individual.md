## Personal income tax rates
### Tax on salaries and wages
Taxes on salaries and wages, pensions, and life annuities payable by employees have been reformed through Ordinance No. 2023-718 of 13 September 2023. The broad outlines of these reforms are as follows:
  * Merger of the three schedular taxes (salary tax [IS], national contribution [CN], and general income tax [IGR]) into a single tax: tax on salaries and wages.
  * Adoption of progressive taxation instead of mixed taxation (proportional and progressive).
  * Adoption of a single scale compared to the two scales previously applied (CN and IGR).
  * Adoption of a system of progressive tax rates per salary bracket.
  * The establishment of a tax reduction mechanism for family responsibilities in substitution for the family quotient to take said expenses into account, depending on the marital status of the employee. See Personal allowances in the Deductions section for more information.
  * Maintaining the number of shares in force, ranging from 1 to 5.


### Progressive tax scale by salary bracket
The tax on salaries and wages is now calculated on the gross amount of the salary and according to a monthly progressive scale per bracket to which a determined rate is applied. This scale allows the gross tax to be calculated as follows:
Monthly income brackets (XOF*) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 75,000 | 0  
75,000 | 240,000 | 16  
240,000 | 800,000 | 21  
800,000 | 2,400,000 | 24  
2,400,000 | 8,000,000 | 28  
8,000,000 | 32  
_*_ Communauté financière d'Afrique (Financial Community of Africa or CFA) francs
The formula to apply to directly obtain the amount of the monthly gross tax is as follows:
R = Taxable income
Taxable monthly salary bracket (XOF) | Gross tax amount  
---|---  
0 to 75,000 | 0  
75,001 to 240,000 | R x 16% - 12,000  
240,001 to 800,000 | R x 21% - 24,000  
800,001 to 2,400,000 | R x 24% - 48,000  
2,400,001 to 8,000,000 | R x 28% - 144,000  
Above 8,000,000 | R x 32% - 464,000

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Taxable period
The taxable period in Côte d’Ivoire is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Employers must calculate and withhold taxes due by employees, and they must file monthly returns for both employee tax and the employer’s payroll tax. Adjustment declarations are filed annually by 30 June for companies subject to audit requirements and 30 May for the others.
Employees are not required to file and pay the payroll tax when their employer is not in the country.
A husband and wife are taxed separately. The husband’s salary is taxed with regard to the relevant tax reduction for dependants (marriage and children). Employed women are also taxed with regard to the same deductions for dependants (marriage and children) as their husbands'. 
## Payment of tax
Taxes, including withholding taxes (WHTs), are remitted by the entities registered with the _’Direction des Grandes Entreprises_ ’ and '_Direction des Moyennes Entreprises'_ of the Tax Administration by the 10th day of each month for the preceding month for industrial, mining, and oil companies, the 15th day of each month for sales companies, and the 20th day of each month for service providers. For entities registered with the other tax offices, the deadline is the 15th day of each month.
For very small size taxpayers (_taxe d'etat de l'entreprenant_), the filing and payment is due by the 10th day of each month.
The payment is due at the same date for small size taxpayers subject to the micro-enterprise tax regime (_régime de la microentreprise_).

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
## Employment expenses
Deduction for employment expenses has been abolish by the reform of tax on salaries and wages and is replaced by the tax reduction measure for family expenses (_see below_).
## Personal deductions
Although the deduction of specific non-business expenses is permitted under tax law, the practice rarely is used since the results usually are less favourable than the result from taking the the tax reduction measure for family expenses (_see below_).
## Standard deductions
The standard deduction was removed under the reform of tax on salaries and wages.
## Personal allowances
### Tax reduction scale for dependants (RICF)
The reform of tax on salaries and wages provides for a tax reduction to take into account family responsibilities (RICF) to replace the family quotient system provided for by the previous device.
This reduction, attributable to the amount of gross tax determined according to the progressive tax scale (_see the section_), depends on the number of shares and makes it possible to calculate the net tax payable by the employee.
The tax reduction scale for dependants is as follows:
Number of shares | Tax reduction scale for dependants (XOF monthly amount)  
---|---  
1.0 | 0  
1.5 | 5,500  
2.0 | 11,000  
2.5 | 16,500  
3.0 | 22,000  
3.5 | 27,500  
4.0 | 33,000  
4.5 | 38,500  
5.0 | 44,000  
Retired people aged over 70 benefit from reduction of 75% of the calculated tax after application of the tax reduction for family responsibilities.
The number of shares to be taken into account for the determination of the tax reduction for family responsibilities is fixed as follows:
Marital status | Number of shares  
---|---  
Single, divorced, or widower without dependent children | 1.0  
Married without dependent children | 2.0  
Single or divorced, having a dependent child | 2.0  
Married or widowed with a dependent child | 2.5  
Single or divorced, having two dependent children | 2.5  
Married or widowed with two dependent children | 3.0  
Single or divorced, having three dependent children | 3.0  
Married or widowed with three dependent children | 3.5  
Single or divorced, having four dependent children | 3.5  
The number of shares is increased by one half point per dependent child. This increase is increased to one point per dependent minor or adult infirm.
However, the number of shares to take into consideration for the reduction of the tax may in no case exceed five.
