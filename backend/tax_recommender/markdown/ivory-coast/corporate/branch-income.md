## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 November 2024
The tax rate for branch income is the same as that for corporate income. After-tax branch earnings are subject to a 15% tax (_Impôt sur le revenu des valeurs mobilières_ or IRVM) calculated on 50% of the taxable profit. This is analogous to the WHT on dividends.
