## Customs duties
Customs duties rates range from 0% to 35%, depending on the classification of the imported goods according to the customs tariff.
Upon import, goods are also subject to the statistical duty (1%), to the community solidarity levy (0.8%), to African Union import tax (0.2%), to community levy (0.5%), and to VAT (18%).
Special taxes, depending on the nature of the imported goods, may apply, such as excise duties.
