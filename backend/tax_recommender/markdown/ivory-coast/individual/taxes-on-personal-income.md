## Personal income tax rates
### Tax on salaries and wages
Taxes on salaries and wages, pensions, and life annuities payable by employees have been reformed through Ordinance No. 2023-718 of 13 September 2023. The broad outlines of these reforms are as follows:
  * Merger of the three schedular taxes (salary tax [IS], national contribution [CN], and general income tax [IGR]) into a single tax: tax on salaries and wages.
  * Adoption of progressive taxation instead of mixed taxation (proportional and progressive).
  * Adoption of a single scale compared to the two scales previously applied (CN and IGR).
  * Adoption of a system of progressive tax rates per salary bracket.
  * The establishment of a tax reduction mechanism for family responsibilities in substitution for the family quotient to take said expenses into account, depending on the marital status of the employee. See Personal allowances in the Deductions section for more information.
  * Maintaining the number of shares in force, ranging from 1 to 5.


### Progressive tax scale by salary bracket
The tax on salaries and wages is now calculated on the gross amount of the salary and according to a monthly progressive scale per bracket to which a determined rate is applied. This scale allows the gross tax to be calculated as follows:
Monthly income brackets (XOF*) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 75,000 | 0  
75,000 | 240,000 | 16  
240,000 | 800,000 | 21  
800,000 | 2,400,000 | 24  
2,400,000 | 8,000,000 | 28  
8,000,000 | 32

The formula to apply to directly obtain the amount of the monthly gross tax is as follows:
R = Taxable income
Taxable monthly salary bracket (XOF) | Gross tax amount  
---|---  
0 to 75,000 | 0  
75,001 to 240,000 | R x 16% - 12,000  
240,001 to 800,000 | R x 21% - 24,000  
800,001 to 2,400,000 | R x 24% - 48,000  
2,400,001 to 8,000,000 | R x 28% - 144,000  
Above 8,000,000 | R x 32% - 464,000
