The employees only pay 6.3% for the CNPS Retirement Fund and the employer pays 7.7% of the taxable salary to the CNPS Retirement Fund (total 14%). The other contributions are paid by the employer (i.e. family allowances 5.75%, work injury from 2% to 5%).

## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is a non-cumulative tax levied on the sale of goods and services at the rate of 18%. _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Luxury and excise taxes
Excise duties apply on cigarette imports, alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages, oil products, and perfume and cosmetics products.
## Payroll taxes
Taxes are levied at the rates of 2.8% for local employees and 12% for expatriate employees on the total taxable remuneration, including salaries, benefits, and benefits in kind.
With the removal of the 20% reduction on gross remuneration paid, as part of the salary tax reform, the above-mentioned usage rates are directly applied to the gross base for the calculation of the employer contribution.
