## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 02 December 2024
Greenlandic PEs of foreign companies, and taxable income connected to oil, gas, and mineral activities, are taxed under the same rules and rates as Greenlandic resident companies. There is no branch profits remittance tax or other similar tax on branch profits. As a branch is considered to be the same legal entity as the headquarters, interest paid from the branch to the headquarters is not tax deductible.
Unusually, if one foreign company has more than one location or PE in Greenland, these are treated as separate taxable entities with no possibility of consolidation.
