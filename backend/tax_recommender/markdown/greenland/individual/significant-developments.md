On 1 January 2016, an amendment was adopted to the expat flat-tax regime that applies to individuals working in the extractive industries or involved in construction and installation outside existing towns and settlements.
The amendment states that such individuals are not tax liable on interest and dividends from sources outside Greenland, provided that the individual earns less than 350,000 Danish kroner (DKK) per income year from the employment that gives rise to Greenlandic tax liability. If there is no other income, such individuals are exempt from the duty to file a tax return.
The purpose of the amendment is to avoid unnecessary administration in connection with tax returns for taxpayers and the tax authority alike in a situation where there is unlikely to be tax revenue of any significance at stake.
