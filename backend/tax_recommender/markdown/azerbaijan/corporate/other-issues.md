Information on transactions carried out through the accounts of VAT-registered taxpayers should be submitted by the banks to the respective executive authority by the 10th day of each month.

## Risky taxpayers and transaction without substance
A non-commodity transaction is an operation discovered in the course of tax control and is formalised to generate profit without the provision of goods, works, and services.
The Law envisages the following with regards to the taxation of risky taxpayers:
  * Information about risky taxpayers is not to be considered as a trade secret.
  * The tax authority has the right to perform an extraordinary tax audit and operative tax control.
  * Extension of period for refund of the overpaid tax from the state budget without consideration of the full completion of the operative tax control.


For profit tax purposes, the value of goods delivered by risky taxpayers will be calculated based on the market price and related information.
