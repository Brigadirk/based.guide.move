If a resident enterprise or a PE of a non-resident receives interest, royalties, or rental fees taxable at the source of payment in Azerbaijan, it is entitled to consider the tax deducted from the source of payment, provided that the documents supporting the tax deduction are in place.
Direct or indirect payments to a person in a country with a favourable tax regime are considered income from an Azerbaijani source and subject to 10% WHT. The list of countries concerned is determined annually (_see Foreign income in the section for a link to the list_).

Moreover, local banks, branches of a foreign banks in the Republic of Azerbaijan, or national postal operators shall be required to withhold tax at the source of payment when individuals who are not registered with the tax authority are making payments to countries or territories subject to preferential taxation.

New rules on administration of double tax treaties (DTTs) are effective as of 1 July 2017. The following amendments are established:
  * Advance tax relief may be obtained for all type of income, including business (active income) if such income is not attributable to a PE in Azerbaijan. Previously, such relief might only be obtained for dividends, interest, royalties, and income from international shipments.
  * Applications may also be filed electronically along with a hard-copy submission. Previously, only hard-copy submission was possible.
  * No requirement to get respective DTT application approved by the overseas tax authorities. Only a tax residency certificate is required to be approved by the foreign tax authorities.
  * Tax office may also return the approved applications to the income payer (tax agents) in the online regime.


More detailed information about applicability of lower rates may be found in respective DTTs.
