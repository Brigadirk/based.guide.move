## Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s)/G20’s Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
In December 2022, Azerbaijan joined the OECD’s/G20’s Inclusive Framework on BEPS.
By joining the OECD’s/G20’s Inclusive Framework on BEPS, Azerbaijan, together with another 135 countries and jurisdictions, has taken on the commitment to implement 15 measures to tackle tax avoidance, improve the consistency of international tax rules, and ensure a more transparent tax environment.
Some of the Action Plans have already been fully or partially adopted into Azerbaijan’s tax legislation, such as controlled foreign company (CFC), permanent establishment (PE), transfer pricing, and country-by-country (CbC) reporting provisions.
Through joining the OECD’s/G20’s Inclusive Framework on BEPS, Azerbaijan has committed to addressing tax challenges arising from the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy by joining a two-pillar plan to reform the international taxation rules to make multinational enterprises pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate.
## New tax incentives
Beginning from 2023, a new tax incentives regime has been created for the legal entities and sole entrepreneurs operating in the liberated territories.
## Exemptions for IT companies
Companies involved in system integration, software preparation, and development activities (so-called ‘IT companies’), beginning from 2023, can benefit from certain profit tax exemptions.

Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Azerbaijan is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Resident enterprises and PEs of non-residents must file profit tax returns for a calendar year by 31 March of the following year. During liquidation of a legal entity or a PE of a non-resident, the tax return should be submitted within 30 days after the adoption of a decree on liquidation.
A non-resident that has no PE in Azerbaijan and receives income subject to WHT (except for dividends and interest) may file a tax return with respect to such income and expenses, connected with the generation of the income, for purposes of reassessment of profit tax at the rate of 20%.
If a taxpayer applies for an extension of time to file the profit tax return prior to the expiration of the filing deadline and at the same time settles the full tax amount due, the filing deadline may be prolonged for up to three months. The prolongation of the terms for filing the return will not modify the terms of tax payment.
Legal entities and entrepreneurs that withhold tax at the source of payment are obligated to file the WHT report with the tax authorities within 20 days following the end of the quarter.
## Advance tax ruling
The Tax Code introduces the concept of advance tax ruling, which allows a taxpayer to apply to the tax office for determination of its tax liabilities and legal consequences in advance for taxable operations. A tax ruling can be obtained for a particular transaction of at least AZN 10 million. The state duty for such application is AZN 500.
## Voluntary tax disclosure
Voluntary tax disclosure refers to situations where notification of a tax liability, not discovered during a field tax audit, is made by the taxpayer to the tax authorities after the audit. In this case, the taxpayer pays only the tax due (i.e. without payment of a financial sanction).
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers must make advance quarterly tax payments of profit tax by the 15th day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter. Payments are determined either (i) as 25% of tax for the past fiscal year or (ii) by multiplying the amount of actual income through the quarter by a ratio of tax to gross income for the previous year.
The final payment of profit tax coincides with submission of the declaration of profit tax (i.e. 31 March).
## Tax audit process
The ordinary on-site tax audit shall be conducted not more than once in a year.
Off-site tax inspection shall be conducted within 30 working days from the date when a tax return is provided by the taxpayer to the tax office. After the mentioned term expires, off-site tax inspection is not allowed for the tax return.
An extraordinary tax audit may be performed at any time under the following conditions:
  * If the tax reporting documents required for the calculation and payment of tax are not submitted within the specified period and after notification of the tax authority.
  * If incorrect information is found in the report made on the results of tax inspection.
  * When overpaid amount of VAT, interest, and financial sanction is assigned for the payment of other taxes, interests, and financial sanctions or assigned as payments on future liabilities. In such cases, the scope of the extraordinary tax audit is limited only to the taxable VAT operations of the taxpayer.
  * When application is submitted by the taxpayer to return overpaid amounts of tax, interests, and financial sanctions.
  * When the tax authorities obtain information from a known source on hiding (decreasing) of incomes or object of taxation by the taxpayer.
  * When, in accordance with criminal legislation, there is a decision of the court or law-enforcement agency on implementation of a tax audit.
  * In case of failure to provide the documents specified in the Tax Code.
  * In the event of application for liquidation, reorganisation of the taxpayer legal entity, or seizure of business operations of the natural person operating without formation of a legal entity.
  * If taxpayer is considered to be a risky taxpayer.


Additionally, an extraordinary tax audit may be conducted in the following cases, covering the period inspected by the previous on-site tax audit:
  * If taxpayers who do not agree with the results of the tax audit request to conduct an extraordinary on-site tax audit.
  * If the taxpayer fails to submit documents during the on-site tax audit and the decision on the results of the tax audit is appealed to the higher tax authority by submitting the said documents.
  * When the decision of the tax authority is appealed to the higher tax authority by submitting documents different from the documents submitted by the taxpayer during the on-site tax inspection.


## Statute of limitations
Tax authorities are entitled to calculate and recalculate taxes, penalties, and financial sanctions of the taxpayer within three years after termination of the taxable reporting period and to impose calculated (recalculated) sums of taxes, penalties, and financial sanctions within five years after termination of the taxable reporting period.
In case the relevant executive authorities of foreign countries have provided information on income derived abroad, tax audits may cover a period of five years preceding the date of decision of the tax authority to conduct the audit.
There is no limitation in case of criminal investigation and cash claim of overpaid taxes.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
The main issues challenged by the tax authorities during a tax audit include, but are not limited to, the following:
  * Disallowance of offset of VAT on temporary import.
  * Challenging the secondment structure.
  * Application of the 20% profit tax on 'deemed profit'.
  * Taxes withheld on payments to non-resident suppliers in cases where income of non-residents is considered as Azerbaijani-source income.
  * Application of VAT on market price of assets that were written off, disposed free of charge, or at a discount rate.
  * Challenging the transfer pricing.
  * Deductibility of the head office costs.
  * Deduction of management services.
  * Deduction of royalties.

## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
A resident enterprise is any legal entity established in accordance with the legislation of Azerbaijan and performing entrepreneurial activity or any entity that is effectively managed in Azerbaijan.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE of a foreign legal entity is subject to taxation with respect to the income attributable to such PE. A PE is an establishment of a foreign legal entity, through which it fully or partially performs commercial activities (for these purposes, a PE may be considered a management unit, office bureau, agency, construction site, etc.) for 90 cumulative days or more within any 12-month period.
Activities of an auxiliary or preparatory nature, such as the following, do not create a PE:
  * Storing and demonstration of goods and products belonging to a non-resident enterprise.
  * Storing stocks of goods or products belonging to a non-resident enterprise for eventual processing and subsequent export from the Republic of Azerbaijan by a third party.
  * Any other preparatory or auxiliary activity for a non-resident enterprise itself.
  * Purchase of goods or gathering information for a non-resident enterprise’s own needs.
  * Joint implementation of any of the above-stated activities.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above-stated activities (auxiliary and preparatory) shall be considered as creating a PE if:
  * the joint implementation of those activities by a non-resident and its interdependent persons in the Republic of Azerbaijan are for entrepreneurial purposes or
  * the results of a coherent implementation of any of those activities are not of a preparatory or auxiliary nature, and/or
  * the activities of such persons are complementary to other activities as part of a single business process.


Moreover, according to the PE Amendments to the Tax Code, persons authorised to compile a customer base and organise work with clients for non-residents are also deemed to constitute a PE, considering the time threshold prescribed above.

Annual depreciation is calculated as a pro-rata amount based on the actual remaining duration of the lease agreement if the lease agreement’s term is more than five years. If the lease duration is less than five years, 20% of the total leasehold improvement per year.


## Goodwill
Azerbaijani tax legislation does not specify the definition of goodwill.
## Tax basis of assets
The tax basis of assets includes expenses for their acquisition, production, construction, assembly, and installation, as well as other expenses that increase their value, with the exception of expenses for which the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction.
## Interest expenses
Interest on loans received from overseas and/or from related parties may be deducted, limited to the interest rate on loans with similar currency and maturity at the interbank credit auction. In absence of such an auction, deductions for interest may not exceed rates of 125% of the interbank auction credit rates published by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan.
Beginning from 1 January 2019, thin capitalisation rules were introduced. Accrual interests on foreign borrowings exceeding two times equity will not be deductible for profit tax purposes (note that it is not applicable to banks and credit institutions).
## Bad debt
A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deduction for doubtful debts connected with goods, work, and services that have been realised where income from them was previously included in the gross income received from entrepreneurial activity. Doubtful debt deduction shall be allowed only if the debt is written off as worthless in the taxpayer’s books.
## Charitable contributions
Beginning from 1 January 2021, contributions not exceeding 10% of the profit of the reporting year, transferred to the funds created for public and social purposes, shall be exempt from tax for a period of eight years.
## Fines and penalties
No deduction is allowed for financial sanctions or interest calculated for delayed payment of taxes.
## Taxes
Property, land, and mining taxes are deductible.
## Other expenses deductible within certain limits
  * The amount of repair expenses deductible each year is limited to the amount of the tax written down value of each category of fixed assets as of the end of the previous year. For buildings and premises, the limit is 2%; for machinery and equipment, the limit is 5%; for trucks, the limit is 8%; and for other fixed assets, the limit is 3%. An amount exceeding these limits shall be taken as an increase of the residual balance value of the fixed assets in the appropriate category.
  * Actual business trip expenses are deductible from income within the limits established by the Cabinet of Ministers.
  * A legal entity engaged in insurance activities is entitled to deduct allocations to reserve insurance funds within the standards established by the legislation of Azerbaijan.
  * Banks and credit entities engaged in certain types of banking activities shall be entitled to deduct from income the amounts assigned for establishment of special reserve funds, depending on the classification of assets in compliance with legislation and in accordance with procedures established by the relevant executive authority.

## Non-deductible expenses
The following expenses are non-deductible:
  * Capital expenses (not directly deducted, but only through depreciation).
  * Expenses connected with non-commercial activity.
  * Social expenses and entertainment expenses of employees and their family members.


## Net operating losses
Taxable losses incurred by legal entities may be carried forward for five years to offset future taxable profit, without limitations. Carryback of losses is not possible.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Under the Tax Code, the transactions between related parties should comply with:
  * Transfer pricing rules (applicable to the cross-border transactions between related parties).
  * Market price (applicable to the in-country transactions between related parties, but also to some other transactions, e.g. export-import operations).


The Azerbaijan transfer pricing legislation requires that cross-border 'controlled' transactions between related parties be carried out at arm’s-length prices. In case transfer prices are not set at arm’s length, the Azerbaijani tax authorities have the right to adjust the taxpayers’ revenues and expenses so as to reflect the market value.
The substance of the market price is very similar to the transfer pricing.


# Azerbaijan
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
Each taxpayer is liable to fulfil one's own tax liabilities. Azerbaijani tax legislation does not have the concept of 'group taxation'.
## Transfer pricing
The Tax Code provides that relations between associated (interrelated) entities must be based on the arm's-length principle.
Interrelated persons, for the purposes of taxation, are natural and/or legal persons, relations between which might have direct effect on economic results of their activities or the activities of persons they represent.
According to the regulations approved by the Ministry of Taxes, transfer pricing is only applied for the purposes of corporate/personal income tax.
The following transactions are controlled:
  * A resident and a non-resident in a related-party relationship.
  * A PE of a non-resident and such non-resident or any representative office, branch office, or other unit of such non-resident in other countries.
  * A resident and/or a PE of a non-resident and persons established (registered) in a country with a favourable tax regime.
  * If the persons have carried out operations on products traded on international commodity exchanges.
  * If the total income of the resident during the tax year exceeded AZN 30 million and the share of the volume of transactions with a non-resident in total income (expenses) exceeds 30%.


For the purposes of comparability analysis, transfer price is determined based on one of the three transactional transfer pricing methods and two profit methods:
  * Comparable uncontrolled price method.
  * Resale price method.
  * Cost plus method.
  * Transactional net margin method.
  * Profit split method.


Where the value of the transactions per controlled party does not exceed AZN 500,000 and no filing requirement is applicable, the taxpayer is still required to follow the regulations in computing tax liability.
In determining transfer prices, the following databases may be used:
  * International or local exchange quotations.
  * Foreign trade statistics of the customs authorities.
  * Reports placed in reliable sources.
  * Databases of specialised agencies to which the tax office is subscribed, etc.


The regulations also set out provisions on transfer pricing dispute resolution and avoidance of double taxation, as well as provide relevant examples of each of the transfer pricing methods.
## Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
The concept of a multinational corporations has been recently introduced, and a corresponding reporting obligation has been established for these companies, which is effective from 1 January 2020.
Multinational corporations refer to the group of companies that are resident in two or more countries or a group of companies operating through their PEs. Multinational corporations include subsidiaries and affiliates of the enterprise, as well as branches and representative offices.
If the total income of such group of companies for the fiscal year exceeds the manat equivalent of 750 million euros (EUR), an enterprise, as well as a resident of Azerbaijan belonging to that group, is required to report using an appropriate template. This threshold is in reference to the information in the financial statements of that group.
## Thin capitalisation
The concept of thin capitalisation was newly introduced and became effective from 1 January 2019.
Accrual interests on foreign borrowings exceeding two times equity will not be deductible for profit tax purposes (note that this is not applicable to banks and credit institutions).
Additionally, the Tax Code provides that interest on loans received from overseas and/or from related parties may be deducted, limited to the interest rate on loans with similar currency and maturity at the interbank credit auction. In absence of such an auction, deductions for interest may not exceed rates of 125% of the interbank auction credit rates published by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
An enterprise registered in territories that are subject to preferential taxation and not resident in the Republic of Azerbaijan is considered a CFC under the following conditions, and its income is taxed in the Republic of Azerbaijan:
  * A person who is considered a resident of the Republic of Azerbaijan, together with an inter-related resident or non-resident, directly or indirectly, has the right to vote more than 50% in a foreign enterprise or more than 50% of its authorised capital or has the right to receive more than 50% of the profits of that foreign enterprise.
  * If the actual tax paid on the profit of the foreign enterprise is two times or more lower than the tax payable on that profit in accordance with the tax legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
  * If more than 30% of the annual income of the foreign enterprise consists of passive (non-entrepreneurial) income (i.e. royalties, interest income, income from financial leasing).


The notification on the CFC must be submitted to the tax authority within the period specified for in the income tax return.

## Compliance requirements for financial institutions
Provisions on tax monitoring by financial institutions were introduced to the Tax Code in December 2016. In accordance with international treaties on exchange of information, financial institutions must submit information about financial transactions in Azerbaijan to the competent authorities of foreign countries by submitting e-reports.
Information on transactions carried out through the accounts of VAT-registered taxpayers should be submitted by the banks to the respective executive authority by the 10th day of each month.

## Risky taxpayers and transaction without substance
A non-commodity transaction is an operation discovered in the course of tax control and is formalised to generate profit without the provision of goods, works, and services.
The Law envisages the following with regards to the taxation of risky taxpayers:
  * Information about risky taxpayers is not to be considered as a trade secret.
  * The tax authority has the right to perform an extraordinary tax audit and operative tax control.
  * Extension of period for refund of the overpaid tax from the state budget without consideration of the full completion of the operative tax control.


For profit tax purposes, the value of goods delivered by risky taxpayers will be calculated based on the market price and related information.

# Azerbaijan
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
In general, Azerbaijan resident entities are subject to a profit tax on their worldwide income. A non-resident enterprise operating in Azerbaijan through a PE must pay tax on the gross income generated from Azerbaijan sources, less any related deductions attributable to the PE. Gross income of a non-resident enterprise generated from Azerbaijan sources and not connected with a PE is taxed at the source of payment without any deductions allowed for expenses.
Domestic enterprises and PEs of non-residents are subject to profit tax at the flat rate of 20%.
Taxable profits are defined to be the difference between a taxpayer’s gross income and deductible expenses.
Gross income encompasses all revenues received by a taxpayer from all economic activities, unless the revenues are expressly exempted under the law.
Deductible expenses encompass all expenses that are incurred in the furtherance of a taxpayer's business activities, except for those determined as non-deductible under the Tax Code. _See the section for more information_.
## Simplified tax system
The Tax Code stipulates payment of taxes based on a simplified system for enterprises or sole entrepreneurs not registered as value-added tax (VAT) payers and whose cumulative gross revenue during any consecutive 12-month period is not more than 200,000 Azerbaijani manats (AZN). 
The following are some of the taxpayers’ categories not eligible to be classified as simplified taxpayers:
  * Persons who produce goods subject to excise duty and mandatory marking.
  * Non-state pension funds.
  * Public legal entities.
  * Persons selling gold, jewellery made from it and other household goods, as well as diamonds.
  * Persons selling fur products.
  * Persons engaged in wholesale trade.
  * Persons engaged in retail trade activities with turnover exceeding AZN 200,000 over a consecutive 12-month period.
  * Persons with a residual value of fixed assets owned at the beginning of the year more than AZN 1 million.
  * Companies with headcount over ten employees engaged in production.
  * Professional participants of the insurance market (except for insurance agents providing services under a mandatory insurance agreement).
  * Persons providing services to tax registered persons.
  * Persons engaged in licence-required activities.
  * Persons earning income from renting property and royalties.


Persons engaged in both wholesale and retail activities may choose to be simplified taxpayers unless the volume of transactions (other than non-operating income) to be executed by electronic invoices in a quarter does not exceed 30% of total trading operations.
Persons who provide services to non-tax-registered persons and tax-registered persons may choose to be simplified taxpayers if the portion of the revenue (other than non-operating income) in relation to services supplied to tax-registered persons does not exceed 30% of the total revenue for a quarter.
Persons engaged in building construction activities do not have right to be a simplified taxpayer, except for those who have commenced but have not completed their construction works by 1 January 2020.
Persons who are operators of sports betting games and sellers of sports betting games, as well as organisers of lotteries and sellers of lottery tickets, are considered to be simplified taxpayers irrespective of their turnover.
The simplified tax is imposed on gross revenue at a rate of 2%, whereas the simplified tax rate for enterprises rendering catering services with taxable transactions exceeding AZN 200,000 shall be at 8%.
A special rate of simplified tax is set for individuals selling residential and non-residential premises (except for premises of individuals where one has been residing for at least five years) at a fixed amount of AZN 15 per square metre multiplied by an applied coefficient. The applied coefficient is determined by regional executive authorities.
Special tax rates apply in relation to the income of sports betting operators and lottery organisers at 6% of the proceeds generated from the sale of tickets and income of sports betting and lottery ticket sellers and 4% of the commissions paid to them by the operators and lottery organisers.
Simplified tax is calculated at 1% for cash withdrawals by legal entities and sole traders.
## Other special corporate tax regimes
There are other tax regimes applicable under special agreements concluded between the Azerbaijan government and foreign oil companies: production sharing agreements (PSAs) and host government agreements (HGAs). The PSA and HGA regimes apply to all enterprises involved in these agreements, including foreign oil companies functioning as contractors and foreign service companies providing services to the contractor or the operating company.
There are 30 signed and ratified PSAs and two HGAs, each with its own separate tax regime. Each PSA and HGA is in force, published on the official website of the Ministry of Taxes (), and contains a tax article that outlines the tax regime for that particular agreement. While there are several similarities with respect to tax terms in the various PSAs, there are some differences, other than merely differing tax rates (e.g. taxation of foreign subcontractors) or reporting requirements. Additionally, tax protocols for each PSA and HGA, which provide specific guidance regarding the procedures for payment of taxes and filing of reports, are negotiated with the Ministry of Taxes and other executive authorities.
Under PSAs, PSA contractor parties and foreign subcontractors are subject to tax only on their corporate income. Contractor parties pay profit tax on income derived from hydrocarbon activities, and foreign subcontractors are subject to tax only on income from services and mark-up on goods supplied in Azerbaijan. Local subcontractors are subject to the statutory tax regime.
No corporate tax is applicable to HGA subcontractors. HGA participants pay tax only on their transportation income.
_See the section for a description of other tax incentives_.
## Local income taxes
Local income taxes are paid only by companies and organisations that are in the property of municipalities. Tax rates do not exceed 20% for profit taxpayers and 2% to 8% for simplified taxpayers.


# Azerbaijan
## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is levied on the supply of goods and services in Azerbaijan, and on the import of goods.
### VAT rates
The standard rate of VAT is 18%.
Zero rating applies to the following:
  * Exportation of goods and services.
  * Importation under the PSA and HGA regimes if the taxpayer obtains a VAT exemption certificate.
  * Importation of goods, the supply of goods, and the implementation of works and provision of services to grant recipients on the expense of financial aid (grants) received from abroad.
  * International and transit cargo and passenger transportation, as well as the supply of works and services directly connected with international and transit flights and freight forwarding services related to international and transit cargo transportation.
  * Investment of fixed assets in the form of shares in the charter fund (capital) of the enterprise (if the investment of fixed assets is not related to the acquisition of other property in exchange for it).
  * The supply of gold and other valuables to the Central Bank of Azerbaijan.


Apart from the zero-rated VAT, an exemption from VAT is applied to the specific transactions listed below:
  * Provision of financial services.
  * Sale of participation interests or shares of a legal entity.
  * Provision of paid educational services.
  * Investment of any property (other than fixed assets) in the form of share into the charter fund (capital) of an enterprise, with the exception of imported property (if the investment of property is not related to the acquisition of other property in exchange for it).


  * Imports of fixed assets being a subject-matter of leasing agreements.
  * Turnover of agricultural products producers (including by industrial process) for the sale of agricultural products produced by them for a 13-year period beginning from 1 January 2014.
  * Payment for rent or lease of aircraft and aircraft engines from non-residents of Azerbaijan who do not have a PE in Azerbaijan within the scope of this activity.


Industrial and technology equipment imported by taxpayers is exempt from VAT for the period of ten years since their registration as a resident of the industrial and technological park. The VAT exemption is also applicable to goods imported into special economic zones (excluding those that are subject to an excise tax). Additionally, certain categories of imported goods are exempt from VAT as defined by the Cabinet of Ministers.
### Taxable persons
Any person who is registered or is liable to register as a VAT payer is regarded as a taxable person.
Taxpayers are required to register for VAT if:
  * their cumulative taxable income exceeds AZN 200,000 for a consecutive 12-month period, or
  * the value of one taxable transaction exceeds AZN 200,000.


Payments to a non-resident person, who is not registered as a VAT payer, for e-commerce services and works are subject to VAT.
If a person, who is not registered for tax purposes, makes payment to a non-resident for such electronic services (excluding hotel and air ticket arrangement services), the local bank executing the payment should pay the VAT from funds of the buyer. Such paid VAT is not creditable.
### Taxable amount
The taxable base is established by starting with the value of the goods and services without adding the VAT amount, but including any customs duty and excise duty, if applicable.
The value of taxable imports consists of the value of the goods determined in accordance with the customs legislation and taxes and duties (other than VAT) to be paid upon importation to Azerbaijan.
The amount of VAT to be paid is the difference between the amount of VAT received on taxable supplies of goods and services (output VAT) and VAT paid on the purchase of goods and services necessary to generate taxable supplies of goods and services (input VAT).
Beginning from 1 January 2022, the trade mark-up applied in the wholesale and retail sale of agricultural products (local and foreign origin) will be subject to taxation for a period of three years.
The Cabinet of Ministers can grant exemptions for the import of goods and equipment used for production purposes or to provide advanced technology know-how. Such exemptions are granted for a specific period and in a specific area and can only be granted if it is impossible to satisfy the respective needs from local resources.
Beginning from 1 January 2022, royalty payments are subject to VAT if the user of the intellectual property (IP) rights is situated/registered in Azerbaijan.
### Taxable point
Beginning from 1 January 2020, recognition of taxable turnover for VAT purposes mainly has been shifted to the cash basis method.
As a rule, in monetary transactions (i.e. cash and non-cash settlements), the time of the taxable transactions is the date when payment was received by the taxpayer. Whereas the time of VATable non-monetary transactions, such as barter and in-kind transactions, as well as free-of-charge provision of goods, services, and works, will be considered the time when such non-monetary transactions are completed.
## Customs duties
The Customs Code sets out the rules governing all aspects of the regime, including:
  * The establishment of bonded warehouses and duty-free zones.
  * Temporary imports and the processing of foreign goods in Azerbaijan.
  * The procedures for the re-import and re-export of goods.


Azerbaijan has adopted the internationally accepted classification system for goods. The valuation procedures for customs purposes are determined in line with the general principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The rates of customs duties are contained in the list of customs duties for the goods to be imported to Azerbaijan. These _ad valorem_ customs duty rates vary between 0% and 15%, depending on the type of goods.
Full or partial relief from the duty on temporary imports (generally, for a period of up to one year) is also available.
Under the PSA regime, contractors, their agents, and subcontractors are entitled to import and re-export from Azerbaijan, free from any import duties and restrictions, goods used for hydrocarbon activities.
## Excise duties
Excise duties are imposed on motorcycles that must be state registered; tobacco products; alcoholic beverages; light vehicles; leisure and sports yachts; petroleum; lubricants; imported platinum, gold, jewellery, and other items made thereof; processed, sorted, framed, and fixed diamonds; imported fur and leather goods; energy drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), and electronic cigarettes.

The following operations are subject to excise duties:
  * Release of excise goods produced in Azerbaijan outside the premises of the building in which they were produced.

### Tax rates
The relevant executive authority shall determine rates of excise tax for excise goods imported into Azerbaijan (with the exception of light vehicles, leisure and sports yachts, and other floating transports stipulated for these purposes; platinum, gold, jewellery, and other items made thereof; and processed, sorted, framed, and fixed diamonds).
The following excise rates apply for the following items produced in Azerbaijan:
  * Food alcohol (including ethyl alcohol non-denatured with alcohol content of not less than 80%; ethyl alcohol non-denatured with alcohol content of less than 80%): AZN 4.8 per litre.

Excise rates on petroleum materials, light vehicles, leisure and sports yachts, and other floating transports stipulated for these purposes produced in the Azerbaijan Republic are established by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Excise rates for automobiles, yachts for rest and sport purposes, and other floating means serving the mentioned purposes and imported into the Azerbaijan Republic constitute AZN 0.30 to AZN 70 per cubic cm of engine volume.
## Property tax
Property tax is levied on both movable and immovable property owned by individuals and companies.
### Property tax rates
Property tax of legal entities is imposed on the average annual book value of the taxable property at the rate of 1%.
Property tax of physical persons is calculated based on the area of the building, and property tax rates will vary between AZN 0.1 and AZN 0.4 per square metre, depending on the location of the building (e.g. in Baku, the rate is AZN 0.4 per square metre).
In the residential areas, property tax is applied only to the area of the property exceeding 30 square metres. If the building is located in Baku, tax will be calculated applying coefficients (minimum 0.7 and maximum 1.5).
### Taxable persons

Tax payments are due within 15 days of the second month of each quarter. The payment should be 20% of the previous year property tax amount.
The tax on water and air transport means is estimated on 1 January each year by the tax offices based on data provided by the organisations responsible for registration of means of transport. The tax is assessed on the person named in the registration document.
When an asset changes ownership during the tax year, the tax liability is defined as the liability of the new owner.
## Land tax
Land tax is levied on Azerbaijan’s land resources that are in the possession of or used by individuals or companies.
### Land tax rates
Land tax is AZN 0.06 per unit for agricultural land used for intended purposes or not available for the intended purposes of irrigation, reclamation, and other farming reasons based on conventional units per hectare.
AZN 2 is calculated per 100 square metres of land considered for agricultural use but not used for that purpose.
The rate of land tax for industrial, construction, transport, telecommunications, trade and housing servicing, and other dedicated land varies from AZN 2 to AZN 20 per 100 square metres, depending on the purpose, size of land, and city or region where it is located.
### Taxable base
Land plots that are in possession of physical persons or companies or land plots leased or used on other grounds are subject to land tax. Exemptions apply to various types of land owned or used for public purposes by the state or other public authorities. The government may grant further tax exemptions and reliefs.
### Assessment and procedure of payment
Companies must compute the exact amount of the land tax each year on the basis of documents evidencing the title of ownership, possession, and use. The computation must be submitted to the tax authorities, and final payment must be made by 31 January of the following year. Estimated advance land tax payments are paid by enterprises in equal amounts no later than 15 August and 15 November. The amount of each payment is 1/2 of the amount of tax calculated in the previous tax year.
