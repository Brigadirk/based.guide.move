## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
As of 2017, an individual is a tax resident of Cyprus if one satisfies either the '183-day rule' or the '60-day rule' for the tax year. For earlier tax years only, the '183-day rule' is relevant for determining Cyprus tax residency.
The '183-day rule' for Cyprus tax residency is satisfied for individuals who spend more than 183 days in any one calendar year in Cyprus, without any further additional conditions/criteria being relevant.
The '60-day rule' for Cyprus tax residency is satisfied for individuals who, cumulatively, in the relevant tax year:
  * do not reside in any other single state for a period exceeding 183 days in aggregate
  * are not considered tax resident by any other state
  * reside in Cyprus for at least 60 days, and
  * have other defined Cyprus ties.


To satisfy the fourth criteria, the individual must carry out any business in Cyprus and/or be employed in Cyprus and/or hold an office (director) of a company tax resident in Cyprus at any time in the tax year, provided that such is not terminated during the tax year. Further, the individual must maintain in the tax year a permanent residential property in Cyprus that is either owned or rented by the individual.
For the purposes of both the '183-day rule' and the '60-day rule', days in and out of Cyprus are calculated as follows:
  * the day of departure from Cyprus counts as a day of residence outside Cyprus
  * the day of arrival in Cyprus counts as a day of residence in Cyprus
  * arrival and departure from Cyprus in the same day counts as one day of residence in Cyprus, and
  * departure and arrival in Cyprus in the same day counts as one day of residence outside Cyprus.
