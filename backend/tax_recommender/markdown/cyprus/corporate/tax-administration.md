## Taxable period
In Cyprus, the tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
Business organisations are required to prepare audited accounts based on generally accepted auditing standards. Tax returns are completed based on these accounts on a calendar-year basis.
### Electronic submission
Companies should be registered online and submit their annual tax returns electronically. The submission deadline for a given year is 31 March of the second year thereafter.
## Payment of tax
Corporate entities must pay provisional tax on the current year’s income. Such provisional tax payment is made in two equal instalments on 31 July and 31 December of the tax year. A final balancing payment must be made on or before 1 August of the following year on a self-assessment basis to bring the total payments of tax to the total actually due according to the tax return.
## Tax audit process
The Cyprus tax process is one of self-assessment. Following the filing of a tax return, the CTD has 6 years from the end of the relevant tax year to raise an enquiry (12 years in cases of established fraud or wilful default). These can range from simple information requests to detailed technical challenges over treatments adopted in the tax return.
Any enquiries are often conducted between the taxpayer and the CTD by exchange of information via correspondence and meetings. Where agreement cannot be reached, litigation may be necessary.
A taxpayer may also proactively request that the CTD review the company’s ‘open’ tax years if the taxpayer requires a tax clearance certificate (e.g. upon commencement of voluntary liquidation).
For companies in a tax-loss position per the self-assessment return, the CTD is not restricted to the above-mentioned six-year (or 12-year) period; however, outside of this period, any adjustments may only reduce or nullify a loss.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Tax authorities generally focus on the tax statements being computed based on generally accepted auditing standards prepared and audited financial statements and on the principles of taxation as per the tax laws and their issued circulars.
