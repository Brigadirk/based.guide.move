Description | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Land (including buildings) | 5  
Shares (including an interest in a mining right)* | 5  
Interest in a mineral processing licence | 5  
Mining licence/right  | 10  
Mineral processing licence | 10

IP | 5  
**_*_** Personal income tax (PTT) on the indirect transfer by a non-resident company that indirectly holds at least 10% of the shareholding in a Zambian incorporated company will be levied at 5%. The tax will be levied on the greater of the:
  * Proportion that the value of the company incorporated in Zambia bears to the value of the company whose shares are being transferred multiplied by the value of the transferred shares.


  * Proportion that the value of the company incorporated in Zambia bears to the value of the company whose shares are being transferred multiplied by the consideration for the transferred shares.


  * Proportion that the value of the company incorporated in Zambia bears to the value of the company whose shares are being transferred multiplied by the nominal value of the transferred shares. This includes an interest in a mining right or an interest in a mineral processing licence.


The PTT liability is generally payable by the vendor. However, where the vendor/transferor is not available, a person, other than the transferor of the property, shall file a provisional tax return on behalf of the transferor where that person has been allowed to do so by a court order or has been appointed as a proxy for the registrar of court who has been authorised to render the provisional return. This will only apply under the following conditions:
  * The transferor is deceased.
  * The transferor is absent from Zambia. 
  * The transferor cannot be located despite all reasonable effort to do so.

Turnover tax applies to certain businesses where the turnover is more than ZMW 12,000 but not more than ZMW 800,000 _per annum_. A flat rate of 4% on business turnover will be applied where turnover is between ZMW 12,000 and ZMW 800,000 _per annum_.
