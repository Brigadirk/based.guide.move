## Foreign tax relief
Estonian-resident taxpayers who have received foreign-source taxable income are allowed to credit foreign income tax against their Estonian income tax liability if certain conditions are met. The tax credit is generally limited to 20% of foreign taxable income and is computed separately for each foreign country.
Resident taxpayers who receive from abroad more than 75% of their taxable income qualifying for the exemption method may apply deductions only in proportion to their taxable income received from Estonia. The restriction does not apply if the taxpayer voluntarily opts for the credit method to apply in respect of the foreign-sourced income.
## Tax treaties
_See the section in the Corporate summary for a list of countries with which Estonia has a DTT_.
## Totalisation agreements (social security agreements)
European Commission (EC) regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009 apply to EU member states, EEA countries, and Switzerland.
Estonia has effective social security agreements with Canada and Ukraine.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
The minimum monthly tax allowance is raised to 654 euros (EUR) starting from 2023, but it is set to decrease as the gross income increases. Consequently, personal tax allowances will become progressive in nature, and, as a result, the net income of low- and medium-income earners will increase.
From 1 January 2025, the personal income tax (PIT) rate will rise to 22%.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
An individual who is a resident of Estonia is liable to tax on worldwide income, irrespective of the origin of the income. Non-residents are taxed on their Estonian-source income.
Taxable income includes both active income, such as employment and business income, as well as passive income, such as capital gains, rents and royalties, interest, dividends, certain insurance proceeds, pensions, scholarships, grants, prizes and lottery winnings, etc. This list is not exhaustive; consequently, any income derived by a resident individual not falling within the above categories is taxable, unless a tax exemption is available.
Most items of personal income are taxed on a gross basis, mainly through withholding at source, whereas business income and capital gains are taxed on a net basis subject to certain conditions.
There are no special taxation rules for expatriates.
## Personal income tax rates
Estonia has a proportional (i.e. flat) tax rate of 20%, which applies to all items of income derived by a resident taxpayer. From 2018 onwards, dividends that have been subject to the reduced rate of 14% at the level of the distributing Estonian company will have withholding tax (WHT) of 7% levied. Certain pension payments are subject to 10% income tax.
## Local income taxes
There are no local taxes on income.

## Taxable period
The period of taxation is a calendar year.
## Tax returns
In general, resident individuals must file an individual tax return by 30 April following the year in which the income arises. Electronic filing of tax returns becomes available from 15 February. Certain items of foreign-source tax-exempt income must be reported for information purposes.
Married resident taxpayers may elect between filing their tax returns jointly or separately.
For non-residents, the tax withheld at source at domestic or treaty rates generally constitutes final tax as regards their Estonian-source income, and the non-resident is generally not obligated to submit a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities for income so taxed. However, for certain types of Estonian-source income, non-residents are liable under Estonian domestic law to self-assess Estonian tax and submit a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities by the following deadlines:
  * Capital gains realised from certain types of assets should generally be reported by 30 April of the year following realisation of the gain. 
  * Capital gain from the sale or disposal of immovable property located in Estonia should be reported within one month from realising the gain. 
  * Profits derived from business conducted in Estonia should generally be reported by 30 June of the following year (or within two months if business activities in Estonia are terminated). 
  * Other items of Estonian-source income from which income tax was not withheld but should have been withheld should be reported by 30 April of the year following the year in which the income was received. 


## Payment of tax
A resident individual will receive an income tax assessment based on one’s return as filed at least 30 days before the tax payment is due and, based on that, must pay the final amount of income tax due by 1 October of the year following the period of taxation. The resident taxpayer who reported business income, foreign income, or capital gains in the tax return must pay the final amount of income tax due by 1 October of the year following the period of taxation.
Non-residents will not receive tax assessments. In general, non-residents must pay the income tax due to the tax authorities within three months from the deadline of submitting the tax return.
Late payment interest on tax arrears is 0.06% per day.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Personal allowances and deductions
Starting from 1 January 2023, the system of personal allowances underwent a significant reform. Mainly, the minimum monthly basic personal allowance was increased to EUR 654, but it is set to decrease for income over certain levels, which results in a specific progressive personal allowance system.
Resident individuals are allowed to make certain deductions from their annual gross income. These include the basic personal allowance of EUR 7,848 (i.e. EUR 654 per month), which, from 2023, only applies to the full extent if annual income is up to EUR 14,400. For annual income over EUR 14,400, the yearly allowance is calculated under the following formula: 7,848 - 7,848 / 10,800 x (sum of income - 14,400). For annual income exceeding EUR 25,200, the basic allowance will be zero.
In addition, deductions are allowed for certain personal allowances, as well as certain deductible documented expenses, which fall into two categories.
The first category includes certain mandatory payments, which can be deducted without any limitations, including unemployment insurance contributions, contributions to compulsory accumulative pension scheme, and certain obligatory contributions to foreign social security schemes.
The second category includes deductions that are allowed for tax policy reasons and which have various limitations on deductibility. The second category includes certain educational expenses, certain gifts and donations, and certain payments to personal pension schemes.
As of 2016, a 20% deduction is available for income from renting out immovable property. 20% is an estimate of incurred expenses related to the property; these expenses do not have to be documented.
A non-resident individual of another European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA) member state can make various deductions from one's income proportionally to the Estonian-source income share of their entire taxable income for the period of taxation.
## Business deductions
Business deductions can only be made from business income by individuals registered as sole proprietorships. For income tax purposes, sole proprietorships must follow cash basis accounting for their income and expenditure.
Sole proprietors have a right to open a special bank account where they can carry all their business income during the ten days after they have received it. The increase of the amount in that bank account is deducted from the taxable income of the sole proprietor and the decrease of the amount in the account is added to their taxable income.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
In general, individual taxpayers are taxed on a cash basis. Exceptionally, the Estonian controlled foreign company (CFC) (anti-deferral) rules attribute undistributed profits of foreign ’tax haven’ companies to resident individual taxpayers if such companies are controlled by Estonian residents.
## Employment income
Employment income is taxed on a gross basis and includes salaries, fees for personal services, and directors’ fees. In general, fringe benefits are only taxable at the employer level and are not included in the gross income of an employee.
For resident individuals, foreign-source employment income is exempt from Estonian income tax if the following two conditions are met:
  * The individual is present in a foreign country for employment purposes for more than 182 days during any 12-month period. 
  * The foreign-source employment income is taxable in the foreign country and this can be substantiated by written documentation, which has to indicate the amount of the related foreign income tax (even if this is zero). 


Non-resident individuals are liable to Estonian income tax on Estonian-source employment income. This is deemed to arise if the location of performing personal services is in Estonia and the remuneration is paid by an Estonian employer (including non-residents acting as employers in Estonia and PEs of non-residents if the remuneration is paid out or borne by it) or if the individual has been present in Estonia for employment purposes for more than 182 days during any 12-month period. Directors’ fees paid for the work done for Estonian companies are always taxable in Estonia regardless of the residence of the payer of the fees.
## Capital gains and investment income
Capital gains from the sale or exchange of assets are generally taxed on a net basis as part of ordinary income, but capital losses can only be offset against capital gains. Certain qualifying capital gains are exempt from income tax, such as the gain from the sale of a personal residence.
Certain capital gains realised by non-residents form part of their Estonian-source income, for which they are liable for self-assessing 20% Estonian income tax and submitting a tax return to the Estonian tax authorities. Such types of income include:
  * certain capital gains (e.g. gains linked with immovable property located in Estonia) 
  * profits derived from business conducted in Estonia without a registered PE, and 
  * other items of income from which tax should have been withheld but was not. 


Investment income is generally taxed on a gross basis as part of ordinary income. This may include, for example, certain foreign dividends, interest, and insurance proceeds. However, a tax-exempt investment account scheme is applicable for resident individuals, under which individuals can defer the moment of taxation of investment income and capital gains derived from qualified securities. Under certain conditions, individuals can reinvest such income or gains without paying any income tax.
In fear of an increase in payment of 'dividend salaries', the total corporate income tax (CIT) burden of a dividend is kept at approximately 20%. If a resident individual receives a dividend that has been taxed at 14%, then a 7% WHT rate applies. Foreign dividends are tax exempt provided that either the underlying profits out of which dividends are paid have been subject to foreign income tax or if income tax was withheld from dividends received.
If the recipient of a dividend that is taxed at 14% CIT is a non-resident individual, a 7% WHT rate will apply unless a tax treaty provides for a lower rate of WHT (5% or 0%).
## Rental and royalty income
Rents and royalties generated from the use of certain assets are generally taxed on a gross basis as part of ordinary income, unless the taxpayer elects for net basis taxation as part of business income.
For non-resident individuals, the gross amounts of rents and royalties are generally subject to WHT at source, at 20% and 10%, respectively.
## Exempt income
For resident individuals, there exist numerous items of tax-exempt income (i.e. excluded from gross income). _As described above_ , some of the more important items of tax-exempt income include qualifying foreign employment income, qualifying foreign dividends, and certain qualifying capital gains.

There are no other significant tax credits or incentives for individuals in Estonia.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
Individuals are considered residents of Estonia if they have a permanent residence in Estonia, their stay in Estonia during any 12-month period exceeds 183 days, or they are Estonian public servants who are sent abroad on assignment. An individual may be deemed to have become a tax resident from the date of one’s arrival to Estonia. For the purposes of determining the number of days, any part of a day counts as a full day.
If the tie-breaker article in an applicable double tax treaty (DTT) allocates the residence of a dual-resident individual to a foreign country (most often if the home and family of the individual remain abroad during an assignment to Estonia), then the individual will be taxed as a non-resident in Estonia regardless of the above-mentioned Estonian domestic rule.
The change of tax residence must be notified to the Tax and Customs Board.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
## Social security contributions
Employers operating in Estonia (including non-residents having a permanent establishment [PE] or employees in Estonia) must pay social tax on certain payments to individuals at the rate of 33% (whereof 20% is used for financing public pension insurance and 13% for financing public health insurance). Social tax paid by employers is not capped and mainly applies to salaries, directors’ fees, and service fees paid and fringe benefits granted to individuals. The period of taxation is a calendar month.
The net business income derived by individuals registered as sole proprietorships is also subject to 33% social tax (capped). Sole proprietorships are required to make quarterly advance payments of social tax in fixed amounts, which are credited against the final annual social tax liability.
## Unemployment insurance contributions
Employers are also required to pay and withhold unemployment insurance contributions. Employers must pay 0.8% and employees must pay 1.6% (collected by employers through payroll withholding). The contributions mainly apply to salaries and service fees paid to individuals.
## Compulsory accumulative pension scheme
Resident employees born after 31 December 1982 are obligated to join the compulsory accumulative pension scheme and make 2% contributions to the scheme (mostly collected by employers through payroll withholding). The contributions mainly apply to salaries, directors’ fees, and service fees. For resident employees born before 1983, joining the pension scheme is voluntary; however, after joining, it becomes compulsory and the employees may not subsequently leave the scheme. In addition to the 2% contribution made by the employee, 4% of the social security contribution payable by the employer (33%) will be transferred to the employee’s pension account.
Employees had an opportunity to increase the pension contributions from 2% to 3% (temporarily for the period 2014 to 2017) by submitting a respective application before 15 September 2013. Where the employee opted for the increased contributions, the contribution by the state was increased from 4% to 6% on account of the employee's personal pension account.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 22%. A reduced rate of 9% is applied to books, periodicals (with few exceptions), hotel accommodation services, and listed pharmaceuticals. A reduced rate of 5% is applied to certain periodicals both on physical medium and electronically.
The VAT rate on the export of goods and certain services is 0% (i.e. exempt with credit). Certain services, such as health care, education, insurance, certain financial, and transactions with securities, are exempt (i.e. exempt without credit).
_See the_ _section in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Land and property taxes
Land is subject to annual land tax that is calculated on the assessed value of land at rates between 0.1% and 1%, depending on municipality. The tax is paid by the owners of land, or sometimes by the users of land, generally in two instalments, by 1 April and 1 October. Land up to a certain size under a home is exempted from land tax.
There is no property tax (i.e. tax on the value of buildings).
Property transfers are generally subject to state and notary fees.
## Local taxes
Local taxes can be imposed by rural municipalities or city councils; however, the fiscal significance of local taxes is almost non-existent. Local taxes include advertisement tax, road and street closure tax, motor vehicle tax, tax on keeping animals, entertainment tax, and parking charges.
