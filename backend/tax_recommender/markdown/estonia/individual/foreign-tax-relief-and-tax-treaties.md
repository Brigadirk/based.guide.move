## Foreign tax relief
Estonian-resident taxpayers who have received foreign-source taxable income are allowed to credit foreign income tax against their Estonian income tax liability if certain conditions are met. The tax credit is generally limited to 20% of foreign taxable income and is computed separately for each foreign country.
Resident taxpayers who receive from abroad more than 75% of their taxable income qualifying for the exemption method may apply deductions only in proportion to their taxable income received from Estonia. The restriction does not apply if the taxpayer voluntarily opts for the credit method to apply in respect of the foreign-sourced income.
