The minimum monthly tax allowance is raised to 654 euros (EUR) starting from 2023, but it is set to decrease as the gross income increases. Consequently, personal tax allowances will become progressive in nature, and, as a result, the net income of low- and medium-income earners will increase.
From 1 January 2025, the personal income tax (PIT) rate will rise to 22%.
