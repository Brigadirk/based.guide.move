## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 19 July 2024
A legal entity is considered resident in Estonia for tax purposes if it is established under Estonian law. There is no management and control test for the purpose of determining corporate residency. Most tax treaty tie-breakers for legal entities are based on competent authority procedures.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
A PE (including a branch registered in the Commercial Register) of a foreign entity is deemed to be a taxpayer. Under the domestic law, which deviates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention, a PE is defined as an enterprise through which the permanent business activities of the non-resident are conducted in Estonia. A PE is deemed to be created as a result of the business activities conducted in Estonia that are geographically linked or have movable character or as a result of the business activities of an agent that is authorised to conclude contracts in the name of the non-resident.
