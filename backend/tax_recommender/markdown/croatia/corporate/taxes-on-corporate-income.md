## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 07 January 2025
CIT is generally paid at a rate of 18 %. For taxpayers with revenues in the tax period lower than EUR 1 million, the rate of 10 % is applied. The CIT payers are domestic enterprises engaged in independent activities on a long-term basis for the purpose of deriving profit, busines units (Pes) of foreign enterprises, and individuals (natural persons) performing a business activity who choose to pay CIT instead of PIT.
The CIT base is the accounting profit adjusted for deductions and disallowed items. Croatian residents pay CIT on profit derived in Croatia and abroad, and non-residents pay CIT only on profits derived in Croatia. The tax base also includes gains arising from liquidation, sale, change of legal form, and division of the taxpayer if it is determined at the market values.
Payments into voluntarily pension funds paid by an employer for an employee under certain conditions prescribed by the CIT Act are also considered as deductible expenditures.
Expenditures are not considered to be deductible expenditures if they are not related to the taxpayer's business activity.
