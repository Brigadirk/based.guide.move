Notes
  1. European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) member state tax resident can increase one's basic personal allowance on the basis of dependent family members. However, for this increase to be available, income included in the process of annual assessment of tax liability needs to:
     * Represent at least 90 % of the taxpayerâ€™s total (worldwide) income realised in the given tax period, and
     * Be exempt from taxation or tax-free in the country of tax residence that is different from Croatia.


Some of the outlined items can be used only via the process of annual tax liability assessment while others can be used for calculating income tax prepayments _as indicated in the_ _section_.
