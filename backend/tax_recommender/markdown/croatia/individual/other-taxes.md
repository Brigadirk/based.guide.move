## Social security contributions
The Croatian social security system covers pension and health insurance.
Social security contributions are payable in respect of realised income or in respect of an artificial basis, depending on the status the individual has in the social security system as well as other relevant circumstances.
In the case of dependently employed individuals, social security charges are borne by the employee and employer.
Employee's social security contributions are pension contributions levied at the rate of 20 % (15 % first pillar payments, 5 % second pillar payments). The base for their payment is as follows:
  * For total monthly gross salary of up to (and including) EUR 700.00: The base is calculated as the total monthly gross salary reduced for EUR 300.00.
  * For total monthly gross salary ranging between EUR 700.01 up to EUR 1,300.00: The base is calculated as the total monthly gross salary reduced for 0.5 x (EUR 1.300,00 - total monthly gross salary).
  * For total monthly gross salary exceeding EUR 1,300.00, the base is the total amount of gross salary, which is further capped at the following values for 2024:


  *     * EUR 9,360.00 monthly cap (applicable for both first and second pillar payments in case of salary).
    * EUR 112,320.00 annual cap (applicable for first pillar payments irrespective of whether the payment is salary or another type of remuneration).


Additionally, employers make social contributions for the following social security benefits:
  * Health insurance: 16.5 %


The basis for payment of employerâ€™s social security contributions is gross salary, which is not capped.
Employers have certain additional obligations with respect to disabled individuals.
Apart from some exceptions, employers employing 20 and more employees are required to employ a prescribed number of disabled individuals. The number amounts to 3 % of the total number of employees.
Employers that do not comply with prescribed requirements are required to pay a monthly fee amounting to 20 % of minimal gross salary (minimal gross salary for 2024 amounts to EUR 840.00) for each disabled individual that employer was required to employ.
