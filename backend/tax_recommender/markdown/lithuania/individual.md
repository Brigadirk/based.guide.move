## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Foreign tax relief
Residents are entitled to a relief from double taxation under effective double taxation treaties (DTTs).
According to the domestic legislation, income received by a resident of Lithuania in a foreign country that is an EU member state or with which Lithuania has a valid DTT is tax exempted in Lithuania only if the documentary evidence concerning the income received in that foreign country and the amount of income tax or equivalent tax paid on such income is submitted to the tax authorities.
This rule does not apply for interest, dividends and royalties received. In these cases, tax credit can be taken in Lithuania for PIT (or its equivalent) paid abroad. However, tax credit may not exceed Lithuanian PIT attributable to the income taxed abroad. Also, it cannot be higher than foreseen by the DTT between the two countries (even though the national law may allow taxation at higher rates).
Residents can also deduct the tax actually paid on income sourced in third countries (up to the PIT rate applicable to such income in Lithuania), provided that supporting documentation from a foreign tax administrator is provided to the Lithuanian tax authorities.
## Tax treaties
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Lithuania has a DTT_.

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Starting from 1 January 2025, the higher 32% personal income tax (PIT) rate for the income exceeding the threshold of 126,532 euros (EUR) should be applied. 
Employment income exceeding the EUR 126,532 threshold is subject to a lower rate of social security contributions at 6.98%. Employer‘s social security contributions of 1.77% (standard rate) are not capped.
The legislation was amended where the possibility to refund social security contributions paid during the calendar year at a standard rate was foreseen for the employees having more than one employer and exceeding the aforementioned annual income threshold in total. In previous years, social security contributions ceilings were applied to each employer separately, and the refund was not possible even if the annual threshold was reached by adding the individual's income from all employers.
Taxation of other personal income was slightly reduced, and the progressive PIT rate at 20% is applied to annual income exceeding EUR 253,065.
### Investment account
Since January 1, 2025, Lithuania has implemented a new investment account (IA) scheme, creating more favourable conditions for individual investors. IA gives the opportunity to defer income tax payments until the funds in the account are used for non-investment purposes. 
Key points of the IA scheme:
  * The IA tax regime applies only to accounts opened in EEA, OECD member states or countries with which Lithuania has and applies Double Tax Treaties.
  * Only individual account (not joint) can be used as IA.
  * The IA has to be reported to the Lithuanian Tax Authority by the owner.
  * The amount of the contribution paid in the IA is not limited. The number of accounts is not limited as well.
  * IA regime allows to invest in listed financial products (e.g. shares, bonds) named in art.121 of the Law on PIT. IA cannot be used for direct investments into startups and crypto currency.
  * The main principle of IA operation is that only the final investment result is taxed – funds withdrawn from the account (earned profits) which are not being reinvested further.
  * IA allows to deduct losses from one year from the profits of other years, taxing only the actual final result.
  * Only Lithuanian tax residents are allowed use the IA scheme.
  * IA is not mandatory and individuals who do not want to use IA, their investments (e.g. capital gains) should be taxed under regime named in section "Income determination" section "Capital gains".
  * The tax relief of EUR 500 is not applicable in the IA. 
  * PIT of 15% applies to profits up to EUR 253,065 and 20% applies on the excess.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
Worldwide income received by a Lithuanian tax resident is subject to PIT. However, only the following income sourced in Lithuania by a non-resident is subject to PIT:
  * Employment-related income or income arising from substantially similar relations.
  * Income from distributed profits and payments to the members of the Board or Supervisory Board.
  * Interest income, except for interest received on government non-equity securities.
  * Royalties.
  * Income from sports activities, including income directly or indirectly related to those activities irrespective of whether the payment is made directly to the sportsman concerned or a third party acting on behalf of and for that sportsman.
  * Income from performing activities, including income directly or indirectly related to those activities irrespective of whether the payment is made directly to the performing artist concerned or a third party acting on behalf of and for that performing artist.
  * Income from the lease of immovable property located in Lithuania.
  * Income from the sale or transfer of movable property if that object is subject to legal registration in accordance with the local regulations and such object is (or must be) registered in Lithuania, as well as income from the sale of immovable property located in Lithuania.
  * Income derived from individual activities carried out through a fixed base, as well as income earned abroad that is attributed to that fixed base in Lithuania, where the said income is related to the activities of a non-resident through the fixed base in Lithuania.
  * Compensation for copyright infringement.


## Personal income tax rates
PIT at a 20% rate is applied to income amounts not exceeding EUR 126,532 per calendar year in 2025 and at a 32% rate for the exceeding part for:
  * employment-related income
  * payments to the members of the Board or Supervisory Board
  * income derived under copyright agreements (when it is received from the company that is also the employer of individual), and
  * income under civil agreement received by a manager of small partnership who is not a member of such small partnership.


Income from profit distribution (e.g. dividends) is taxable at a flat PIT rate of 15%.
Individual activity income is taxed depending on the amount of income received. PIT calculated at the 15% flat rate on taxable income is reduced by applying a PIT credit, calculated according to special formulas (effective rate may vary from 5% to 15%). _Please see Business income in the section for more information_.
Other income not specified above is taxed at a PIT rate of 15% if income amounts do not exceed EUR 253,065 per calendar year. A 20% PIT rate is applicable to income exceeding this threshold.
## Local, state, or provincial PIT rates
There are no local, state, or provincial PIT rates applicable in Lithuania.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Taxable period
The tax year in Lithuania is a calendar year.
## Tax returns
Under the tax payment procedure, an individual’s income (including income that is non-taxable) is divided into two classes, Class A (where the tax is calculated and withheld by the person making the payment, e.g. the employer) and Class B (where tax is paid personally by an individual filing a personal tax return).
Class A income includes the following income received from a Lithuanian entity, a foreign entity through its permanent establishment (PE), or a non-resident of Lithuania through one’s permanent base:
  * Employment-related income.
  * Income from sports and performing activities.
  * Proceeds from the sale or other transfer with title of movable property if that property is subject to legal registration in Lithuania and is (or must be) registered in Lithuania or immovable property located in Lithuania, when such income is received by a non-resident of Lithuania.
  * Interest income received by a Lithuanian tax non-resident.


Class A income also includes the following income received from a resident of Lithuania:
  * Employment-related income.
  * Income from sports and performing activities.
  * Immovable property rental income received from a Lithuanian tax resident performing individual activities (except for income received under business certificate).
  * Interest income.
  * Royalties.


Class B income includes the following income:
  * Gambling and lottery winnings.
  * Income from individual activities (with certain exceptions).
  * Income from the sale or other transfer of financial instruments.
  * All other income not attributable to Class A.


Monthly returns of income tax withheld from Class A income (including Class B income, on which PIT was incorrectly withheld/paid) must be filed by employers on or before the 15th day of the next month. The summarised annual report on income tax withheld from Class A income must be submitted on or before the 15th day of the second month of the following tax period (i.e. 15 February).
A Lithuanian entity, a foreign entity through its PE, or a non-resident of Lithuania through their permanent base that has paid out Class B income must submit the annual statement on Class B income paid out on or before 15 February of the next calendar year.
At the close of the tax period, a resident of Lithuania who, during the tax period, derived income that, subject to the tax payment procedure, is attributable to both Class A and Class B income is obligated to submit an annual income tax return to the tax administrator on or before 1 May of the following year and declare therein total income derived during the previous tax period and the amount of income tax computed thereon.
Individuals who do not wish to take advantage of the allowable deductions or who received only Class A income (when income tax is correctly withheld and paid to the state budget by the companies paying this income to the individuals) and whose tax exempt amount does not have to be recalculated, as well as if the higher PIT rate should not apply, may choose not to file an annual income return.
When an individual becomes a Lithuanian tax resident due to more than 280 days spent in Lithuania in two successive tax periods, the tax return and tax payment for the first period are due by 31 December of the second year.
Lithuanian tax non-residents are obligated to file tax returns on a monthly basis and pay PIT within 25 days from the receipt of income derived under employment contracts from foreign entities not having theirPEsin Lithuania and non-residents of Lithuania not having their fixed bases. Individuals have an obligation to file the annual non-resident’s tax return if the higher PIT rate should be applied to the Lithuanian-source income amounts exceeding the established thresholds. Such annual tax return submission deadline is1 May of the following year.
## Payment of tax
Income tax withheld by employers must be paid to the state budget on or before the 15th day of the respective month (if a portion of income has been paid out on or before the 15th day of that month) or on or before the last day of the respective month (if the last portion of income has been paid on or before the last day of that month).
Lithuanian tax residents filing their annual income tax returns have to pay the related PIT on or before 1 May.
Lithuanian tax non-residents who file tax returns on a monthly basis have to pay PIT within 25 days from the receipt of income that is reported. In case an individual should pay the additional PIT amount due to the fact that income amounts exceed the established thresholds, PIT should be paid by 1 May of the following year.
## Tax audit process
Generally, the Lithuanian tax system for individuals is based on self-assessment; however, the tax authorities can undertake special activities to ensure that individual taxpayers meet their tax obligations. Such activities can be of various forms, including general reviews of submitted individual tax returns, sending reminders for income reporting/tax payment due to income related information received from third parties (e.g. companies that made payments to individual taxpayers, foreign tax administrators), questionnaires for specific areas (e.g. for self-employed individuals), initiating the reviews of specific issues, and tax audits.
## Statute of limitations
The statute of limitations in Lithuania is the current and five previous tax periods for PIT (except for individuals performing registered individual activities, to whom a three-year open period applies) and the current and three previous tax years for social security contributions. However, the statute of limitations may be extended if a criminal case has been initiated against the taxpayer and it requires determining the damage caused to the state. 
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of focus for the tax authorities include:
  * Income re-classification issues in order to reach more favourable taxation (e.g. employment income is replaced by income from individual activities, employers pay a part of salary in different forms of remuneration [e.g. car rental income]).
  * Non-taxable employers' benefits to employees (e.g. employee events, contributions to life insurance companies).
  * Unreported foreign income. 
  * Tax avoidance cases in general.


Moreover, the PE investigation is a 'hot topic' of the Lithuanian tax authorities, which may result in individual taxation-related issues.

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Employment expenses
Employment-related expenses are not deductible from individual employment compensation.
## Personal deductions
The following expenses incurred by Lithuanian tax residents over the tax period may be deducted from taxable income:
  * An individual will be able to deduct the expenses incurred for one's own or spouse’s benefit for building finish and any type of its repair (except for apartment building renovation), car repair, and childcare services for children until 18 years, provided that the service provider is/should be registered as a Lithuanian taxpayer. The total annual amount of such expenses should not exceed EUR 2,000. The relief is temporary and is applied to 2019, 2020, and 2021 calendar years.
  * Pension contributions paid by the tax resident as additional accumulative pension contributions (as per the provisions of the Law on Pension Accumulation, i.e. second tier pension fund contributions paid in excess of the maximum established rate) to pension funds, associations of professional pension funds’ participants, or similar established in the EEA member states or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries will be deductible, provided that such contributions exceed 3% of the individual’s income on which social security contributions are calculated.
  * Pension contributions paid to pension funds established in EEA member states or OECD member countries for one’s own benefit or for the benefit of a spouse, minor children, or disabled children. Applicable for contracts concluded till 31 December 2024.
  * Life insurance premiums paid for one’s own benefit or for the benefit of a spouse, minor children, or disabled children if the life insurance company is registered in an EEA member state or OECD member country. Applicable for contracts concluded till 31 December 2024.
  * Payments for vocational training under a formal vocational training program or formal vocational training program module after the completion of which the relevant qualification or competencies are obtained, as well as the payments for studies after the completion of which the higher education qualification is obtained (the loan amount repaid over the tax period may be tax deductible).


The total amount of deductible expenses specified above is limited to 25% of the taxable income (subject to 15%, 20%, and 32% PIT rates) during the calendar year. The total deductible life insurance premiums and both types of pension contributions amount should not exceed EUR 1,500.
## Standard deductions
A monthly tax-exempt amount (TEA) is applied only to employment-related income of Lithuanian tax residents, as follows:
  * A TEA of EUR 747 per month is applied to individuals whose employment-related income does not exceed an amount of one minimum monthly salary that was in force as of 1 January of the current tax year (EUR 1,038 in 2025).
  * If employment-related income exceeds an amount of one minimum monthly salary that was in force as of 1 January of the current tax year, a monthly TEA is calculated according to the following formulae: 
    * When an individuals‘ employment _-_ related income per month does not exceed an amount of EUR 2,387.29, monthly TEA = 747 - 0.49 x (the individual’s employment-related income per month minus one minimum monthly salary that was in force as of 1 January of the current tax year, i.e. EUR 1,038 in 2025).
    * When an individuals‘ employment _-_ related income per month exceeds an amount of EUR 2,387.29, monthly TEA = 400 - 0.18 x (the individual’s employment related income per month minus EUR 642).


  * The TEA is proportionally reduced for larger amounts of income, and, if income amounts to or exceeds EUR 2,864.22 per month, no TEA is applied.


The annual TEA shall be applied to the total annual income received by the individual. In cases where an individual receives additional income to the salary income (or salary increases during the year), corrections are made at the end of the year (when filing the annual income tax return). The calculation is made taking into consideration the annual taxable income, including tax exempt income received for the work performed in the country Lithuania has a double taxation treaty (DTT) concluded with and accordingly taxed in such a country. Also, income from individual activities derived under business certificates is not included in the calculation of the annual TEA.
The annual TEA can be applied to Lithuanian tax non-residents only at the end of the tax period by submitting the annual PIT return, provided their annual gross income does not exceed EUR 34,370.67.
For all children, the Lithuanian local municipal offices pay to families EUR 122.50 per month per child from birth to 18 years of age or older if they study according to a general curriculum until they reach the age of 21. The additional children allowances are also possible for families receiving certain low amounts of income, having three or more children, etc.
## Personal allowances
There are no personal allowances available in Lithuania.
## Business expenses
Expenses incurred for the purpose of receiving income from individual activities by self-employed individuals are tax deductible. There are two options to deduct expenses from income received/earned during the tax year:
  * It is possible to deduct the actual expenses incurred by individuals while performing individual activities; however, such expenses have to be supported by relevant substantiating documents.
  * Alternatively, it is possible to deduct 30% of income received/earned, and no supporting documents are required.


## Losses
In certain cases, individuals performing individual activities can carry forward the losses for an unlimited period of time, until the activity that resulted in such losses is terminated.
Generally, losses resulting from the sales of shares and other financial instruments can reduce the profits earned from such sales during the same tax year (certain restrictions apply). However, losses resulting from other sales of property (e.g. immovable property) do not reduce the taxable base of other sales transactions of such property. Moreover, it is not possible to carry forward losses resulting from capital gains.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Employment income
Taxable monthly earnings in cash and in kind received from the principal workplace include wages, various additional payments (e.g. sickness and maternity benefits paid from social insurance), bonuses, employee stock option benefits, incentive payments, taxable allowances and other similar payments, compensation upon discharge from work (e.g. compensation for remaining vacation), gratuities, and compensation for unlawful dismissal from work.
The following income derived from employment in a Lithuanian legal entity is non-taxable for PIT purposes:
  * Life insurance contributions, additional (voluntary) health insurance contributions, and pension contributions paid by an employer on behalf of an employee are not considered as taxable benefits if certain conditions are met and provided that the total amount of such contributions does not exceed 25% of the employee's annual employment-related income and the recipient of such contributions is established in an EEA country.
  * Certain compensations established by the local Lithuanian legislation (e.g. business trip related expense reimbursements, daily allowances if certain conditions are met).
  * Income received as a prize or gift from the employer if the value does not exceed EUR 200 per tax year.
  * The benefit when employer pays for railway or public transport tickets for the employee for the arrival/departure to/from one's workplace.
  * Payments made by an employer upon the death of a spouse or certain other heirs of an employee, as well as benefits paid to a spouse, children (adopted children), and parents (adoptive parents) upon the death of an employee.
  * Other income determined in Article 17 of the Law on PIT.


### Equity compensation
For tax purposes, equity compensation received by an employee in kind or in cash is treated as employment-related income and is subject to PIT. The taxable amount is calculated based on the difference between fair market value of the equity granted and the amount paid for it by the employee, if any.
Employee stock options exercised at no cost or for lower than their fair market value price not earlier than three years following their grant date will be treated as non-taxable income for PIT purposes, meaning that taxation should arise only at the time of share sale. This relief applies to stock options granted after 1 February 2020.
## Business income
An individual's business income derived from self-employment and other individual activities, including income received from rent, sale, or transfer of property related to individual activities (not taking into account objects of immovable kind) is taxed depending on the amount of income received. PIT calculated at the 15% flat rate on taxable income is reduced by applying a PIT credit, calculated according to special formulas. Therefore:
  * A 5% rate applies if taxable income does not exceed EUR 20,000 per calendar year.
  * A proportionally increasing rate ranging from 5% to 15% applies to taxable income exceeding EUR 20,000 but lower than EUR 35,000 received per calendar year.
  * A 15% flat PIT rate is applied to the taxable income amount of EUR 35,000 and higher received per calendar year.


Income under a business certificate (including certain rental income) can be received if it does not exceed the limit of EUR 45,000; the excess is taxed at a PIT rate of 15% by applying a PIT credit as commented above.
## Capital gains
Taxable income derived from the sale of property is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price, and the taxable gain is subject to a 15% PIT rate for income amount not exceeding EUR 253,065 per calendar year for 2025. The exceeding part is taxable at a PIT rate of 20%.
The following capital gains are non-taxable:
  * Profits from transfer of financial instruments or realisation of derivatives not exceeding EUR 500 per tax year (with certain exceptions).
  * Income from the sale of housing (including land) located in an EEA member state if the individual’s place of residence was declared there during the last two years prior to the sale. If the place of residence was declared for a shorter period but income received from the sale was invested into the acquisition of another housing located in one of the EEA member states in one year after the sale and the place of residence was declared there accordingly, such income would also be treated as non-taxable.
  * Income from the sale or other transfer of movable property that is legally registered in Lithuania or within an EEA member state if the property was acquired more than three years prior to its sale or other transfer.
  * Income from the sale of immovable property (except for housing  _as indicated above_) if the property was acquired more than ten years prior to its sale.
  * Capital gains (not mentioned above) not exceeding EUR 2,500 during the tax period.


## Dividend income
Dividends are subject to a flat 15% PIT rate.
## Interest income
The following interest income is tax exempt:
  * Interest income received on consumer credits granted via peer-to-peer lending platforms or funds lent via crowdfunding platforms in Lithuania or in another EEA country is non-taxable, provided that the amount does not exceed EUR 500 per calendar year.
  * Interest received on (i) government or municipal bonds of the member states of the EEA and (ii) deposits kept in banks and other credit institutions of the EEA member states if the government or municipal bonds are acquired or the contracts of deposits are concluded before 31 December 2013.
  * Interest received on non-equity securities if such securities (i.e. corporate bonds) are acquired before 31 December 2013 and started to be redeemed not earlier than 366 days after the date of issue.
  * When the contracts of (i) deposits kept in banks and other credit institutions (not necessarily in the EEA member states) are concluded or (ii) non-equity securities or (iii) non-equity government securities (i.e. government or municipal bonds, not necessarily of the EEA member states) are acquired after 1 January 2014, the tax relief is applied only to the amount of such interest that does not exceed EUR 500 per tax year.


## Rental income
Income derived from rent is subject to a 15% PIT rate for the income amount not exceeding EUR 253,065 per calendar year for 2025. The exceeding part is taxable at a rate of 20%.
## Exempt income
Certain items of income are non-taxable in Lithuania, including:
  * Employee stock options exercised at no cost or for lower than their fair market value price not earlier than three years following their grant date are treated as non-taxable income for PIT purposes. This relief applies to stock options granted after 1 February 2020.
  * Various welfare allowances (except sickness, maternity/paternity) and compensations.
  * Inherited income, if it is subject to inheritance tax.
  * Income received as a gift from spouses, children (adopted children), parents (adoptive parents), brothers, sisters, grandchildren, and grandparents, as well as the amount (value) of income received as a gift from other individuals during the tax period, which shall not exceed the amount of EUR 2,500.
  * Lottery winnings, provided they are paid by EEA entities that pay taxes on the lottery turnover in accordance with the order established by the legislation of the EEA member states.
  * Awards, sport contest prizes, and lottery winnings herein the value of which does not exceed EUR 200, provided such prizes are received from the same person not more than six times during the tax period.
  * Sailors' earnings for their work on a ship registered in the Register of the EEA country maritime transport during the voyage.
  * Other income determined in Article 17 of the Law on PIT.

## Individual - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
## Social security contributions
The following income is subject to social security and health insurance contributions (only the main types of income are commented):
  * Income derived under employment agreements: Social security contributions at 1.45% to 2.71% (for time limited employment agreements at 2.17% to 3.43%) are applied to employers (no threshold applies), and social security contributions at 19.5% (including health insurance contributions at 6.98%) are withheld from employees income of EUR 114,162 per calendar year. A 6.98% rate applies above this threshold, withheld from the employee. Employers (with certain exceptions) also pay an additional contribution to the Guarantee Fund amounting to 0.16% and to the Long-term Employment Fund amounting to 0.16% on employee remuneration.
  * Income from distributed profits and other remuneration received by the members of the Board or Supervisory Board: Individuals are subject to social security contributions at 15.7% up to income of EUR 114,162 and 6.98% (health insurance contribution) above this threshold.
  * Income received from individual activities, except for income derived under business certificates: Social security contributions at 19.5% (including health insurance contributions at 6.98%) are applied to individuals. Social security and health insurance taxes are paid from 90% individual activity income overall (not profit).
  * Income received from individual activities derived under business certificates: Social security contributions at 15.7% (including 6.98% of health insurance contribution) are paid by individual per month on the amount of official minimum monthly salary amount in force. 
  * Income derived from sports activities, performers’ activities, and under copyright agreements (when it is received from the company that is also the employer of such individual): Income is subject to the same rates and thresholds for the company and individual as stated above for employment agreements (the additional contributions to the Guarantee Fund and Long-term Employment Fund are not applicable).
  * Income derived from sports activities, performers’ activities, and under copyright agreements (when it is received from the company that is not the employer of such individual): Social security contributions at 19.5% (including health insurance contributions at 6.98%) are applied to individuals. The social security contributions base is limited to 50% of taxable income. The aforementioned income subject to social security contributions derived from one company cannot exceed EUR 81,816.10 per year.


Individuals are also able to choose to additionally contribute for pension to the second-tier pension fund. Not contributing individuals under 40 years old as at 1 January of the respective year who are included in the register of insured individuals on 2 January of the same year are automatically involved in the participation in such pension accumulation system (such involvement will be performed every three years); however, they are allowed to choose whether to participate or not. Individuals over 40 years old are able to choose such a participation voluntarily.
Individuals who did not historically participate in this pension accumulation system are able to start contributing 3% in 2024. The state respectively adds the contribution of 1.5% on the state average remuneration amount. 
There is also an option to pay higher contributions (above 3%) either by individuals themselves or their employers. Such expenses are PIT deductible for individuals and corporate income tax (CIT) deductible for employers. 
Social security returns should be submitted by employers on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month, and the contributions should be paid on a monthly basis by the 15th day of the following month. The social security returns must be submitted electronically.
### International social security
The Lithuanian legislation on social security has been harmonised with the European Union (EU) regulations. Foreign employees seconded to Lithuania from a European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland and their employers are not required to pay social security contributions in Lithuania if an A1 certificate is obtained.
The reciprocal social security agreements exist between Lithuania and the following countries: Belarus, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States (US). The agreements with Belarus, Canada, Moldova, and Ukraine regulate the payment of social security contributions. Consequently, foreign employees seconded from the aforementioned countries to Lithuania who obtain relevant certificates on social security coverage in their home countries are also not required to pay social security contributions in Lithuania.
Employees temporarily seconded to Lithuania from third countries, with which Lithuania has no reciprocal social security agreements, are not required to pay the Lithuanian social security contributions as well, unless their permanent place of employment becomes Lithuania or the secondment exceeds one year.
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
The standard VAT rate is 21%.
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information._
## Net wealth/worth taxes
There are no net wealth/worth taxes in Lithuania.
## Inheritance tax
Property for inheritance tax purposes is defined as real estate and movable property as well as securities and cash. Foreigners pay this tax in the same manner as citizens of Lithuania, however, only inherited real estate and movable property subject to registration in Lithuania is subject to taxation.
Inheritance tax is not imposed if:
  * Property is inherited by the remaining spouse following the death of one's spouse.
  * Property is inherited by a child (adopted child), a parent (foster parent), a custodian, a child in custody, a grandparent, a grandchild, a brother, or a sister.
  * The taxable value of inherited property does not exceed EUR 3,000.


Otherwise, the tax rates for inherited property are 5% (if the taxable value is up to EUR 150,000) and 10% (if the taxable value exceeds EUR 150,000).
