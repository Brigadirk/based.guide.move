## Personal income tax rates
PIT at a 20% rate is applied to income amounts not exceeding EUR 126,532 per calendar year in 2025 and at a 32% rate for the exceeding part for:
  * employment-related income
  * payments to the members of the Board or Supervisory Board
  * income derived under copyright agreements (when it is received from the company that is also the employer of individual), and
  * income under civil agreement received by a manager of small partnership who is not a member of such small partnership.


Income from profit distribution (e.g. dividends) is taxable at a flat PIT rate of 15%.
Individual activity income is taxed depending on the amount of income received. PIT calculated at the 15% flat rate on taxable income is reduced by applying a PIT credit, calculated according to special formulas (effective rate may vary from 5% to 15%). _Please see Business income in the section for more information_.
Other income not specified above is taxed at a PIT rate of 15% if income amounts do not exceed EUR 253,065 per calendar year. A 20% PIT rate is applicable to income exceeding this threshold.
## Local, state, or provincial PIT rates
There are no local, state, or provincial PIT rates applicable in Lithuania.
