## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) agreement with the United States (US)
Lithuania signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States under the framework of FATCA. Lithuania and the United States will exchange information about the accounts of foreign (US or Lithuania, respectively) residents held in local financial institutions or local branches of foreign financial institutions.
## Implementation of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) provisions
The OECD has announced a package of BEPS recommendations aiming to increase transparency of international taxation and prevent tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. Many OECD countries, including Lithuania, have already started shifting certain provisions related to implementation of the BEPS recommendation package into their tax legislation (_see below_).
### Hybrid mismatch arrangements
Hybrid mismatch rules aim to prevent obtaining a double non-taxation benefit by exploiting differences between the tax treatment of entities and instruments across different countries. Lithuanian rules state that when the payment is deductible in two countries, or deductible in one country and non-taxable in another, tax discrepancies are neutralised by treating such payment as non-deductible expense or taxable income in Lithuania.
From 1 January 2023, the new amendments to the Law on CIT relating to anti-hybrid rules have come into force (_please see_ _Amendments to the tax laws in the section_).
