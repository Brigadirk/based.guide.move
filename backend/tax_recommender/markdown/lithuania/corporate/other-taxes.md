## Customs duties
EU customs law is applicable in full.
EU customs law, also known as the Union Customs Code, compiles the rules, arrangements, and procedures applicable to goods traded between the European Union and non-member countries. The Union Customs Code indicates an obligation on a person to pay the amount of the import or export duties that apply to specific goods under the EU provisions in force. The application of the EU customs law means that:
  * trade between Lithuania and other EU countries is customs-free
  * imports from non-EU countries are subject to EU customs tariffs, and
  * numerous free trade agreements concluded between EU and non-EU countries apply to Lithuania.


## Excise taxes
Excise duty is imposed on the following goods produced in or imported (brought to from other EU countries) into Lithuania: ethyl alcohol and alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine; processed tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and smoking tobacco; raw tobacco; heating tobacco products; electronic cigarettes liquid; energy-related products, including petrol, gasoline, certain oils and their substitutes or additives; coal, coke, lignite and peat intended for heating; natural gas; electricity.

## Payroll taxes
Employers should withhold PIT at the rate of 20% from the employee’s salary. In case employment related income exceeds a certain threshold (EUR 114,162 for 2024) per calendar year, the employee is required to pay the higher 32% PIT rate on the part exceeding such threshold while filing the annual PIT return (i.e. to additionally transfer 12% on such income part after the calendar year ends). 
There are no additional payroll taxes applicable to an employer other than the employee’s and employer's SSC and the employer’s contributions to the Guarantee Fund and to the Long-term Employment Fund (_see below_).
## Social security contributions (SSC)
SSC is composed of employee’s and employer’s parts (both payments are administered by employer). Rates are higher for annual income up to a certain threshold (EUR 114,162 for 2024).
Employee’s income up to this threshold is subject to the standard rate of SSC for employers in the range from 1.45% to 2.17% and from 12.52% to 19.5% (from 15.52% to 22.5% with pension accruals) for employees. Income above this threshold is subject to lower employee’s SSC of 6.98%, and the employer's SSC part is not capped.
Also, SSC (employee’s and employer’s parts) must be paid by the employer on the official minimum monthly salary amount in force regardless of the fact that an employee receives lower salary (not applicable when an individual is employed in another company, receives an old age pension benefit, is not older than 24 years, has limited capacity to work, or receives maternity/paternity or childcare benefit, etc.).
## Contributions to the Guarantee Fund and Long-term Employment Fund
