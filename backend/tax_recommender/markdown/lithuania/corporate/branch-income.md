Last reviewed - 08 August 2024
A branch of a foreign company is defined as a structural subunit of a foreign company that has an establishment in Lithuania and is entitled to engage in commercial activities in Lithuania as well as conclude contracts and undertake obligations according to the power of attorney issued to the branch by its founder. A branch does not have the status of a legal person. It is taxed in the same manner as a PE (_see the section_).
