## Royalty income
Royalty income is treated as income for corporate income tax purposes. Any royalty income received by a standard-tax paying company is taxable at 0%.
## Foreign income
Resident corporations are liable to tax on their worldwide income. Income tax is levied on foreign branch income when earned, and on investment income from foreign dividends, interest, rents, and royalties. Double taxation is mitigated either through unilateral relief (by giving credit for foreign taxation of up to three-quarters of the effective Guernsey rate) or by treaty relief.
