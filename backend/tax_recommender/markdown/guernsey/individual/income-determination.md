This will include certain benefits. Where a non-resident carries out any duties in Guernsey, the emoluments attaching to these duties are assessable in Guernsey.
Directors with substantial control of a limited liability company (LLC) will now be treated as employees, with social security contributions deducted by the employer. Directors can choose to continue to be treated as self-employed for five years if they opt-in before 31 December 2024.
