## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
Panama's tax system is based on a territorial concept of income. Citizens and residents are taxed on income earned from Panamanian sources. Non-residents are taxed only on income from Panamanian sources, and the tax on any type of income paid to a non-resident must be withheld by the payer. Citizens, residents, and non-residents are not taxed on exempt income (i.e. interest on Panamanian government securities, interest on savings accounts, and time deposits maintained with banks established in Panama).
