## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 07 February 2025
For tax purposes, branches are considered separate entities from the head office and must therefore keep accounts separately and will have separate tax liability.
Branches located within the Panamanian territory must pay dividend tax through definitive WHT of 10% of net taxable income generated by the Panamanian branch, less all income taxes paid by the same corporation in Panama. This amount will be paid jointly on filing the corresponding income tax return.
