In Panama, there are no group taxation rules.
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing obligation is extended to all the transactions carried out with related parties located abroad or under a special tax regime in Panama. There is an obligation to file an annual Transfer Pricing Informative Return (‘Form 930’), which includes all the operations carried out with related parties during the fiscal year under analysis. This report should be filed six months after the fiscal year has ended. The non-submission of this Form will be penalised with a fine equivalent to 1% of the total sum of operations carried out with related parties and will never exceed USD 1 million.
Regarding transfer pricing documentation, the taxpayer must present the Local File and Master File, in case the Panamanian Tax Authority requires it, within 45 working days, starting a day after the notification. The tax authorities are allowed to fine those taxpayers that fail to present the transfer pricing documentation; fines ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 Panamanian balboas (PAB) will be applied the first time, from PAB 5,000 to PAB 10,000 in case of recurrence, and the closure of the establishment for 2 to 15 days in case of non-compliance.
