In addition, COVID-19 vaccines, which have been approved by the European Commission or by other member-states, are subject to 0% VAT.
Supplies of goods and services to VAT-registered persons established in EU countries (intra-Community supplies) are not subject to VAT (zero rated). Exports of goods and services connected to exports to non-EU countries are VAT exempt (zero rated).
Real estate leases are generally exempt from VAT. However, commercial leases and lease contracts for shopping centres and logistics centres may be subject to VAT on the condition that the lessor opts for the taxation of the lease under VAT either prior to or after the commencement of the lease by filing a relevant application. 
Furthermore, VAT will be suspended until 31 December 2025 and real estate transfer tax will be levied on all unsold real estate with a construction permit issued (or revised) from 1 January 2006 onwards, upon relevant application by taxable persons.
As of July 2021, new VAT rules were introduced in relation to the new One-Stop Shop (OSS) scheme and the Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS).
The main changes are the following:
Online sellers, including online marketplaces/platforms can register in one EU member state and this will be valid for the declaration and payment of VAT on all distance sales of goods and cross-border supplies of services to customers within the European Union.
The existing thresholds for distance sales of goods within the European Union were abolished and replaced by a new EU-wide threshold of EUR 10,000. Below this EUR 10,000 threshold, the supplies of telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic (TBE) services and distance sales of goods within the European Union may remain subject to VAT in the member state where the taxable person is established.
Special provisions are introduced whereby online marketplaces/platforms facilitating supplies of goods are deemed for VAT purposes to have received and supplied the goods themselves ('deemed supplier').
In addition, new record keeping requirements are introduced for online marketplaces/platforms facilitating supplies of goods and services, including where such online marketplaces/platform are not a deemed supplier.
The VAT exemption at importation of small consignments of a value up to EUR 22 has been removed. This means all goods imported in the European Union will now be subject to VAT.
A new special scheme for distance sales of low goods imported from third territories or third countries has been created. The IOSS has been created to simplify the declaration and payment of VAT. 
Finally, simplification measures for distance sales of imported goods in consignments not exceeding EUR 150 has been introduced, in case the IOSS is not used (special arrangements).
## Customs duties
Many goods imported into Greece from outside the European Union are subject to customs duties. The rates of duty are provided by the EU’s Common Customs Tariff.
## Excise taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on energy and electricity products (e.g. petrol, natural gas, electricity), manufactured tobacco, alcoholic products, coffee, liquids used in electronic cigarettes, and the tobacco contained in electrically heated tobacco products. The tax rates vary depending on the category of products.
In addition, consumption tax has been introduced on the following products: (i) the substrate or container of nicotine or nicotine and other substances, or other substances without nicotine, in solid form contained in electrically heated non-tobacco products and (ii) the substrate of nicotine or nicotine and other substances in solid form contained in ’nicotine pouches‘.
## Environmental taxes
A special plastic bag duty is imposed on consumers per piece of thin plastic bag they use (except for biodegradable bags, which are not subject to this duty). The rate of the duty is 7 cents per plastic carrier bag.
Furthermore, the application of a uniform call rate, at 80 cents per kilogram, to the weight of plastic packaging waste that is generated in each member state and is not recycled was introduced through Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 of 14 December 2020, which was implemented in Greece by L. 4783/2021.
An environmental protection levy of 4 cents (per product) is imposed on the plastic products that are available as packaging of food and beverages during their sale by mass catering companies or by retail companies. In plastic products, the plastic cover or lid is considered as a distinct product, for which the levy is imposed separately.
Moreover, a recycling duty was introduced by virtue of Art. 80 of L. 4819/2021, imposing on consumers as of 1 June 2022 a duty of 8 cents per piece the packaging of which contains polyvinyl chloride (PVC).

Lastly, following Law 5162/2024 (the new Tax law) the climate resilience fee has been increased ranging from 0.50 to 5.00 Euros on the hospitality services sector (i.e. main hotel accommodation, rented furnished rooms, properties made available through short-term rentals, in case of self-catering accommodation - tourist furnished villas), which is levied per day of use and per room or apartment. 
## Uniform Tax on the Ownership of Real Estate Property (ENFIA)
The ownership of real estate property/property rights in Greece is subject to the ENFIA, which consists of a principal tax imposed on each real estate property and a supplementary tax imposed on the total value of the property rights on real estate property of the taxpayer subject to tax.
More specifically, said tax is not imposed on the objective value of real estate property, but is determined on the basis of various factors, according to the final registration of the property at the land registry or ownership title.
The principal tax on buildings is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the building by the principal tax ranging from EUR 2 to EUR 16.20 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The principal tax on land is calculated by multiplying the square metres of the land by the principal tax ranging from EUR 0.0037 to EUR 9.2500 per square metre and other coefficients affecting the value of the property (e.g. location, use).
The supplementary tax is imposed on the total value of the rights to property at a rate of 5.5‰. Self-used real estate is taxed at the reduced rate of 1‰.
Pursuant the provisions of the new tax Law 5162/2024, starting from the year 2025, the Unified Property Tax (ENFIA) for insuredindividuals' residences will be reduced by 20%, provided that the taxable value of the property does not exceed 500,000 euros. If the property's value exceeds this threshold, the reduction remains at 10%. To qualify for this exemption, the insurance must cover the previous year andhave a minimum duration of three months. If the insurance duration is less than one year, the real estate tax reduction will be applied proportionally. 
## Real estate transfer tax
Each transfer of real estate, which is not subject to VAT, is subject to real estate transfer tax. The real estate transfer tax is imposed at a rate of 3% on the taxable value of the property (increased by a municipality surcharge to a total rate of 3.09%).
## Abolition of Stamp taxes-Introduction of Digital Transaction Duty
Law 5135/2024 abolishes the Stamp Duty and introduces the Digital Transaction Duty into Greek tax legislation, which will be imposed on transactions and contracts from December 1, 2024, onwards.
The Digital Transaction Duty is imposed on loan agreements at a rate of 2.4%, with a cap of €150,000 per loan. It is clarified that the Digital Transaction Duty is not imposed, among others, on loan interest, bond loans under Law 4548/2018, and bank loans.
Rentals of non-residential properties are subject to 3.6% digital transaction duty (with the exception of shopping centres and logistics centres subject to VAT).
Other digital transaction duties may apply in certain limited cases.
## Capital accumulation tax following incorporation
Capital accumulation tax applies on any capital accumulation transactions, at a rate that has been recently reduced to 0.2% as regards transactions for which the tax liability arises from 11 December 2023 onwards. In particular, said tax is imposed on capital accumulation (share capital increase) by:
  * commercial companies and joint ventures
  * any type of association and any other form of company, legal entity, or union of persons or society aiming to make profits, and
  * branches of foreign companies (unless of EU origin).


For Greek _Société Anonyme_ (SA) companies, an additional 0.1% duty on capital is payable to the competition committee.
The capital accumulation tax is not imposed upon the incorporation/establishment of legal entities.
## Payroll taxes
Employers are liable to submit payroll withholding taxes on monthly salary payments (following the grossing-up to the yearly salary) at the following tax scale:
Taxable income (EUR) | Tax rate (%)  
---|---  
Up to 10,000 | 9  
10,001 to 20,000 | 22  
20,001 to 30,000 | 28  
30,001 to 40,000 | 36  
Above 40,000 | 44  
Reductions may apply depending on the amount of the annual taxable income received by individual taxpayers and by the number of the dependent children the individual taxpayer has.
Benefits in kind are, in principle, subject to payroll taxes. However, to the extent that it is difficult to proceed to an evaluation of such benefits at the time of their granting, no employment withholdings are effected thereon, instead their value (assuming such benefits are taxable) shall be added to the employment income of the beneficiaries and be taxed upon the clearance of the annual income tax return filed by the employees.
## Social security contributions
Social security contributions are due on salary and benefits in cash or in kind granted by an employer to its employees, with the exception of specifically enumerated extraordinary benefits of social character (e.g. marriage gifts, birth gifts). More specifically, as per the benefits in kind, said benefits might only be exempted from social security contributions as long as they are offered:
i) voluntarily by the employer and for the better serving of the employer's operational needs, also contributing to the increase of the employees' productivity and the better quality of the employee's workplace,or
ii) the constitute a measure adopted for the hygiene and safety of the employees, as well as
iii) they are offered personally to the employees and not in cash.
