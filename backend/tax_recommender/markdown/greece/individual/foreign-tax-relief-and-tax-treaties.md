## Foreign tax relief
Income tax paid abroad is deductible from Greek tax only under the conditions that:
  * the taxpayer files a Greek tax return as a Greek tax resident
  * the taxpayer submits to the tax office the original supporting documentation (i.e. foreign income tax return and tax payment notice) for this transaction bearing the seal of Apostille per Hague Convention and being officially translated into Greek, and
  * the foreign country has the right to apply tax on the income.


Said deduction, however, cannot exceed the part of income tax that would be attributable had this income (i.e. foreign income) been earned by Greek sources.
## Tax Treaties
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Greece has signed a DTT_.
