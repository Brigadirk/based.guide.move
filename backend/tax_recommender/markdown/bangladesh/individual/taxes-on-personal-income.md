## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Taxation of individuals in Bangladesh is primarily based on their residential status in the relevant tax year. The residential status of individuals is determined independently for each tax year and is ascertained on the basis of their physical presence in Bangladesh during the relevant tax year and past years.  _See the_ _section for more information_.
Under Bangladesh tax laws, the scope of taxation differs as per the residential status of an individual.
  * For a resident person, income is taxable in Bangladesh if it is accrued or arisen or deemed to be accrued or arisen in Bangladesh. Income is taxable if it is received or deemed to be received in Bangladesh. Income from outside Bangladesh that is accrued, arisen, or received by or on behalf of the person in the same year is also taxable.
  * For a non-resident person, income is taxable if it is accrued or arisen or deemed to be accrued or arisen in Bangladesh or received or deemed to be received in Bangladesh during the year.
