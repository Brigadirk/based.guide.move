## Treatment of flow-through business entities
Partnership firms are taxed as individuals. The post tax income of a partnership firm is distributed proportionately among the partners.
## Exchange controls
As per the Bangladesh Bank Guidelines, foreign nationals who are resident in Bangladesh and who have an income in Bangladesh are permitted to make monthly remittances to the country of their domicile out of their current savings up to 80% of their net income to cover their commitments abroad. The term ‘net income’, in this context, signifies the gross income of the applicant less all compulsory deductions such as income tax, provident fund (if any), house rent, and other deductions that are of a fixed nature.
## Expatriate issues

  * Tax Payment Certificate: This certifies that the individual has no tax liabilities under the relevant tax laws.

## Work permits
A work permit is mandatory for foreign nationals for employment in any industrial, commercial, educational, sports, or government entity and private sector or for investors residing and operating businesses in Bangladesh. BIDA takes into consideration national security concerns while issuing work permits. Moreover, they discourage the issuance of work permits in favour of foreign nationals if they do not have specialised knowledge and hi-tech proficiency. The conditions stipulated in the work permit govern the remuneration break-up for individuals in Bangladesh as well as other allied requirements, i.e. funding of the assignee’s salary, enlistment with Bangladesh Bank, etc. Prior to making an application for the issuance of a work permit, the entity making the application must specify the remuneration details of the assignee, i.e. break-up of salary, amount to be paid in Bangladesh, amount of salary to be paid in the assignee’s home country, etc. Any deviation from the work permit is not desirable and may be required to be explained and justified with the regulatory and tax authorities.
BIDA generally issues work permits to personnel expected to stay for at least six months in Bangladesh. In case the individual is required to return prior to the expiry of the stipulated tenure, an application has to be made out to BIDA for cancellation of the work permit.
## Tax equalisation
Whether tax would be borne by the company or the individual will depend upon the terms of employment. The domestic tax laws do not contain any specific provision in this regard.
