Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
## Social security contributions
Provident fund and gratuity are the major social security contributions. Social security is broadly governed by the Bangladesh Labor Act, 2006.
An establishment in the private sector will be required to constitute a provident fund for the benefit of its workers if at least three-fourths of the total number of workers employed therein so demand to the employer by an application in writing.
Employees (including foreign nationals) working with an establishment in Bangladesh to which the social security regulations apply are liable to contribute towards the provident fund at the fixed rate of 7% to 8% of salary. The employer is required to make a matching contribution and deposit both the employer’s and employee’s contributions to the provident fund of the employee every month.
Gratuity is payable to workers on the termination of employment, in addition to any compensation or wages or allowance payable on termination of employment.
