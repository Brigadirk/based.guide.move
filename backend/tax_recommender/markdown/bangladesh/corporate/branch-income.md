The tax rate will be as applicable to an unlisted company on net income (i.e. income less allowable expenses).
## Branch profit remittance tax
Remittance of profits (after tax) earned by a branch to its head office attracts a branch profit tax at 20% of such remittance. The remittance is not allowed by the authorised dealer bank unless the branch profit tax has been duly deposited.
