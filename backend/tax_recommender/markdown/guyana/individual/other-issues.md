## Exchange control
There are no exchange control rules in Guyana.
## Temporary visas
Visas are issued under the following five categories and are valid for multiple periods of three months, up to a maximum of three years:
  * Diplomatic. 
  * Courtesy. 
  * Business. 
  * Tourist. 
  * Student. 


## Work permits
A foreign national seeking employment in Guyana is required to apply for a work permit. Guyana's work permit policy is informal due to the small population. Because of the growing demand for skilled labour, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the agency responsible for issuing work permits, responds promptly to applications. It may waive some of the normal procedures, such as advertising in the local paper, when it is known that the desired skills are not readily available.
A work permit is good for the duration of an expatriate's contract, up to a maximum of three years.
## Residence permits
Most residence permits are valid for one year, but permits may be obtained that are valid for up to three years. Residence permits are renewable, and the renewed permit may be valid for a maximum of three years.
