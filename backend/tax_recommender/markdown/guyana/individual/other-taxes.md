## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains tax is charged at the rate of 20% on the net capital gain arising from a change of ownership of assets by an individual. Capital gains arising from the sale of property used for a private residence where the proceeds from the sale are used for the purchase of another property for a private residence of equal or greater value during the year of assessment or within 60 days of the end of the year in which the property is sold is not subject to capital gains tax. Capital gains arising from the disposal of shares in public companies are exempt.
The gain is calculated by deducting from the sales proceeds the cost of the asset. However, if the asset was acquired before 1 January 2011, then the market value of the asset at 1 January 2011 is substituted for the cost. Gains on assets disposed of within 12 months of acquisition are generally taxed as income.
