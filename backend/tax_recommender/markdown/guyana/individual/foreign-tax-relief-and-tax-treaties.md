## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
## Foreign tax relief
A credit is available for foreign taxes paid on income from an office, employment, or profits. The total credit granted may not exceed the total tax payable by a taxpayer in any year of assessment. For the purposes of computing the tax payable on total income, no deduction is allowed for foreign tax paid. Any foreign income chargeable to Guyana tax on a remittance basis is grossed up to include foreign tax paid.
Double tax relief as provided in an applicable treaty is also available where an individual derives income from a country with which Guyana has concluded a DTT.
