## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 14 October 2024
There is no provision under the legislation for group taxation in Guyana. All companies are taxed separately.
## Transfer pricing
There is no transfer pricing legislation or rules in Guyana, although the issue has been discussed and is expected to be more formally considered in the future. However, the current Act contains a general anti-avoidance provision, and the tax authority monitors multinationals to ensure that their transactions are conducted at armâ€™s length and in conformance with the applicable tax legislation.
## Thin capitalisation
There are no thin capitalisation rules in Guyana.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
CFCs are not covered under Guyana tax laws.
