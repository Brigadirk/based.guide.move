As a result of the increase of the tax-free amount, the amount decreasing tax has increased. As of 1 July 2022, it amounts to PLN 300 per month
### Child relief
In the tax return for 2025, the taxpayer may deduct:
  * PLN 92.67 per month (i.e. up to PLN 1,112.04 per year) for a pro-family allowance for raising one child who meets the conditions of the allowance, assuming that the taxpayer's income, after deducting social security contributions, does not exceed PLN 112,000 in total, and for a non-married person, including for part of the tax year, does not exceed the amount of PLN 56,000 in the tax year.
  * PLN 92.67 per month (i.e. up to PLN 1,112.04 per year) for the second child.
  * PLN 166.67 per month (i.e. up to PLN 2,000.04 per year) for the third child.
  * PLN 225.00 a month (i.e. up to PLN 2,700.00 per year) for raising the fourth and subsequent child.


If a child was in the taxpayersâ€™ custody only for a period of time during the taxable period, the allowance is proportionally lowered.
The annual income limit for an adult, studying child, beyond which the parent loses the possibility of deducting the child allowance amounts for 2024 to PLN 21,371.52, i.e. 12 times the social pension value for December 2024 (this amount is variable every year, depending on the amount of social pension set for December of a given year).
