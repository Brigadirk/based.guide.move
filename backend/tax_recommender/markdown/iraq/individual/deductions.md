Under the tax law, deductible annual allowances for salaries received are as follows:
  * An amount equal to 100% of salaries received from the government, public institutions, and local authorities. 
  * Contributions to a social security system. 
  * The Iraqi tax authorities allow an exemption from tax in relation to ’risk allowances’; in practice, such allowances should not exceed 30% of the basic salary.

Personal allowances for a married person | 4,500,000
