## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 19 January 2025
In general, all expenses incurred by the taxpayer in order to produce income during the year are deducted from income, provided that such expenses are confirmed by acceptable documents, with some exceptions.
## Depreciation
The Iraqi Depreciation Committee sets the maximum depreciation rates for various types of fixed assets (please contact us for additional information regarding the specific rates). If the rates used for accounting purposes are greater than the prescribed rates, the excess is disallowed.
The depreciation method is either a straight-line method or declining-balance method.
## Goodwill
Iraqi tax law does not contain a provision that covers the deductibility of goodwill.
## Start-up expenses

Losses cannot be carried back.
