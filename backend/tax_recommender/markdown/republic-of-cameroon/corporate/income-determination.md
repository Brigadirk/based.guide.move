## Inventory valuation
For valuation purpose, the GTC only provides that stocks shall be valued at cost price; however, if the market price is lower than the cost price, the undertaking shall make provisions for depreciation of inventory. No reference is made to the accounting method that shall be used (e.g. first in first out [FIFO], last in first out [LIFO]). Only FIFO and weighted average methods are allowed under the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) Accounting Principles. Where there is any difference between the valuation method permitted by the GTC and the book valuation, the accounting result shall be modified accordingly.
Firms shall, by 15 March, submit a summary of all the stock movements of the financial year concerned, together with the software used in managing the said stock. The summary of inventory movements should be produced in dematerialised form.
The right of ascertainment of stocks by the tax administration shall allow tax officers to conduct unannounced on-site operations to physically audit the stocks of one or several products of the non-prescribed period. A notice of passage shall be remitted to the taxpayer or representative during the first intervention within the framework of such audit.
