  * Relaxation of the conditions for deducting head office and technical assistance costs for new companies with a deficit and companies with a continuing deficit.


  * Non-deductibility of losses resulting from the transfer of the liabilities of the dissolved company in the event of a change of activities following restructuring is confirmed.
  * Replacement of the ‘Tax Clearance Certificate‘ by the ’Tax Compliance Certificate‘, which attests not only to the payment of taxes due but also to taxpayers' compliance with their other reporting obligations.
  * Automation of the procedure for issuing withholding tax (WHT) certificates.
  * Deductibility of losses resulting from the transfer of liabilities from the dissolved company to the absorbing company in the event of a change of activities following restructuring.
