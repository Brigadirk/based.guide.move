The local branch of any foreign company is taxed at the same rate as a company. The net profits (after CIT) of entities having their residence or head office outside Cameroon (such as the branch of a foreign company) are assumed to be distributed each fiscal year to companies not located in Cameroon. Their net profits (after CIT) shall therefore be subject to the WHT on distributions at 16.5%.
