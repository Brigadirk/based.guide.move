# South Africa
## Overview
Last reviewed - 11 December 2024
South Africa, which became a republic in 1961 and transitioned to a constitutional democracy in 1994, is a middle-income, emerging market with an abundant supply of natural resources, such as gold, platinum, and diamonds. It has well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the 16th largest in the world and the largest in Africa by market capitalisation. South Africa's currency is the rand (ZAR). South Africa has 12 official languages, including English, and three capitals: Pretoria (administrative), Bloemfontein (judicial), and Cape Town (legislative).
Following a substantial slowdown in economic growth resulting from the global financial crisis of 2007/08 (South Africa experienced negative growth of nearly 2% in 2009), the South African economy experienced a muted recovery, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth peaking at 2.2% in 2013. From 2014 to 2019 GDP growth ranged between 0.2% and 1.5%. In 2020, GDP shrank by 6.4% in real terms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. GDP growth for 2021 and 2022 was 4.9% and 2%, respectively, while the economy grew at 0.6% in 2023. The 2024 growth forecast remains at 1.1%.
The Monetary Policy Committee of the SARB has a targeted inflation band of 3% to 6%. The average inflation rate for 2023 was 6.0%. Headline inflation dipped in 2024 to 2.8% (October 2024) and is projected to stay below 4% until mid-2025.
