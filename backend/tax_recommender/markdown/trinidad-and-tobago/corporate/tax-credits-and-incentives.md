Exemption may be total or partial. Subject to approval, profits may be distributed tax free to shareholders, except in the case of certain non-resident shareholders, where the relief is restricted to the amount of tax that exceeds their liability in their country of residence. Net losses during the tax holiday period (i.e. the excess of total losses over total profits) may be carried forward for set-off without limitation for five years from the end of the tax holiday period, after which the normal set-off provisions for losses apply.
