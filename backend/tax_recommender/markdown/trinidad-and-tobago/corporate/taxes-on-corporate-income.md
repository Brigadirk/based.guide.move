## Business levy
Corporations are subject to a business levy at the rate of 0.6% of gross revenue or receipts where the levy exceeds the corporation tax liability. Exemption is available for certain companies, including petroleum companies and companies whose annual turnover is less than TTD 360,000. The levy is a non-deductible expense for corporation tax purposes.
The business levy rates for small and medium enterprise (SME) companies listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange, within the first ten years from listing on such stock exchange, are broken down and calculated into five-year periods as follows:
  * 0% for the first five years from listing.
  * 50% of the rate of the business levy for the next five years immediately following the previous period and thereafter at the standard rate.


Effective 1 January 2024, there is an exemption from business levy on revenue earned by a manufacturer from export sales.
## Green fund levy
A green fund levy of 0.3% on gross income is applicable to companies and partnerships doing business in Trinidad and Tobago. This levy is payable quarterly and is neither a deduction in computing chargeable income nor a credit against corporation tax due.
The green fund levy for SME companies listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange shall be calculated as follows:
  * 0% for the first five years from listing.
  * 50% of the rate of the green fund levy for the next five years immediately following the previous period and thereafter at the standard rate.


## Unemployment levy
Only petroleum companies remain liable to the unemployment levy, at the rate of 5% of taxable profits. No set-off for prior-year losses is permitted in computing the liability.
## Supplementary petroleum tax (SPT)
SPT is chargeable on the gross income (derived from the sale of crude oil) less royalties and overriding royalties paid on the crude oil sold. The tax is computed separately in respect of land and marine operations and is a quarterly tax based on the actual gross income for each quarter.
The SPT is deductible in arriving at profits subject to petroleum profits tax.
