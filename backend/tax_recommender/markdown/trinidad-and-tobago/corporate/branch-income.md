## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 31 January 2025
A branch is subject to Trinidad and Tobago taxation on all income directly or indirectly accruing in or derived from Trinidad and Tobago. The tax rates applicable on branch profits are the same as on corporate profits. In addition, branch profits, after deduction of corporation tax and reinvestments, are subject to withholding tax (WHT) at the rate of 3%. This may be varied by the provisions of any applicable DTTs.
