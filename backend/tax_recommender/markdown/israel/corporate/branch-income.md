## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
A branch is liable for tax at the standard corporate rate on Israel-source income. No tax is withheld on transfers of after-tax profits to the foreign head office upon receiving a withholding tax (WHT) clearance from the Israel Tax Authority (ITA).
