## Permanent establishment (PE)
PE has been defined in the Income Tax Act only in the limited context of interest, commercial royalty, and management or consultancy fee. However, PE is defined in all the double taxation agreements (DTAs) that Botswana has entered into with other contracting states. The definition of PE in the DTA follows the definition in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital.
