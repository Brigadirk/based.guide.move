Tax Amnesty, covering CIT and value-added tax (VAT), was granted to all taxpayers covering the tax periods prior to 1 July 2021. The period to apply for amnesty was from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. This tax amnesty provided taxpayers an opportunity to settle outstanding principal tax debt under CIT and VAT assessments due for periods prior to 1 July 2021, with a reciprocal remission of outstanding penalties and interest relating to such amounts. This provided taxpayers a once-off opportunity to regularise CIT and VAT affairs for such historical periods.
### Taxes covered under the tax amnesty
  * VAT.
  * CIT.
  * Personal income tax (PIT).
  * Taxes collected under pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and other withholding tax (OWHT).


### Tax periods covered
In respect of CIT, all tax periods prior to and including the 2020/2021 tax year (i.e. to 30 June 2021) are covered. In respect of VAT, tax liabilities for all tax periods prior to 1 July 2021 are covered.
### The tax amnesty period
The tax amnesty is available from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022.
### Penalties and interest eligible for remission
All interest and penalties charged under the VAT Act are eligible for remission.
All interest and penalties charged under the Income Tax Act are eligible for remission, with the exception of: 
  * penalties charged on non-submission of transfer pricing documentation (Sec.118A), and 
  * penalties on non-submission of additional information (Sec.119B).


No fines (charged under Part XIV of the Income Tax Act) will be waived.

A person shall be eligible for the tax amnesty where such person:
  * has an outstanding principal tax debt that has a relevant penalty and/or interest liability

### Amounts not eligible for remission

## VAT
The VAT rate was initially changed from 12% to 14% on 1 April 2021; however, in an effort to reduce the impact of increasing inflation on the Botswana economy, the Botswana government introduced a temporary measure to alleviate the pressure by reducing the rate from 14% to 12% from 3 August 2022 up to 31 March 2023. The VAT rate reverted to 14% from 1 April 2023.
