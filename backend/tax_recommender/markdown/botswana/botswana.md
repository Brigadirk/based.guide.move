# Botswana
## Overview
Last reviewed - 19 April 2024
The Republic of Botswana, a landlocked country located in Southern Africa, is bordered by Namibia to the north and west, Zimbabwe to the east, and South Africa to the south. Botswana is divided into nine districts and five town councils, with Gaborone as the capital. Setswana and English are widely spoken throughout Botswana, with most official communications in English. The official currency of Botswana is the pula (BWP).
Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name upon independence in 1966. Five decades of uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining, dominates economic activity; however, tourism is a growing sector due to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature preserves.
Botswana has maintained one of the world's best economic growth rates since its independence. Through fiscal discipline and sound management, Botswana transformed itself from one of the least wealthy countries in the world to a prospering upper-income country with a _per capita_ gross domestic product (GDP) of 7,738.9 United States dollars (USD) in 2022. Botswana has been ranked as one of the best credit risks in Africa. Diamond mining has fuelled much of the expansion and currently accounts for one-quarter of GDP, 85% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues. Tourism, financial services, and agriculture are other key sectors.
