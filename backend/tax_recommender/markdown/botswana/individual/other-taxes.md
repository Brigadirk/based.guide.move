## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains for individuals are considered to be from a separate source and are taxed on the basis of the table below.
Capital gains on the disposal of immovable property and marketable securities (including shares in private companies) are taxable in Botswana if the source is in Botswana. For capital gains purposes, the cost of immovable property is adjusted to take account of inflation. For other gains, no inflation allowances are granted, but the taxable gain is set at 75% of the total gain.
