## Foreign tax relief
A tax credit is granted unilaterally where amounts received by a Botswana resident have been subject to taxation in a foreign country and in cases where a double taxation agreement (DTA) has been concluded. A tax credit is also granted where income from a source within Botswana has been subject to a WHT. The amount of the relief is limited to the lesser of the tax paid by deduction and that normally paid in Botswana on such income.
