## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
Residents are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed on income arising in Mozambique.
All individual income (employment income, capital gains, investment income, independent work, rental income, commissions, etc.) is subject to the below tax rates.
## Earned income tax rates
The following are the annual tax rates applicable to individual income:
Annual income (MZN*) | Rate (%) | Deduction (MZN)**  
---|---|---  
Over | Not Over  
0 | 42,000 | 10  
42,000 | 168,000 | 15 | 2,100  
168,000 | 504,000 | 20 | 10,500  
504,000 | 1,512,000 | 25 | 37,500  
1,512,000 | 32 | 141,540  
* Mozambican metical
** Amount deductible after applying rate to whole amount.
For non-Mozambican residents, the earned income tax is withheld and remitted by the employer or other payer at a definitive flat rate of 20% (in the majority of the income received).
## Local income taxes
The municipal tax rate varies depending on the municipality. In the case of Maputo city, the tax amount is MZN 510 for the year 2024. Typically, employers withhold the tax from each employee and remit it to the tax authorities.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
As of 1 January 2014, the family unit is no longer taxed jointly for earned income. Each couple or single individual should declare their own incomes and file the respective annual income tax return.
Employers withhold earned income tax on a monthly basis for work carried out in Mozambique at the WHT rates approved by law, which currently vary from 0% to 32%.
Individual tax returns must be submitted from January to April of the year following the tax year.
If only employment income, paid by a Mozambican entity (and therefore subject to the income tax withholding at source) has been obtained in a tax year, the individual does not have an obligation to file an annual tax return for that tax year.
## Payment of tax
Employers are obligated to collect the amount of earned income tax payable from their employees each month and make payments to the Finance Department within the following month (up to the 20th day of the month).
Payment of any final balance due, after the issue of the tax assessment by the tax authorities, must be made by the end of May (if it refers to employment income) or by the end of June (for other types of income).

## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 09 January 2025
## Personal deductions
After assessment of gross tax, resident taxpayers are allowed to deduct the following amounts:
  * Deductions related to the individual and family status of the taxpayer: 
    * MZN 1,800 for each married or single taxpayer. 
    * MZN 600 for one dependant, MZN 900 for two dependants, MZN 1,200 for three dependants, and MZN 1,800 for four or more dependants. 
  * Deductions of tax credit for international double taxation. 


## Business deductions
Deductions from business income depend on the taxation regime adopted by each taxpayer.
For individuals that are obligated to maintain statutory accounts (turnover above MZN 2.5 million), the assessment of net income is obtained after deductions of various costs connected with the activity, which include, among others, staff costs, rents, depreciation of premises and equipment, fees paid to third parties for services, power and water consumption, travelling expenses of up to 10% of gross earnings, and expenses, in general, that are incurred in the normal course of the activity or business.
Under this limit of annual turnover (i.e. MZN 2.5 million), tax will be accessed according to the simplified taxation regime, under which no costs are deducted against income and the total turnover is taxed according to certain coefficients: 0.2 for sale of goods and the merchandise sector, 0.2 for the accommodation and food and beverage sector, and 0.3 on revenue from all other sectors of activities.

## Employment income
The tax concept of employment income is very broad, including salary and any fringe benefits (in kind or in cash) paid or granted by the employer to its employees. In general, all economic advantages provided to the employee arising from the employment or equivalent relationship are considered remuneration and taxed as employment income under the PIT Code.
With the exception of housing allowances, use of company paid houses, private use of a company car (if a written agreement is signed) attributed on an uncertain and irregular basis, and the gratifications paid by an entity other than the employer, all employment income is subject to monthly withholding taxes (WHTs) on a definitive and final basis, through application of tax rates from 10% to 32%, depending on the gross monthly amounts received and number of dependants, as follows:
Monthly gross income (MZN) | Number of dependants | Coefficient applicable to every additional amount to the lower amount of income  
---|---|---  
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4+  
Up to 20,249.99 | - | - | - | - | - | -  
From 20,250.00 to 20,749.99 | - | - | - | - | - | 0.10  
From 20,750.00 to 20,999.99 | 50 | 0 | - | - | - | 0.10  
From 21,000.00 to 21,249.99 | 75 | 25 | 0 | - | - | 0.10  
From 21,250.00 to 21,749.99 | 100 | 50 | 25 | 0 | - | 0.10  
From 21,750.00 to 22,249.99 | 150 | 100 | 75 | 50 | 0 | 0.10  
From 22,250.00 to 32,749.99 | 200 | 150 | 125 | 100 | 50 | 0.15  
From 32,750.00 to 60,749.99 | 1,775 | 1,725 | 1,700 | 1,675 | 1,625 | 0.20  
From 60,750.00 to 144,749.99 | 7,375 | 7,325 | 7,300 | 7,275 | 7,225 | 0.25  
More than 144,750.00 | 28,375 | 28,325 | 28,300 | 28,275 | 28,225 | 0.32  
The income tax withheld by the employer shall be delivered to the Mozambican Tax Authority (MTA) up to the 20th day of the following month.
Individuals that only earn employment income that is subject to Mozambique WHT on a definitive basis are not required to file an annual income tax return, meaning that there is no additional payment or reimbursement of PIT in respect to employment income (if paid by a Mozambique resident entity). 
For individuals that earn employment income that is not subject to definitive WHT in Mozambique and/or another type of income (rental, freelance income, capital gains, etc.), PIT is assessed on a yearly basis through the completion of the annual tax return (Form 10) in respect to the income obtained in the previous civil year and based on the annual tax rates varying from 10% to 32%, depending of the level of their annual taxable income. The annual tax return must be filed from January to April of the year following the year that income relates to.
## Capital gains
Gains resulting from the following are considered capital gains:
  * The transfer of rights regarding immovable property and similar acts.
  * The transfer of shareholdings and other securities.
  * The selling of intellectual and industrial property and know-how.
  * The transfer of contractual positions or other rights inherent in contracts regarding immovable property.
  * Net income from operations in regard to financial instruments.


Capital gains are taxed as follows:
  * 50% of the positive or negative balance resulting from the onerous transfer of rights or contractual positions regarding immovable property and intellectual and industrial property, including know-how, is taxable.
  * In the case of gains or losses resulting from the onerous transfer of shareholdings, the percentage of the value to be considered for tax purposes is proportional to the time the taxpayer has held the shareholdings, namely:


    * 100% of value if held for up to 12 months
    * 85% of value if held between 12 and 24 months
    * 65% of value if held between 24 and 60 months, and
    * 55% of value if held for more than 60 months.


Capital gains are taxed at the year end, jointly with other income, at the annual tax rates established, which vary from 10% to 32%.
## Capital investment income
The following income is considered as capital investment income:
  * Interest and other remuneration from capital.
  * Interest and premiums on the write down or disposal of securities.
  * Interest on shareholders loans and on profits not distributed to shareholders.
  * Income from shareholdings.
  * Income from intellectual property and from know-how if not earned by the original owner.
  * Income from life insurance contracts.


Most capital investment income is taxed through withholding by the paying entity at 20% with exceptions for income from debit bonds and interests from bank deposits, which are taxed at 10%.
