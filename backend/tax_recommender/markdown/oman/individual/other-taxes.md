## Social security contributions
A 17.5% social security contribution is applicable to employees who are Omani nationals, but not to expatriate employees. The employee pays a contribution of 7% of salary, and the employer pays the balance of 10.5%. The employer is also required to contribute for insurance for work-related injuries in the amount of 1% of the salary of the employee. This brings the total monthly social security and insurance contributions to be made by the employer to 11.5%.
From January 2021, employers and Omani employees are each required to make a monthly salary contribution at the rate of 1 Omani rial (OMR) per OMR 100 of monthly salary (or 1% of payment) as part of the job security scheme implemented. This brings the total social security contribution to 20.5% of which the employee pays a contribution of 8% and the employer pays the balance of 12.5%.
