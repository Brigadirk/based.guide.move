## Foreign tax relief
There is currently no PIT law enacted in Oman; consequently, foreign tax relief is not separately provided for under Oman domestic tax law. However, specific rules under a particular double tax treaty (DTT) in force between Oman and another country should be referred to.
## Tax treaties
Oman has DTTs with the following countries:
Belarus | Italy | Qatar | Thailand

Canada | Korea | Seychelles | Turkey  
China | Lebanon | Singapore | United Kingdom
