The tax rate for branches of foreign entities (regardless of country) is a flat 15%.
Expenses incurred by the head office that can be identified as directly related to the branch’s activity are deductible. The deduction for other head office expenses is limited to 3% of the branch’s gross income for the year. This rate is 5% for banks and insurance companies, and 10% for high-tech industrial activities.
