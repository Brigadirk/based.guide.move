The Oman Tax Authority (OTA) had previously implemented the Digital Tax Stamp system for excisable products, including cigarettes, shisha, and other tobacco products. In July 2023, the OTA aimed to expand this system to encompass carbonated drinks, energy drinks, and sweetened beverages. However, this initiative was subsequently suspended. In October 2024, the OTA decided to enforce the provisions for carbonated beverages, sweetened beverages, and energy drinks, effective from 1 February 2025.
On 31 December 2024, Oman announced the implementation of a minimum top-up tax of 15% on multinational enterprise (MNE) groups in line with global rules to combat base erosion and profit shifting. This step is taken as a commitment to Pillar 2, which aims to ensure an appropriate level of tax is paid by MNEs through a series of measures aimed at modernising the international tax system.
