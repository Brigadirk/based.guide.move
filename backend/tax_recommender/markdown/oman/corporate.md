## Corporate - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
On 30 May 2024, the Sultanate of Oman and the Republic of Ireland (‘the contracting states‘) signed a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). The DTAA was ratified by Ireland on 20 September 2024 and by the Sultanate of Oman on 19 November 2024 vide Royal Decree RD 60/2024. The DTAA shall be effective from the following dates:
  * For withholding taxes (WHTs): The first day of January following the date on which the DTAA enters into force.
  * For other taxes: The tax year commencing on or after first day of January following the date on which the DTAA enters into force.


On 27 October 2024, the Sultanate of Oman and the Republic of Estonia (‘the contracting states‘) signed a DTAA. Furthermore, the DTAA was ratified on 10 December 2024. The date that this agreement goes into effect is subject to completion of administrative procedures.
On 8 December 2024, the Sultanate of Oman and the Republic of Cyprus (‘the contracting states‘) signed a DTAA. The date that this agreement goes into effect is subject to completion of administrative procedures. 
On 15 December 2024, the Sultanate of Oman and the Republic of Tanzania (‘the contracting states‘) signed a DTAA. The date that this agreement goes into effect is subject to completion of administrative procedures. 
The Oman Tax Authority (OTA) had previously implemented the Digital Tax Stamp system for excisable products, including cigarettes, shisha, and other tobacco products. In July 2023, the OTA aimed to expand this system to encompass carbonated drinks, energy drinks, and sweetened beverages. However, this initiative was subsequently suspended. In October 2024, the OTA decided to enforce the provisions for carbonated beverages, sweetened beverages, and energy drinks, effective from 1 February 2025.
On 31 December 2024, Oman announced the implementation of a minimum top-up tax of 15% on multinational enterprise (MNE) groups in line with global rules to combat base erosion and profit shifting. This step is taken as a commitment to Pillar 2, which aims to ensure an appropriate level of tax is paid by MNEs through a series of measures aimed at modernising the international tax system.

## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
## Taxable period
The tax year is the calendar year. Assessments can be made on the basis of a year-end other than 31 December, provided permission is granted in advance by the OTA and the company then adheres to the year-end on a consistent basis. The first tax year of a taxpayer can be up to a period of 18 months.
## Tax returns
Currently, a single ‘return of income’ needs to be filed within four months from financial year close. Reasonable time extensions may be sought at the discretion of the OTA for filing the annual returns of income, but these do not defer payment of tax, which will be subject to additional tax at 1% per month from the due date to the actual date of payment.
The annual return of income should be accompanied by audited accounts signed by an auditor registered in Oman. The law requires accounts to be drawn up in accordance with IFRS or any similar standards as approved by the OTA and consistently applied. It specifically provides for accrual accounting unless prior permission of the OTA has been obtained. The accounts must be submitted in local currency unless prior approval of the OTA has been obtained for submitting them in foreign currency.
In the case of SMEs falling in the category of the 3% tax rate, the tax returns must be filed and accompanied by a simplified income statement within three months of the year-end.
Delay or failure in submitting the annual return may attract a penalty of not less than OMR 100 and not more than OMR 2,000.
Failure to file the annual return of income may result in an estimated profit assessment by the OTA.
Failure to submit audited accounts as required under the Law is deemed to result in an incomplete annual return of income and may attract an estimated profit assessment. The requirement of submitting audited financial statements has been relaxed for SME taxpayers who fall in the category of the 3% tax rate.
The law confers wide powers on the OTA for requesting information. Experience has shown that, notwithstanding the presentation of audited accounts, the tax department requests very detailed information and supporting documentation relating to revenue and expenses. Failure to provide such information or the provision of incorrect information can result in an additional assessment by the OTA and/or various penalties on the company and/or the officer responsible for providing the information.
## Payment of tax
Tax should be paid with the final return of income due within four months of the year-end. Failure to pay taxes by the due date attracts interest at the rate of 1% per month from the date on which such tax was due to the date of payment.
Please note that taxpayers have the option of payment of taxes in instalments, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and prior approval from the TA. 
The difference between the amount paid and the amount assessed, subject to filing of an objection, should be paid within one month from the date of the assessment. The additional amount assessed attracts interest at the rate of 1% per month from the date on which such tax was due to the date of payment.
Under the Law, the OTA has the authority, with the approval of the Minister and the Tax Committee, to sequester and sell the assets of a taxable entity to recover the taxes due.
If decisive proof is presented to the OTA that any person has paid tax for any year exceeding the tax due and payable for such tax year as finally settled, such person has the right to recover the tax. However, if any tax has become payable by such a person in respect of another tax year, the excess amount will be adjusted against the future tax liability. Any request for recovery must be presented within five years from the end of the tax year in which the right to refund arises; otherwise, such right shall lapse.
Where the taxpayer fails to declare correct income in the tax return for any tax year, the OTA may impose a fine in the range of 1% to 25% of the difference between the amount on the basis of the correct taxable income and the amount of tax as per the return submitted.
## Objections and appeals
A company has a right to object to any assessment issued by the OTA. The objection document should be prepared in writing (in English and in Arabic) and filed with the office of the OTA within 45 days from the date of assessment. The OTA is required to give a judgment within five months, extendable up to another three months at the OTA’s discretion, from the date of receiving the objection. The tax demanded may be kept in abeyance on request. No additional tax is payable until the OTA issues the judgment.
Once the objection decision is issued, the tax is payable immediately and no further deferment is available. A grievance can be filed with the Tax Grievance Committee within 45 days from the date of the objection decision.
The Law permits the taxpayer to file tax suit before the Primary Court against the decision issued by the Tax Grievance Committee within 45 days from the date of serving the notification of the Committee’s decision. Either the OTA or the taxpayer may contest against a judgement issued by the Primary Court through appeal before the Court of Appeal and then before the Supreme Court. The provisions of the Civil and Commercial Procedures Law shall apply for matters not covered in the Income Tax Law when hearing and making final judgement over the tax suit.
## Statute of limitations
The Royal Decree 9/2017 introduced the self-assessment regime, where the assessments are carried out on a sample basis and the statute of limitation is three years from the end of the year in which a tax return is submitted. Where the entity has not submitted the tax returns, the OTA has a period of five years to complete the assessments.
## Maintenance of records
The Law requires accounting records and supporting documentation to be maintained for ten years after the end of the accounting period to which these records relate.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Related-party transactions are likely to attract particular scrutiny by the OTA. Taxpayers should maintain extensive documentation that proves that transactions are carried on at arm’s length.


# Oman
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
The term ‘resident’ is not defined in the tax law.
However, tax residency has been defined in the context of WHT provisions as:
  * A natural person who is present for a continuous or intermittent period of not less than 183 days in a year.
  * A legal person established in Oman / with main or actual headquarters located in Oman.


## Permanent establishment (PE)
PE is defined in very broad terms and includes places of sale, places of management, branches, offices, factories, workshops, mines, quarries, other places of extraction of natural resources, and a building site, place of construction, or assembly project (if it continues for more than 90 days). However, the mere use of storage or display facilities does not constitute a PE. The definition of PE references carrying on business in Oman, either directly or through a dependent agent.
Additionally, the definition stipulates that a total stay of 90 days during a 12-month period creates a PE in Oman. However, this 90-day period applies to rendering of consultancy services or other services only. Under this definition, while the sale of goods into Oman will not be deemed to be a taxable activity, a contract for the supply and installation of equipment is likely to attract tax. By the same criterion, services rendered by personnel visiting Oman will be treated as taxable activities, applying the 90-day rule.

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
## Depreciation
Depreciation is taken on a straight-line basis on the following classes of assets at the annual rates shown.
Asset | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Permanent buildings | 4  
Semi-permanent buildings | 15  
Docks, quays, jetties, sea barriers in ports, pipelines, roads, and railway lines | 10  
Aircraft and ships | 15  
Hospital buildings, educational establishments, and equipment for scientific research | 100  
The rate of depreciation allowed is doubled in the case of buildings used for industrial purposes.
The tax law also provides for calculation of depreciation on a net book value basis for the following classes of assets. A 'pooling' concept is permitted, whereby assets subject to the same rate of depreciation may be pooled together for purposes of depreciation.
Pool | Rate (%)  
---|---  
First pool is comprised of tractors, cranes, and other heavy machinery and equipment, including computer software installations, furniture and fixtures, vehicles, computer software, and intellectual property (IP) rights | 33.33  
Second pool is comprised of drilling equipment | 10  
Third pool is comprised of 'other machinery and equipment' not included above | 15  
## Goodwill
Goodwill is amortisable for tax purposes, generally over the life assigned for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting purposes.
## Start-up expenses
Expenses incurred before the commencement of business are allowed as a deduction in the first year of commencement of operations (or period).
## Interest expenses
Deduction of expenses incurred for the purpose of earning income is generally allowed. Interest expense is allowed for loans from unrelated parties or on loans from banks. Interest paid to related parties is allowed only to the extent the loan terms are at arm's length and subject to satisfaction of the 2:1 debt-to-equity ratio (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_).
## Bad debts and other contingencies
Amounts charged to the profit and loss account for creating provisions in respect of bad debts, stock obsolescence, warranties, and similar types of contingencies are not tax deductible. Deduction is allowed only at the time of write-off or write back. However, provisions created by licensed banks in respect of bad debts are allowable within the limits approved/required by the Central Bank of Oman.
## Charitable contributions
Charitable donations (in cash or kind) are limited to specified institutions and organisations and are subject to an overall limitation of 5% of gross income.
## Meals, entertainment, officers’ compensation, etc.
All expenses incurred for the generation of gross total income are allowed. There are no specific restrictions on deduction for expenses like meals and entertainment, compensation for officers, and life insurance payments for employees. There are limits on the deductibility of directors' fees.
## Social security payments
Social security contributions paid by employers in respect of employees may also be deducted.
## Pension payments
Contributions to pension funds, domestic and foreign, are deductible, provided the fund is licensed (in Oman or the country where it was established) and complies with certain other specified conditions.
## Illegal payments

## Fines and penalties
Civil fines and penalties are not deductible.
## Taxes
Taxes on income, whether incurred in Oman or elsewhere, are not deductible in arriving at taxable income. A credit may be available for taxes paid in a foreign jurisdiction.
## Other significant items/restrictions on allowable expenses
The tax law has imposed restrictions on the deductibility of certain other expenses. The principal items affected are the following:
  * Sponsorship fees paid to Omani sponsors are restricted to 5% of net taxable income before sponsorship fees. Net taxable income is determined after offsetting any losses carried forward.
  * Charges or expenses allocated from the head office or other group companies are limited to 3% of gross income (5% for banks and insurance companies, and 10% for high-tech industrial activities).
  * Commissions paid by insurance companies are restricted to 25% of net premiums collected.
  * Leasing companies are treated at par with banks as far as deduction for loan loss provision is concerned. Leasing companies are allowed deductions for loan loss provisions, subject to the limits or recommendations of the Central Bank of Oman.
  * Losses arising on sale of investments listed on the Muscat Security Market are not allowed as a deduction from taxable income.
  * Any expense or costs that have been incurred to generate income exempted from tax are not allowed as a deduction from taxable income.
  * Amounts paid as tax consultancy or advisory fees are disallowed.
  * For leases classified under IFRS 16, amortisation of right-of-use (ROU) assets and interest on lease liability are disallowed, with an allowance for actual lease rental payments.


## Net operating losses
Carryforward of losses is limited to five years, except in the case of companies that incurred losses during a mandatory tax-exempt period, where the net losses may be carried forward indefinitely for offset against future profits.
Carryback of losses is not allowed.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Payments to foreign affiliates normally receive in-depth scrutiny from the tax authorities. Accordingly, proper documentation should be obtained in order to establish that these transactions are made at an arm's-length basis.


# Oman
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
Businesses are taxed as separate entities, and the tax law does not recognise group taxation.
## Transfer pricing
Transactions between related parties must be valued at arm’s length. There is no specific guidance on acceptable methods for determining an arm’s-length price.
### Country-by-country (CbC) reporting
Oman introduced CbC reporting requirements applicable for reporting years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Further, please note that, although the OTA announced the suspension of 'local filing' requirements for multinational groups headquartered outside Oman till further notice, other obligations (i.e. CbC notification requirements) will continue to apply.
## Inter-company payments
All inter-company payments are scrutinised in detail to ensure that the profits are not transferred to avoid payment of tax.
## Thin capitalisation
If the debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 2:1 in the case of related-party debt, interest on the excess debt is not deductible for tax purposes. This rule does not apply to banks and insurance companies, PEs of foreign companies, or proprietary (Omani owned) establishments.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
There is no CFC regime in Oman.


# Oman
## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
The tax rate for branches of foreign entities (regardless of country) is a flat 15%.
Expenses incurred by the head office that can be identified as directly related to the branch’s activity are deductible. The deduction for other head office expenses is limited to 3% of the branch’s gross income for the year. This rate is 5% for banks and insurance companies, and 10% for high-tech industrial activities.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit
A foreign tax credit is available to Omani companies or establishments (proprietorships) that suffer foreign taxes on income that is also taxed in Oman. The credit is limited to the amount of tax incurred in Oman. The taxpayer is required to submit an application to the OTA to claim such credit.
## Exempt activities
Effective for tax years beginning after 31 December 2016, tax exemptions are available only for industrial (manufacturing) activities. Exemptions are no longer available for mining, export of locally manufactured goods, operation of hotels and tourist villages, agriculture, fishing, or education.
In addition, new industrial exemptions are limited to the initial five-year period, with no renewal.
Existing tax exemptions are not impacted, but the changes will look to impact pending renewal applications.
Further, companies registered with the Special Economic Zones and Freezones in Oman may be able to avail 25 to 30 years of tax exemptions, subject to meeting certain conditions.
_See Exempt income in the section for a description of other income items exempt from tax_.


# Oman
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
Foreign companies that do not have a PE in Oman for tax purposes and that derive income from Oman in the nature of the following are subject to WHT at 10% of gross income from such sources:
  * Royalties.
  * Consideration for research and development.
  * Consideration for the use of or right to use computer software.
  * Management fees.
  * Provision of services (with defined exclusions).


While dividends and interest were initially included in the list above, a Royal Directive issued by His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik on the occasion of Accession Day on 11 January 2023 called for the complete suspension of WHT on the distribution of dividends and interest on non-resident investors. 
The OTA also announced the suspension of WHT that was imposed on the lease of ships, aircraft, and aircraft engines, effective from 29 December 2022.
WHT is required to be withheld by the Omani-based company and paid to the tax department within 14 days of the end of the month in which tax is deducted or payments are due or made to the foreign company.
Under clarifications issued by the OTA, WHT on dividends applies only to dividends paid by joint stock companies, not LLCs.
As of 1 March 2018, WHT on services applies whether the services are performed in Oman or abroad. Previously, the tax authorities had taken a position that services performed entirely outside Oman were not subject to WHT.
The term 'royalty' has been defined under the law to include consideration for the use of IP, including computer software, cinematography films, tapes, discs, or any other media, patents, trademarks, drawings, etc. The term further includes consideration for using industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment and consideration for information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience or consideration for granting rights to exploit mining or other natural resources.
## Double tax treaties (DTTs)
The maximum WHT rates provided by the Oman DTTs are shown in the table below. There are also agreements with various countries that are not yet in force.
The table provides a summary of WHT rates under Oman tax treaties in force as of 1 December 2018. Under some treaties, dividends qualify for a reduced WHT rate if the beneficial owner is a corporation that owns a specified percentage of the voting power of the distributing corporation. Also, under some treaties, a lower WHT rate applies to interest on government debt or government-assisted debt.

The Oman tax law does not contain rules on deferral of foreign income.


# Oman
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 01 January 2025
The Income Tax Law seeks to tax worldwide income of entities formed in Oman and the Oman-source income of branches and other forms of permanent establishment (PE).
The rate of income tax is uniform for all types of business entities, regardless of whether it is a corporate entity and/or whether it is registered or not.
The income tax rate is 15% for all taxpayers other than Omani proprietorships (‘establishments’) and limited liability companies (LLCs) that fulfil the conditions of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
For Omani proprietorships (‘establishments’) and LLCs that meet the following requirements:
  * registered capital does not exceed 50,000 Omani rial (OMR) at the beginning of the tax year
  * gross income does not exceed OMR 100,000 for any tax year
  * average number of employees during the tax year does not exceed 15, and
  * taxpayer activities do not include air/sea transport; extraction of natural resources; banking, insurance, or financial services; public utility concessions; or other activities to be decided by the Minister of Finance after approval by the Council of Ministers,


a 3% tax rate is effective and is coupled with a requirement for SME taxpayers to file income tax returns.
## Petroleum income tax
Special provisions are applicable to the taxation of income derived from the sale of petroleum. The tax rate specified for such companies is 55%. However, the tax rates are applied on income as determined by the individual Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement entered into between the government of Oman and the company engaged in the sale of petroleum. Under these agreements, the government pays the company’s share of income tax from amounts withheld from the government’s share of production. Consequently, the income tax is not actually borne by the company.
## Local income taxes
There are no regional or local income taxes in Oman.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
On 12 October 2020, His Majesty issued Royal Decree no. 121/2020 in relation to the implementation of VAT in Oman, and it was published in the Official Gazette on 18 October 2020. VAT has been implemented in Oman with effect from 16 April 2021. The standard rate of VAT in Oman is 5% and consistent with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Unified Agreement, and there are provisions for zero rating and exemptions in the Oman VAT Law. By global standards, 5% is one of the lowest VAT rates implemented in the world.
### VAT rate
The standard rate of 5% VAT will apply on goods and services supplied in Oman, subject to specific exemptions and zero ratings prescribed under Oman VAT law.
Exempt supplies are not subject to VAT, and the input tax in relation to exempt supplies cannot be recovered. Examples of exempt supplies include certain financial services, local passenger transportation services, education services, renting of residential property, etc.
Zero-rated supplies are subject to VAT at 0%, and the supplier can avail input VAT credit in respect of goods / services used for making zero-rated supplies. Examples of zero-rated supplies include export of goods and services outside Oman, international transportation services, basic food items, etc.
### VAT registration
Registration for VAT is an online process.
There is a mandatory registration requirement if the total value of annual supplies exceeds or is expected to exceed OMR 38,500. There is a voluntary registration threshold if the total value of annual supplies / expenditure exceeds or is expected to exceed OMR 19,250. 
### VAT return
Taxpayers are required to file a VAT return and make payment of VAT liability on a quarterly basis. The due date for filing of VAT return and making payment of VAT liability is 30 days from the end of the quarter.
If the due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, the due date for filing of a VAT return and making payment of VAT will be extended to the next working day.
The late payment of VAT liability is subject to additional tax at 1% per month or part thereof, whereas a delayed filing of VAT return is subject to administrative penalty ranging from OMR 500 to OMR 5,000. 
The OTA has released VAT guides for certain industries (e.g. financial services, oil and gas, education services, healthcare, transportation services, real estate) to provide further guidance in terms of industry-specific VAT implications. Also, further VAT guides are expected to be issued in the near future.
### Statute of limitations
As per the Oman VAT law, the OTA cannot assess the tax after completion of five years from the due date of a tax period (due date is 30 days from the end of tax period). The period will be extended to ten years in cases where registration is not made within the prescribed time limits.
### VAT record maintenance
VAT records are required to be maintained for a period of ten years by the businesses. However, the businesses in the real estate sector are required to maintain records for up to 15 years. VAT records mainly include sales and purchase invoices, accounting records, customs documents, inventory records, etc. 
A taxpayer is allowed to maintain electronic records, subject to conditions prescribed under the Oman VAT Executive Regulations. 
A taxpayer may keep accounting records, books, invoices, and other documents / records in any language, provided that they are made available in Arabic language upon the request of the OTA.
## Customs duty
Customs duty is applicable on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of imports for most non-GCC sourced goods, unless there is any preferential treatment under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed between Oman and a foreign country.
Standard rate of customs duty is 5%. However, there are certain goods that are subject to customs duty at different rates.
### Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) Program
The AEO program provides traders with the opportunity to partner with the customs authorities and secure benefits within their supply chain. All businesses operating in Oman can apply and benefit from the AEO program, subject to the fulfilment of the required criteria. Benefits of obtaining AEO certification include simplified verification of documents during customs clearance, exports and imports pass through express lines, priority in inspections, and faster cargo clearance process.
We encourage businesses engaged in import and export activities in Oman to explore the advantages of joining the AEO partnership program. This is a fantastic opportunity to ensure compliance with customs regulations, while benefiting from a strong governance of your international supply chain operations across your business.
## Excise taxes
