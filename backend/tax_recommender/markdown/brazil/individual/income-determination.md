Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Employment income
Taxable compensation includes everything that is either directly or indirectly connected with the work and/or assignment remuneration package, including salary, premiums, bonuses, allowances of any kind, tax reimbursements, club dues, and company-owned cars.
## Equity compensation
The income tax on stock options is due by individual residents in Brazil on the positive spread between the grant price and the fair market value at the time of exercise as well as upon the sale of the shares, where the sale results in a capital gain. Further implications must be observed in case the costs are recharged to the Brazilian entity.
## Business income
Income arising from work without an employment relationship, when paid by legal entities and cooperatives, is subject to income tax withheld at source based on the progressive table mentioned in the _section_.
## Dividend income
Dividend income received from Brazilian companies, relating to profits derived from 1996 onwards, is tax exempt. Dividend income received from investments made abroad, however, is subject to monthly income tax payments.
## Interest income
Interest income received from Brazilian investments is subject to income tax withholding at source. The tax rate ranges from 15% to 22.5%, depending on the term of the investment. Interest income received from investments made abroad is subject to tax calculations on a monthly basis.
