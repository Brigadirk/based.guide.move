Last reviewed - 26 December 2022
## Foreign tax relief
Tax credits are available with respect to income tax paid to countries with which Brazil has a ratified tax treaty or to countries that would render reciprocal treatment in relation to income tax paid to the Brazilian government, provided that some requirements are met.
## Tax treaties
Brazil signed tax treaties to avoid double taxation with the following countries: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia (*), Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay (*), Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad & Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay (*), and Venezuela.
(*) Treaties pending ratification (not yet in force).
In the case of the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, the Brazilian authorities have already officially recognised the reciprocity of tax treatment, which permits the offsetting of the tax paid in those countries against the tax due in Brazil, on the same earnings.
