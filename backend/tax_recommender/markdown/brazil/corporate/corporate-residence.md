## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 29 October 2024
A legal entity is considered resident in Brazil if it has been incorporated in Brazil, and its tax domicile is where its head office is located.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The specific term ‘permanent establishment’ is not included in the Brazilian legislation, rather there is a concept of ‘taxable presence’.
In general, a non-resident company may be treated as having a taxable presence if it operates in Brazil either through: (i) a fixed place of business or (ii) an agent who has the power to enter into contracts in Brazil in the name of or on behalf of the non-resident.
