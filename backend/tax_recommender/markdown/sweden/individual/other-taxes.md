## Social security contributions
Employers pay Swedish employer social security contributions on compensation paid to employees who are covered by the Swedish social security system.Social security contributions are levied at 31.42% of the total taxable remuneration (no cap) in cash and in kind paid by a Swedish employer or a foreign employer with a PE in Sweden. Foreign employers who do not have a PE in Sweden must register for the payment of social security contributions or may enter into an agreement with the employee that the employee pays and reports the contributions on a monthly basis. Different rates apply depending on which solution is used.
A pension fee of 7 % of gross earned income, up to SEK 650,442 (i.e a maximum fee of SEK 45,530), is payable by the employee, but the fee is normally fully tax creditable on the employeeâ€™s tax return (i.e. the effective cost for the employee is normally nil).
