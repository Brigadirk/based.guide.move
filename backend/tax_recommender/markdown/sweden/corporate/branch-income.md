## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 27 December 2024
Branch income (i.e. PE income) is taxed at the corporate tax rate of 20.6% (_see State [national] income tax in the section_), and general corporate tax rules apply for branch offices in Sweden. No withholding tax (WHT) is levied on the outbound repatriation of taxed profits.
The receipt of Swedish-source royalties or fees for use of tangible or intangible assets by a foreign resident is also (subject to treaty restrictions) regarded as a special form of PE income.
