## Foreign tax relief
If during a tax year the resident taxpayer of the PIT realises tax income from sources outside the territory of the Republic of Albania, the tax to be paid by that taxpayer for this income must be deducted from the amount of the tax paid in a foreign country on this income. The deducted amount of foreign tax paid cannot exceed the amount of PIT that would be payable for this income if it had been realised in the territory of the Republic of Albania.
The foreign tax credit must be calculated separately for each country if the income is realised from foreign sources in more than one country.
The foreign tax credit must be calculated separately for the income included in the annual tax base and for the annual investment income.
Income tax can be credited based on the DTTs in force, up to the level of income tax rate applicable in Albania.
