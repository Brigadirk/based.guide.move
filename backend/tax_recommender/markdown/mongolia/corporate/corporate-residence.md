Last reviewed - 06 January 2025
A resident taxpayer of Mongolia includes any economic entity incorporated under Mongolian law or a foreign entity with its effective place of management in Mongolia.
A foreign entity is considered to have its effective place of management in Mongolia if it meets at least three of the following criteria:
  * More than 50% of its shareholders, or shareholders who exercise their rights and responsibilities directly or indirectly through representatives, reside in Mongolia.
  * Over the past four consecutive years prior to the current tax year, more than 50% of shareholder meetings have been held in Mongolia.
  * The company’s accounting and financial records are maintained in Mongolia.
  * At least 25% of the Board of Directors (BOD) members, or those who exercise BOD rights and responsibilities directly or indirectly through representatives, reside in Mongolia.
  * At least 60% of the company’s total sales revenue is earned in or sourced from Mongolia.


A non-resident company is a foreign entity that conducts its business in Mongolia and earns income from Mongolian sources.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The new CIT law includes an expanded definition of 'permanent establishment' (PE) that aligns with international tax rules. A PE is now defined as a unit through which the business activities of a foreign entity are wholly or partly carried out. The specified types of PE are as follows:
  * Construction PE: Constituted for a building site, construction, installation, or assembly project, including connected supervisory services, if it lasts for 90 or more days within a consecutive 12-month period.
  * Service PE: Constituted if a foreign entity provides services, including technical, consultancy, management, supervision, or other services (through a non-resident's employees or contracted personnel) to a resident taxpayer for 183 or more days within a consecutive 12-month period.
  * Agency PE: Constituted if a person carries out the following activities in Mongolia on behalf of a non-resident taxpayer: (i) storing, selling, or supplying goods, and (ii) concluding a contract or playing the principal role leading to the conclusion of a contract without material modification to the main terms or conditions of the non-resident’s contract.


Detailed guidance on PE, including registration and tax reporting aspects, has been issued by the tax authorities.
