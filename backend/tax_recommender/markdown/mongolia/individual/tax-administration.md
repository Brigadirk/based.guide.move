## Tax returns and payments
In general, if an employee (local or expatriate) receives employment income from a Mongolian employer, the responsibility for reporting, withholding, and payment lies with that employer. If an employee receives other income (e.g. income from the sale of shares) or if there is no Mongolian employer, the responsibility for reporting, withholding, and payment lies with the employee. The tax agent (i.e. employer) should transfer the tax withheld from a taxpayerâ€™s income to the budget by the tenth day of the following month.
Furthermore, a tax agent should submit a quarter-to-date report of tax withheld by the 20th day of the first month of the following quarter and year-to-date tax report by 15 February of the following year to the corresponding tax authority. Income should be reported on an individual tax form and submitted to the tax authority by 15 February of the following year.
