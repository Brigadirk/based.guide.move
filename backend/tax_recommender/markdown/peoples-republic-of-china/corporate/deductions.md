## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Generally, an enterprise is allowed to deduct reasonable expenditures that actually have been incurred and are related to the generation of income.
## Depreciation of fixed assets
Fixed assets with useful lives of more than 12 months must be capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the CIT regulations. Generally, depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method. Production-nature biological assets, such as livestock held for breeding and commercial timber, also have to be capitalised and depreciated using the straight-line method.
Under the straight-line method, the cost of an item, less its residual value, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Residual value should be reasonably determined based on the nature and usage of the asset. The CIT law provides minimum useful lives for the following assets:
Assets | Years  
---|---  
Buildings and structures | 20  
Aircraft, trains, vessels, machinery, mechanisms, and other production equipment | 10  
Appliances, tools, and furniture etc. related to production and business operations | 5  
Means of transport other than aircraft, trains, and vessels | 4  
Electronic equipment | 3  
Production-nature biological assets in the nature of forestry | 10  
Production-nature biological assets in the nature of livestock | 3  
Shorter tax depreciation life or accelerated depreciation is allowed for particular types of fixed assets (e.g. fixed assets that need to be replaced more frequently due to advancement of technology, fixed assets that suffer from constant vibration or severe corrosion).
New fixed assets acquired by companies engaging in manufacturing industries and new fixed assets and equipment acquired specifically for R&D purposes may be depreciated over a shorter period or under an accelerated depreciation method.
Where a shorter depreciation period method is applied, the minimum depreciation period cannot be less than 60% of the minimum depreciation period as prescribed in the CIT Law; where an accelerated depreciation method is applied, the double-declining-balance method or sum-of-years-digits method can be used.
The following capital expenditure may be expensed-off in one lump sum in the year of acquisition:
  * Newly acquired instruments and equipment for the purpose of R&D activities by all enterprises, with unit value not exceeding CNY 1 million, and newly acquired instruments and equipment used in both R&D and operating activities by small-scale and thin-profit manufacturing enterprises, with unit value not exceeding CNY 1 million may be expensed in one lump sum for CIT.
  * From 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2027, newly acquired fixed assets, other than real estate properties, with unit value not exceeding CNY 5 million may be expensed in one lump sum for CIT.
  * Newly acquired fixed assets (excluding real estate properties) and intangible assets by enterprises in Hainan (from 2020 to 2024) and Hengqin with unit value not exceeding CNY 5 million may be expensed in one lump sum for CIT.


## Amortisation of intangibles and goodwill
A deduction is allowed for amortisation of intangible assets, such as, but not limited to, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and land-use rights. Generally, intangible assets have to be amortised over a period of not less than ten years. For an intangible asset obtained through capital contribution or assignment, it can be amortised according to the useful life prescribed in the laws or agreed in the contracts, if any. However, acquired goodwill is not deductible until the invested enterprise is entirely transferred or liquidated.
