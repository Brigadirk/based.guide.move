## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Non-TREs without establishments or places of business in China shall be subject to a WHT at 10% on gross income from dividends, interest, lease of property, royalties, and other China-source passive income unless reduced under a tax treaty.
If a non-TRE shareholder uses dividends distributed from a China TRE to make direct investment into China or acquire a China TRE from third parties, the non-TRE shareholder is eligible for WHT deferral treatment on the dividends, provided that certain conditions are met. The non-TRE shareholder shall report and settle the deferred tax if it later recoups the investment through equity transfer, equity buyback, liquidation of the China TRE, etc.
Dividends distributed by a foreign investment enterprise out of its pre-2008 profit to non-TRE shareholders are still exempted from WHT.
WHT rates under Chinaâ€™s tax treaties with other countries/nations are as follows (as of 31 December 2024):
