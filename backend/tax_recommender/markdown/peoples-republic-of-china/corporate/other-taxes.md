For taxpayers that are eligible for the above zero rate, generally they may be entitled to a credit or refund of the input VAT incurred.
The VAT refund rate for exported services is the same as the applicable VAT rate. For exported goods, the VAT refund rates range from 0% to 13%. There is a prescribed formula for determining the amount of refund, under which full refund of input VAT is not available to many exported goods and the exporter will suffer different degrees of export VAT costs.
In addition, certain taxable activities, including a few types of sale of goods, services, and cross-border transactions, are applicable to the VAT exemption treatment. In that respect, the relevant input VAT incurred cannot be credited or refunded.
The rate for small-scale VAT payers is 3%. From 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2027, the VAT rate for small-scale VAT payers is reduced from 3% to 1%.
## Customs duties
Import and export customs duty is levied on goods that are allowed to be imported into or exported based on the relevant customs regulations. The Consignee of imported goods, consignor of export goods, and owner of entry articles are parties held liable for paying customs duties.
The customs classification of import and export goods is the base for the customs supervision, customs taxation, and customs statistics. In 2022, along with the revisions of the classified catalogue in ‘International Convention for Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System’ made by World Customs Organisation (WCO), large scale adjustments have been made to China’s import and export tariff system.
Import duty is charged in _ad valorem_ , specific, compound, or sliding terms, etc. _Ad valorem_ duty is charged based on the customs valuation of the goods. The dutiable value of the goods is multiplied by an _ad valorem_ duty rate to arrive at the amount of duty payable. Duty collection on an _ad valorem_ basis is the main taxation measure used by most countries, including China. The dutiable value of import and export goods is the taxable value determined by the Customs to levy _ad valorem_ duties on the import and export goods, which is the base to value and levy customs duties payable of import and export goods and import links taxes payable of the import goods.
Import duties are categorised as normal tariff rate, Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate, contractual tariff rate, preferential tariff rate, tariff-rate quota (TRQ) rate, and temporary tariff rate.
The Country of Origin of imported goods also plays a part in determining the applicability of a number of other trade policies, such as TRQ, preferential tariffs, anti-dumping duty, anti-subsidy duty, etc.
Import and export goods are reduced with or exempted from customs duties, import VAT, and consumption tax according to state regulations.
The importation of raw materials under processing trade is bonded, and customs duty, import VAT, and consumption tax exemption is allowed on the part to be re-exported after processing.
For goods that enter into and exit from the customs special supervision zone, import duties, import VAT, and consumption tax are held over at the time of importation, which are to be exempted for exportation and to be paid for sales from the customs special supervision zone to domestic markets.
