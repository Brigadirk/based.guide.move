An individual is usually a small-scale VAT taxpayer subject to the VAT rate of 3%. However, individuals engaged in privately-owned business may be recognised as general VAT taxpayers as long as certain criteria, such as sales amount, etc., have been met. Unlike general VAT taxpayers, small-scale taxpayers are not allowed to claim input VAT credits for the VAT paid on their purchases.
Individuals are exempt from VAT if the income derived is below certain thresholds. The provincial level tax bureaus are authorised to determine the exact thresholds within the following ranges:
  * Monthly sales amount of no more than CNY 100,000 for registered VAT payer.
  * Sales amount of no more than CNY 300 or CNY 500 per transaction/day if the individual is subject to VAT on a transaction basis and not a registered VAT payer.

## Land appreciation tax

## Customs duties
Import and export customs duty is levied on goods that are allowed to be imported into or exported based on the relevant customs regulations. The Consignee of imported goods, consignor of export goods, and owner of entry articles are parties held liable for paying customs duties.
The customs classification of import and export goods is the base for the customs supervision, customs taxation, and customs statistics. In 2022, along with the revisions of the classified catalogue in ‘International Convention for Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System’ made by World Customs Organisation (WCO), large scale adjustments have been made to China’s import and export tariff system.
Import duty is charged in  _ad valorem_ , specific, compound, or sliding terms, etc.  _Ad valorem_ duty is charged based on the customs valuation of the goods. The dutiable value of the goods is multiplied by an  _ad valorem_ duty rate to arrive at the amount of duty payable. Duty collection on an  _ad valorem_ basis is the main taxation measure used by most countries, including China. The dutiable value of import and export goods is the taxable value determined by the Customs to levy  _ad valorem_ duties on the import and export goods, which is the base to value and levy customs duties payable of import and export goods and import links taxes payable of the import goods.
Import duties are categorised as normal tariff rate, Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate, contractual tariff rate, preferential tariff rate, tariff-rate quota (TRQ) rate, and temporary tariff rate.
The Country of Origin of imported goods also plays a part in determining the applicability of a number of other trade policies, such as TRQ, preferential tariffs, anti-dumping duty, anti-subsidy duty, etc.
Import and export goods are reduced with or exempted from customs duties, import VAT, and consumption tax according to state regulations.
The importation of raw materials under processing trade is bonded, and customs duty, import VAT, and consumption tax exemption is allowed on the part to be re-exported after processing.
For goods that enter into and exit from the customs special supervision zone, import duties, import VAT, and consumption tax are held over at the time of importation, which are to be exempted for exportation and to be paid for sales from the customs special supervision zone to domestic markets.
