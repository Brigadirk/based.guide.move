## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 03 January 2025
Residents are generally subject to China individual income tax (IIT) on their worldwide income. Non-residents are generally taxed in China on their China-source income only (_see the section for more information_).
An individual is taxed in China on one's income by category. China's IIT law groups personal income into 9 categories.
The 9 categories of income are:
  1. Employment income (i.e. wages and salaries). 
  2. Remuneration for labour services. 
  3. Author's remuneration. 
  4. Royalties. 
  5. Business income. 
  6. Interest, dividends, and profit distribution. 
  7. Rental income. 
  8. Income from transfer of property. 
  9. Incidental income. 


Each income category has its own tax rate(s), allowable deductions, etc.
For residents, employment income, remuneration for labour services, author’s remuneration, and royalties are combined as 'comprehensive income' for aggregate tax calculation purpose on an annual basis. Income from the other categories is taxed separately by category on a monthly or transaction basis.
For non-residents, income from each of the 9 categories is taxed separately on a monthly or transaction basis.
## Personal income tax rates
### Comprehensive income tax rates
For residents, calculation of IIT on annual comprehensive income is based on progressive tax rates (_see Table I below_) using the following formula:
(Annual taxable income x Tax rate) - Quick deduction
#### Table I
Annual taxable income (CNY*) (1) | Tax rate (%) | Quick deduction (CNY)  
---|---|---  
0 to 36,000 | 3 | 0  
Over 36,000 to 144,000 | 10 | 2,520  
Over 144,000 to 300,000 | 20 | 16,920  
Over 300,000 to 420,000 | 25 | 31,920  
Over 420,000 to 660,000 | 30 | 52,920  
Over 660,000 to 960,000 | 35 | 85,920  
Over 960,000 | 45 | 181,920
