### Standard basic deduction
As of 1 January 2019, the amount of the standard basic deduction is CNY 60,000 _per annum_ (i.e. CNY 5,000 for monthly tax withholding purpose).
### Specific deductions
Chinese social security contributions made in accordance with the Social Security Law and contributions made to the statutory Housing Fund are deductible for IIT purpose.

Child education | 2,000 per child per month  
Continued education | 400 per month or 3,600 per year depending on the type of qualified continued education  
Mortgage interest | 1,000 per month

### Other allowable deductions 
There are also certain deductible items specifically provided by various IIT regulations, such as employee contributions to qualified corporate annuities, premiums paid to commercial health insurance eligible for IIT incentives, premiums paid to commercial endowment insurance or contribution made to individual pension accounts eligible for IIT deferral treatment, etc.
## Personal deductions from employment income for non-residents
When calculating taxable employment income for non-residents, IIT law only allows the standard basic deduction of CNY 5,000 per month.
## Charitable contributions
If an individual makes charitable contributions to qualified domestic non-profit organisations, such contributions are generally deductible to the extent of 30% of one's taxable income reported. This deduction is applicable to all categories of income.
## Remuneration for labour services, author's remuneration, and royalties
A deduction equal to 20% of the gross receipt is allowed when determining the income from labour services, author's remuneration, and royalties. A further deduction of 30% is allowable for authorâ€™s remuneration.
## Rental income
The following deductions are provided for rental income:
  * If the amount received in a month is not more than CNY 4,000, a deduction of CNY 800 is allowed.
  * If the amount received in a month exceeds CNY 4,000, a deduction equal to 20% of the gross receipt is allowed.


## Business deductions
There are specific and complex tax rules to address the deductions available for income derived from the operation of privately-owned businesses, sole proprietorship enterprises, and partnerships. Certain deduction caps are similar to those applicable to companies that are subject to corporate income tax.
In addition, for individuals who derive both comprehensive income and business income during the tax year, the standard basic deduction of CNY 60,000, specific deductions, specific additional deductions, and other allowable deductions (i.e. personal deductions applicable to comprehensive income) are allowed to be deducted from either income category provided that no double deduction is claimed.
## Income from the transfer of property (capital gain)
For sales of property, the original cost of the property and reasonable expenses incurred are deductible from the sales proceeds to arrive at the taxable income.
## Losses
Generally, capital losses are not allowed to be set off against other income or carried forward to other years.
Losses from privately-owned business and sole proprietorship enterprise can be carried forward for five years.
