## Foreign tax relief
Foreign taxes paid on non-China-source income may be claimed as a credit on the China tax return, but only to the extent of the IIT payable on the same category of income derived from the same country. Unused excess credits are non-refundable and can only be carried forward for a maximum of five years. Documentary evidence of the tax payment (e.g. tax payment certificate, tax clearance certificate) to substantiate claims of foreign tax credits is required by the Chinese tax authorities.
