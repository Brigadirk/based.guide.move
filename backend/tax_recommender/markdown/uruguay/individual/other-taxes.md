## Net wealth tax (NWT)
NWT is not only levied on corporate taxpayers but also on the net wealth of individuals (resident or not) located In Uruguay at the end of each civil year at a progressive scale of rates that will depend on their residence. In this sense, while resident individuals will be subject to NWT at a scale of rates from 0.1% to 0.2%, the scale of rates applicable to non-residents individuals are from 0.7% to 1.5%.
Different rules for asset valuation, liabilities, and deductions are applicable to this category of taxpayers.
Furthermore, there is a threshold under which the local net wealth of the individual is considered exempt (currently amounts to approximately USD 155,000). This tax can be paid as a family unit, and, in such cases, the threshold is doubled.
