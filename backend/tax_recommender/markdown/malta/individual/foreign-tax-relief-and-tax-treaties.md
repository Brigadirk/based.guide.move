Last reviewed - 03 February 2025
## Foreign tax relief
There are no special credits for short-term residents. Income taxes paid abroad on income that becomes taxable in the hands of a Maltese resident may qualify for a credit if a double taxation treaty (DTT) has been concluded with the relevant country or under the unilateral relief provisions of Maltese law.
## Tax treaties
_See the section in the Corporate tax summary for a list of countries with which Malta has a DTT_.
