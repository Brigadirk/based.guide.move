  * Individuals for whom employment income subject to wage tax is the only source of income are not obligated to file income tax returns. However, such individuals may obtain a partial refund of taxes by filing an income tax return where they have incurred deductible business or special expenses or did not have a constant salary for 12 months.
  * A sole earner credit can be applied as follows: If a married couple with a single income has one child and is entitled to the family allowance for more than six months, the monthly reduction amount is EUR 50.08, with two children it is by EUR 67.75, it increases for the third and each further child by EUR 22.33. For married couples without children, the sole earner credit is not applicable.
  * Tax rates applicable to monthly salaries are based on the above-listed income tax rates.
  * The 13th- and 14th-month salaries (‘special payments’) are subject to social security deductions (_see Social security contributions in the_ _section for more information_). The first EUR 620 is tax exempt; from the remaining amount, tax is withheld at a graduated rate between 6% and 55% (_see Employment income in the_ _section for more information_).
