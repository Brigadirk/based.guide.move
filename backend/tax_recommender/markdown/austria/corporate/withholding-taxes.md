# Austria
## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Dividend WHT
Under Austrian domestic law, there is generally a 23% WHT for corporations (24% in 2023, 25% until 2022) and 27.5% WHT for other recipients on dividends (profit distributions) paid to a foreign parent company. The WHT has to be deducted and forwarded by the Austrian subsidiary to the tax office.
To end up with the reduced WHT rate as defined under the DTT applicable, Austrian tax law provides for the following alternative methods of WHT relief: refund method or exemption at source method.
### Refund method
The Austrian subsidiary generally has to withhold 23% WHT (for corporations) or 27.5% WHT (for other recipients) on profit distributions to the foreign parent company, and the parent company has to apply for a refund (of the difference between 23% or 27.5% WHT and the lower DTT rate). In the course of the refund process, the Austrian tax administration analyses whether the foreign shareholder can be qualified as beneficial owner of the dividends paid. If the refund is approved by the Austrian tax authority, dividend distributions within the following three years can be done without deduction of WHT (for distributions of a comparable size and provided the foreign holding structure did not change in the meantime).
### Exemption at source method
Relief at source is available only if the direct parent company, within one year after the dividend distribution, issues a written declaration confirming that it is an ‘active’ company carrying out an active business that goes beyond the level of pure asset management (holding activities, group financing, etc.) and has its own employees and office space at its disposal (substance requirements).
### WHT on dividends paid to EU companies
With regard to dividends paid to EU resident corporate shareholders, Austria has implemented the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive according to which domestic WHT is reduced to zero. The requirements for the reduction are that the EU resident parent company, which also has to meet the substance requirements mentioned above (_see Exemption at source method_) at the moment of the dividend distribution, must directly own at least 10% of the share capital of the Austrian subsidiary for a period of at least one year. In case of foreign EU shareholders being qualified as pure holding or passive asset management companies, the Austrian tax administration does not allow an exemption at source but claims the application of the refund method.
Provided the requirements according to the EU Parent/Subsidiary Directive are not met, Austrian WHT has to be deducted. If an EU parent company cannot credit the Austrian WHT deducted against the CIT of its resident state (e.g. because the foreign dividend income is exempted from the CIT or due to a loss position of the shareholder), it is entitled to apply for a refund of the Austrian WHT. This application has to include a confirmation/documentation that the Austrian WHT could (fully or partly) not be credited at the level of the parent company.
## Repayment of equity
The tax-wise equity of a company has to be reported annually to the Austrian tax authority as part of the CIT return (equity account, so-called ‘ _Evidenzkonto_ ’). This equity can be repaid to the domestic or foreign shareholders without triggering Austrian WHT. However, the tax-wise classification of a dividend as ‘capital repayment’ has to be shown in the company’s equity account and be reported in a separate tax return.
For repayments and dividend distributions, the taxpayer has the possibility to choose whether a dividend for tax purposes should be treated either as dividend distribution or as repayment of equity. The execution of the option for treating dividends as dividend distribution requires a sufficient level of retained earnings while a classification as equity payment requires a positive level of tax-wise 'disposable' equity (in addition to the formal requirements outlined above).
## Interest WHT
Interest payments to non-resident companies are currently not subject to WHT (under Austrian tax law, irrespective of any DTT being applicable).
Interest on Austrian bank deposits received by individuals resident in the European Union is not subject to WHT, as Austria agreed on the automatic exchange of information (according to directive 2014/107/EU).
Interest (accrued) on Austrian bank deposits or Austrian bonds received by non-resident individuals, where the paying/depositary agent is located in Austria, is subject to 23% WHT (27.5% WHT for Austrian bonds). A tax exemption applies if an automatic system regarding the exchange of information is available and WHT has to be withheld.
## Royalties WHT
On royalties paid to a non-resident company, Austrian WHT at a rate of 20% has to be deducted. This tax rate can be reduced under an applicable DTT or under the application of the EU Interest Royalty Directive, which was implemented in Austrian Tax Law (_please see Refund method and Exemption at source method under Dividend WHT above for further details_).
## WHT for residents
The following table lists the WHT rates for resident recipients.
Recipient  | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends | Interest | Royalties, licences  
**Residents:**  
Corporations | 0/23 (1) | 0/23 (2) | 0  
Individuals | 27.5 (3) | 0/25/27.5 (4) |  0  
Notes
  1. If the recipient holds a participation of less than 10% in the distributing company, the dividends are subject to 23% WHT (24% in 2023, 25% until 2022). Since dividends distributed by an Austrian corporation to another Austrian corporation are generally not subject to taxation, the WHT is credited against CIT upon assessment of the recipient corporation for the respective tax year.
  2. Interest on cash deposits in euros or foreign currency in bank accounts, on fixed interest-bearing securities in foreign currency (issued after 31 December 1988), and on fixed interest-bearing securities denominated in Austrian schillings or euros (issued after 31 December 1983) are subject to 23% WHT. Companies receiving interest payments may obtain an exemption from WHT if they provide the bank or other custodial agent with a written confirmation from the recipient that such interest payments constitute a part of the recipient’s operating revenues (exemption statement).
  3. WHT on dividends from Austrian companies is final, i.e. no further income tax is collected from the recipient (provided it is an individual).
  4. Interest on Austrian bank deposits (or Austrian bonds), where the paying/depositary agent is located in Austria, is subject to 25% WHT (27.5% WHT on Austrian bonds). If the recipient is an individual, this WHT is final (no further income taxation and inheritance taxation). 


## WHT for non-residents 
The following table lists the WHT rates for non-resident recipients if no tax treaty is applicable.
Recipient | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends (1) | Interest | Royalties, licences  
**Non-residents:**  
**Non-treaty:**  
Corporations and business enterprises  | 23 | 0 (2) | 20  
Individuals | 27.5 | 0/25/27.5 (3) | 20  
Notes
  1. 23% WHT for corporations (24% in 2023, 25% until 2022) and 27.5% WHT for other recipients.
  2. Interest payments to non-resident corporations without a PE in Austria are generally not subject to WHT (provided the loan is not secured via Austrian land property). For interest payments between affiliated companies, the regulations stipulated by the EU Interest Directive have to be taken into consideration.
  3. Interest on Austrian bank deposits received by individuals resident in the European Union was subject to 35% EU WHT on the basis of the Austrian EU Withholding Tax Act. However, the EU Withholding Tax Act was abolished as of 1 January 2017 (for new bank accounts as of 1 October 2016). Subsequently, interest on Austrian bank deposits received by individuals resident in the European Union are no longer subject to WHT. The background of this law amendment is that Austria agreed on the automatic exchange of information (according to Directive 2014/107/EU).Interest (accrued) on Austrian bank deposits or Austrian bonds received by non-resident individuals, where the paying/depositary agent is located in Austria, is subject to 25% WHT (27.5% WHT for Austrian bonds).


## Tax treaties
The table below lists the countries that have signed a DTT with Austria and provides details of the amount of Austrian WHT for the most common payments of dividends and royalties/licences. Please refer to specific treaties to ensure the values are up-to-date and ensure you have considered the potential impact of the Multilateral Instrument (MLI).
Furthermore, please note that the following table reflects current values/WHT rates, and its accuracy concerning past events is limited. Please also be aware that the table below may serve as a preliminary guide by providing an initial overview. However, it is essential to refer to the respective DTT for any specific provisions or special conditions.
### Dividends
As mentioned above, the WHT rate stipulated under domestic law can be reduced if dividend distributions fall within the scope of a DTT. The applicable WHT rate varies depending on the jurisdictions involved and can be found in the respective DTT. 
Under certain treaties, the amount of the WHT depends on the extent of the proportion of the issued share capital held by the recipient. Therefore, dividend distributions from substantial holdings are often taxed at a lower rate than portfolio dividends. In order to qualify as a substantial holding, a certain minimum shareholding is required. The threshold deviates depending on the respective DTT and amounts to either 10% or 25% in most cases. The applicable threshold is shown in the table below. 
Dividend distributions attributable to a prior release of paid-in surplus or other shareholder contributions (classified as capital reserves) are deemed to be a repayment of capital, i.e. no WHT is incurred. At the shareholder's level, dividends received and those classified as contribution refund will reduce the tax basis assessment for investments. To the extent to which the tax basis would become negative, such dividends are treated as taxable capital gain (unless taxation is eliminated by a tax treaty).
### Royalties/licences
As mentioned above, the WHT rate stipulated under domestic law can be reduced if royalty payments fall within the scope of a DTT. Many DDTs provide for a complete exemption from WHT, while others reduce the WHT rate. In most cases, a rate of 5% or 10% is applied. While most treaties apply a uniform tax rate, some apply different tax rates depending on the specific source of the royalties. 
For royalty payments between affiliated companies, the regulations stipulated by the EU Interest Directive have to be taken into consideration. 
### Interest
Interest payments to non-resident corporations, under domestic tax law, are currently not subject to WHT. Therefore, they are not included in the table below.

On 10 October 2017, the Council of the European Union adopted new rules on tax dispute resolution (Directive [EU] 2017/1852). This Directive lays down rules for a mechanism to resolve disputes between member states arising from the interpretation and application of agreements on the elimination of double taxation. The Directive applies to complaints submitted after 30 June 2019 on questions relating to tax years from 2018 onwards. The EU Tax Dispute Resolution Act (‘EU-_Besteuerungsstreitbeilegungsgesetz_ ’ or EU-BStbG), implementing the EU directive into domestic law, entered into force on 1 September 2019.
