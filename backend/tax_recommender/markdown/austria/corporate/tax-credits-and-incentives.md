## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
## Foreign tax credit (matching credit)
Generally, foreign WHT can be credited against Austrian CIT (_see Foreign income in the section_). In special cases (e.g. Brazil, China, Korea), the DTT provides for a matching credit, which allows the credit of a pre-defined amount that exceeds the actually paid foreign WHT.
## Research and development (R&D) incentives
R&D costs are fully deductible at the time they accrue. An R&D premium of 14% (i.e. R&D expenses x 14% = R&D premium) may be claimed for R&D activities performed in Austria.
In order to receive the current R&D premium of 14%, an expert opinion issued by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) is required that confirms the nature of the expenses in question as R&D expenses. The definition of privileged R&D expenses is taken from the Frascati Manual.
The R&D premium is also available in case of subcontracted R&D; however, R&D incentives cannot be claimed by both principal and agent (the agent is just able to apply for the premium if the principal does not). In case of subcontracted R&D, the privileged R&D costs are capped at EUR 1 million per year.
Austria has no ‘patent box regime’.
