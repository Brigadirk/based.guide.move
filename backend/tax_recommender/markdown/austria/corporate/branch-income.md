## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 January 2025
Austrian branches of foreign corporations are taxed in the same way as Austrian corporations, except that inter-company dividends received by Austrian branches of non-EU corporations are not tax exempt (_see the section_) and Austrian tax losses can be carried forward only if they exceed non-Austrian profits. Books and records generally can be kept abroad but must be brought to Austria in case of a tax audit (upon official request).
