## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 13 August 2024
Income derived by a non-resident contractor for services in Papua New Guinea is usually subject to a WHT at the rate of 15% of gross income. The provisions extend to payments for the following:
  * The installation, maintenance, and use in Papua New Guinea of substantial equipment or machinery. 
  * Construction projects. 
  * For the lease or charter of any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or any machinery or vehicle. 
  * Consultancy or management services. 


Where the non-resident contractor rules do not apply, the non-resident company will be subject to income tax at the non-resident tax rate of 48% on its PNG-sourced taxable income (_see the section for a definition of taxable income_).
PNG branch remittances are not liable for dividend WHT or any branch profits or similar tax.
