## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 22 August 2024
Tax residents are subject to Vietnamese personal income tax (PIT) on their worldwide taxable income, wherever it is paid or received. Employment income is taxed on a progressive tax rates basis. Non-employment income is taxed at a variety of different rates.
Non-residents are subject to PIT at a flat tax rate on the income received as a result of working in Vietnam/on Vietnam-related income in the tax year, and at various other rates on their non-employment income. However, this will need to be considered in light of the provisions of any double taxation agreement (DTA) that might apply.

## Taxable period
The Vietnamese tax year is the calendar year. However, where in the calendar year of first arrival, an individual is present in Vietnam for less than 183 days, one's first tax year is the 12-month period from the date of arrival. Subsequently, the tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax codes
Individuals who have taxable income are required to obtain a tax code. Those who have taxable employment income must submit the tax registration file to their employer who will subsequently submit this to the local tax office. Those who have other items of taxable income are required to submit their tax registration file to the district tax office of the locality where they reside.
## Tax declarations and payment
For employment income, tax has to be declared and paid provisionally on a monthly/quarterly basis by the 20th day of the following month/the final day of the month following the reporting quarter, respectively. The amounts paid are reconciled to the total tax liability at the year-end. An annual final tax return must be submitted and any additional tax must be paid by the last day of the 3rd month of the following tax year for employer PIT returns and by the last day of the 4th month of the following tax year for individual PIT returns.
Expatriate employees are also required to carry out a PIT finalisation on termination of their Vietnam assignment upon their permanent departure. Tax refunds are only available to those who have a tax code.
For non-employment income, the individual is required to declare and pay PIT in relation to each type of taxable non-employment income. The PIT regulations require income to be declared and tax to be paid on a receipt basis.

SI contributions are payable by Vietnamese individuals with labour contracts and foreign individuals working in Vietnam holding a work permit and employed under a Vietnam labour contract with an indefinite term or a definite term of one year or more. Certain foreign employees internally transferred within a group and employees who have reached the statutory retirement age are not subject to compulsory SI contributions.
The SI contribution rates are as below:
Scheme | Employer rate (%) | Employee rate (%) | Effective date for foreigner  
---|---|---|---  
SI, including: | 17.5 | 8.0  
Sickness, maternity | 3.0 | 0.0 | 1 December 2018

Retirement and death | 14.0 | 8.0 | 1 January 2022  
Income subject to SI contributions includes salary, certain allowances, and other regular payments, but this is capped at 20 times the basic salary for SI contributions. 
Companies operating in industries with high risk of occupational diseases and accidents, meeting certain conditions, can apply for a lower employerâ€™s contribution rate for occupational diseases and accidents of 0.3% instead of the current regulated rate of 0.5% on salary subject to SI contribution (including both Vietnamese and foreign employees).
## Health insurance (HI) contributions
HI contributions are required for Vietnamese and foreign individuals that are employed under Vietnam labour contracts for at least three months.
HI contribution rates are 4.5% of the income subject to HI contribution, with 3% contributed by the employer and 1.5% by the employee.

UI contributions are applicable to Vietnamese individuals only.
The employer and employee contributions are 1% each on the income subject to UI contribution.
Income subject to UI contribution includes salary, certain allowances, and other regular payments, but this is capped at 20 times the minimum regional salaries. 
In March 2024, a draft of the amended version of the Law on Employment was released for public comments. The draft has proposed a change to the rate for UI contribution, i.e. up to 1%, rather than exactly 1% as currently.
