## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 22 August 2024
Tax residents are subject to Vietnamese personal income tax (PIT) on their worldwide taxable income, wherever it is paid or received. Employment income is taxed on a progressive tax rates basis. Non-employment income is taxed at a variety of different rates.
Non-residents are subject to PIT at a flat tax rate on the income received as a result of working in Vietnam/on Vietnam-related income in the tax year, and at various other rates on their non-employment income. However, this will need to be considered in light of the provisions of any double taxation agreement (DTA) that might apply.
