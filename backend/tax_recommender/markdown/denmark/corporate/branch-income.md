## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 04 February 2025
PEs of foreign companies are taxed under the same rules and rates as Danish resident companies. There is no branch remittance tax or other similar tax on repatriation of branch profits unless specific anti-avoidance rules apply. As a branch is considered to be the same legal entity as the headquarters, interest and other payments made from the branch to the foreign head office are seen as internal payments that are not tax deductible.
