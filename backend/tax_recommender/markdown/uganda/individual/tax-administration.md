## Tax returns
All taxpayers are obligated to file a return within six months of the end of the year of income. Where an individual is in business, one is expected to file the return accompanied by a statement of income and expenditure and a statement of assets and liabilities.
However, no return of income is required from a non-resident or resident individual where their income consists exclusively of income derived from a single employer from which tax has been withheld by the employer as required by the law.
A return is also not required for a non-resident individual whose tax obligation has fully been satisfied through the withholding of tax by withholding agents.
A return is also not required from a resident individual whose chargeable income falls in the zero rated threshold of tax.
## Payment of tax
Taxpayers receiving or expecting to receive income in a year of income that is not subject to any WHT at source are expected to pay provisional tax.
Individuals that are obligated to pay provisional tax as explained above are expected to pay four instalments of tax before the last day of the third month, sixth month, ninth month, and 12th month of the year of income. Each instalment is 25% of the individual's estimate of tax due for that year.
_As explained in the section_ , the provisional tax paid is granted as a tax credit against the income tax assessed at the end of the year of income. Excess tax paid can be refunded or offset against other liabilities.
