## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
VAT is charged on taxable supplies made by taxable persons, the importation of goods other than in cases of exempt imports, and imported services by any person. The standard VAT rate is 18%; some items are zero rated and others are exempt.
In cases of supplies of taxable products, the VAT is paid by the person making the supply. In cases of importation of goods, the VAT is paid by the importer. In cases of imported services, the VAT is paid by the person importing the services. If an individual falls in any of these categories one is expected to file a return with the revenue authority and remit the VAT to the authorities.
A taxable person is one who is registered for tax purposes; a person is required to register for VAT if, within any period of three calendar months, one made taxable supplies exceeding UGX 37,500,000. In such cases, the person should register within 20 days of the year end.
VAT returns are required to be filed on a monthly basis and are due on the 15th day following the month.

## Luxury and excise duties
Individuals pay excise duty on the purchase of goods subject to excise duty if, in the business of supplying such goods, they are also expected to account for the tax on the supplies made. _See the section of the Corporate tax summary for more information on goods subject to excise duties_.
