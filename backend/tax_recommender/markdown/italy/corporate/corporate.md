## Approval of several CIT provisions
The Legislative Decree 192/2024 (Revision of the Income Tax Regime – Individual Tax / Corporate Income Tax - CIT) introduced a number of different provisions on CIT matters. Below are the main measures:
  * **Reduction of book to tax differences**. 
    * **Capital account contributions** : elimination of the option to defer taxation. Effective date: contributions received in the fiscal year 2024;
    * **Short-term and long-term contracts and projects** : the accounting evaluation method adopted, namely "completed contract" or "percentage of completion," will also be relevant for tax purposes, provided it aligns with accounting principles.
    * **Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses** : exchange rate differences, for the FY 2024, will be immediately relevant for tax purposes, without the need to account deferred taxes including all the exchange rate differences noted at December 31, 2024.
  * **Regulation of book to book differences** : the income and asset components, arising from these differences, are fiscally relevant according to the applicable accounting principles, except when they are inconsistent with previous deduction and taxation rules applied. Possibility to realign the differences resulting from evaluations of assets and liabilities and from past variations, either using the global balance method, applying the standard CIT and regional tax rates (i.e. 24% + 3,9%), or individually, using substitute rates of CIT (18%) and Regional Production Tax (3%). Effective: FY 2024.
  * **Realignment of the higher values arising from extraordinary transactions** : possibility to realign the aforementioned higher values for M&A carried out from January 1, 2024 by paying a step up tax of 21% in a single payment (CIT 18% and Regional Production Tax 3%, replacing the previous rates of 12-14-16%) with reference to the year in which the operation was carried out.
  * **Tax Suspension Reserves Release** : it is possible to release tax suspension reserves existing in the financial statements as of December 31 2023, by paying a substitute tax of 10% in four equal annual installments.
  * **Tax Loss Carryforward (NOLs)** : different conditions and limits to tax loss carryforward have been introduced in case of change of control and change of actual business purposes. For intragroup transactions, the carryforward loss limits do not apply. Effective for: transactions implemented in the FY 2024. Transitional regime is applied for all the tax assets acquired up to the tax period ending on December 31, 2023.
  * **Demerger with spin-off (DWSO)** : the new tax regulation of the demerger pursuant to Article 2506.1 of the Italian Civil Code allows for a tax neutral regime, even in case of the demerger of individual assets, activities, or liabilities, and not only in case of such assets and liabilities were representing a going concern (business), like in the past.
  * **Contributions** : additional contributions of minority shares, distinct from the initial contribution that allowed the control, can benefit from the controlled realization regime (and thus achieve tax neutrality). It is also possible to create a “family-run” holding company with more than one shareholder, as well as making underperforming contributions. The deductibility of the related capital loss, equal to the difference between the increases in the capital of the transferee company and the recognized tax cost of the contributed share, is allowed. It is expressly provided that the goodwill value is included in the business contribution and, consequently, in the value of the share received by the contributor.
  * **Liquidation** : with the reform intervention, the result of each FY in ordinary liquidation will be determined definitively, no longer temporary.
  * **Regime of Italian shell companies** : the rates to be applied to the tax base of buildings, participations, and financial credits for calculating the presumed revenues have been halved, as well as the rates for calculating the minimum revenues whereas the operational test has not been passed.


The 2025 Budget Law introduced the following main Corporate Income Tax measures:
  * **Reduced CIT rate for companies reinvesting profits in qualified fixed assets** (so called “IRES Premiale”): reduction of the CIT rate from 24% to 20%, for the fiscal year 2025 only, for companies that respect certain conditions. Please refer to the specific section for more details.
  * **Additional deduction for labor costs** : this measure introduced by 2024 Budget Law only FY 2024 has been extended also for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2025, 2026, and 2027.
