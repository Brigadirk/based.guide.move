## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Taxable income is generally subject to progressive tax rates _(see the section for more information)_.
The Italian tax system provides the six following categories of income:
  * Employment income.
  * Business income.
  * Self-employment income.
  * Real estate income.
  * Investment income.
  * Capital gains.


The gross taxable income is determined by the sum of the taxable incomes of the above categories subject to ordinary taxation.
Please note that some kinds of income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) could be subject to a flat tax rate provided that conditions established by the Italian tax law are met.
## Employment income
Employment gross taxable income includes all compensation (cash or benefits in kind) received by the employee in relation to their employment relationship, including: bonuses, stock options, loans, overseas adjustments, cost of living allowance, tax reimbursements, car allowance, etc.As a general rule, 100% of compensation paid in cash is subject to tax (some exceptions to this rule are reported below), and compensation paid as fringe benefits (such as housing, loans, company car granted for personal and business use) are taxed on the base of the ‘normal value’ or on a lump-sum basis. Normal value is defined in Article 9 of the Italian Tax Code, as the price generally applied to similar goods and services on the market. In particular, for shares, bonds, and other securities listed on stock exchange or traded over-the-counter, the normal value shall be determined on the basis of the average closing price during the preceding month (30-31 days); for other shares, it is determined in proportion to the net equity value of the company.Specific rules apply to the items listed below.
### Out-of-town travel allowance
Travel allowances provided for transfers/business trips are included in taxable income on amounts exceeding EUR 46.48 per day (transfers within Italy), or EUR 77.47 per day (transfers outside of Italy), if no meal and no accommodation costs are reimbursed. The above amounts are reduced by:
  * 1/3 if meals or accommodation are reimbursed by the employer, or
  * 2/3 if both meals and accommodation are reimbursed by the employer.


If the employee does not receive any travel allowances, any expenses supported by receipts that are related to food, travel, and accommodation are not taxable in Italy. 
As a general rule the expenses need to be paid through traceable means (i.e. credit or debit cards, other electronic methods required by the law)
### Relocation allowance
A relocation allowance is taxed at 50% of the amount, for a sum that cannot exceed EUR 1,549.37 for transfers within Italian territory, and EUR 4,648.11 for foreign transfers. It should be noted, however, that such beneficial treatment is recognised only for the first year of transfer.
### Moving expenses
Moving expenses reimbursements (transportation of household goods, travelling expenses for employee and their family) are fully tax-free, if reimbursed by the employer upon submission of related receipts. The payments must be made with traceable means, such as bank transfers, credit or debit cards, or other electronic methods required by the law
### Employer contributions
Employer contributions to insured medical benefits are also considered taxable income in certain cases.
### Housing benefit
As a general rule accommodations provided to an employee by an employer are considered as a taxable benefit.
If the rental contract is in the name of the employer, and the rental fee is paid by the employer, the taxable amount is the difference between a figurative value called cadastral value (approximately equal to about 1/10 to 1/15 of the annual rental amount), increased by the utilities eventually reimbursed to the employee, and reduced by any contributions paid by the employee (if any).
If the rental contract is not in the name of the company, the taxable amount will be equal to the difference between the annual rental amount and the contributions paid by the employee (if any).
### Personal use of company car
The company car benefit (provided by the employer to the employee for private and business use) constitutes taxable income to the employee for an amount equal to the 30% of the imputable value determined in accordance with tables provided by the Italian Automobile Club (based on car model, engine power, fuel, and considering an average annual mileage of 15,000 km/_per annum_). This rule applies until 30 June 2020.
Starting from 1 July 2020, the Italian Budget Law 2020 has foreseen different percentages of the fringe benefit taxable depending on the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions emitted into the atmosphere, as follows:
  * 25% with the value of CO2 emitted less than 60 g/Km.
  * 30% with the value of CO2 emitted more than 60 g/Km and less than 160 g/Km.
  * 50% with the value of CO2 emitted more than 160 g/Km and less than 190 g/Km.
  * 60% with the value of CO2 emitted more than 190 g/Km.


Starting from January 1st 2025 the percentage of the imputable value is reduced to 10% for battery powered electric vehicles and to 20% for plug-in hybrid vehicles. For all other vehicles, except the two ones mentioned above, the imputable value is 50% of the amount corresponding to the conventional mileage of 15.000 kilometres.
### Interest on loans
The taxable income derived from loans granted by the employer, directly or through third parties, is equal to 50% of the difference between interest calculated at the official interest rate (in force at the end of each tax year concerned) and interest calculated at the rate applied by the employer or the third party.
Due to the increase of the official interest rate, the above provision, for the determination of the taxable value of the fringe benefits, has been amended by the Law Decree 145/2023 as follows:
  * For variable rate loans, the reference official interest rate is that in force on the due date of each instalment.
  * For fixed rate loans, the reference official interest rate is that on the date of granting of the loan.


### New tax regime for inbound workers
Individuals who transfer their tax residency (_see the_ _section for more information_) to Italy starting from tax period 2024 are subject to a reduction of 50% of the employment incomes earned on the Italian territory.
Article 5 of Legislative Decree 27 December 2023, no. 209, introduced significant changes to the ’inbound workers regime’.
In its current formulation, the tax benefit applies to employment incomes or equivalents and to self-employment incomes produced in Italy by the employees who transfer their tax residency pursuant to the new paragraph 2 of the Presidential Decree of 22 December 1986, no. 917.
Such incomes, within the limit of EUR 600,000 per year, do not contribute to the formation of the overall income to the extent of 50% of their amount.
The regime applies from the year of acquisition of the tax residence and for the four subsequent years.
The application of the new inbound workers regime is subject to compliance with the following conditions:
  * The employees undertake to reside for tax purposes in Italy for at least four tax periods.
  * The employees have not been tax residents in Italy in the three tax periods preceding their transfer.
  * However, if the employee carries out one’s work in Italy in favour of the same employer with whom one was employed abroad before the transfer or in favour of an employer belonging to the same group of companies, the minimum requirement of foreign residency is of: 
    * Six tax periods if the employee has not previously been employed in Italy for the same employer or for an employer belonging to the same corporate group.
    * Seven tax periods if the worker, before moving abroad, was employed in Italy for the same employer or for an employer belonging to the same corporate group.
  * The work activity, for the greater part of the tax period, is carried out in Italian territory.
  * The workers have high qualification or specialisation requirements as defined by the Legislative Decree. no. 108 of 28 June 2012 and by Legislative Decree no. 206 of 9 November 2007.


The contribution to the formation of the overall income is reduced to 40% in the event that the worker moves to Italy with a minor child or in case of the birth of a child during the period of use of the regime. In this latter case, the application of the greater benefit will start from the tax period in progress at the time of birth. In any case, it is required that, during the period of use of the regime, the minor child maintains residency in Italy.
The new provisions will apply to subjects who transfer their tax residency to Italy starting from the 2024 tax period.
Limited to individuals who transfer their legal residency to Italy in 2024, the application of the regime can be extended for another three years in the event that they become owners, by 31 December 2023 and, in any case, in the 12 months preceding the transfer in Italy, of a residential real estate used as a main residency in Italy. The non-contribution to the formation of the gross income, for the further three years, is equal to 50%.
Individuals who transferred their legal residency (i.e. who made the registration within the record of Italian resident population) by 31 December 2023 continue to apply the previous provisions regarding the application of the inbound workers regime.
### Employment activity performed abroad
Regarding the taxation of employment income derived from a work activity performed outside of Italy by a tax resident individual, the Italian tax law provides a specific rule which allows the individual to be subject to taxation on the ‘notional remuneration’ (_retribuzione convenzionale_). This particular tax regime is applicable when the following conditions are met:
  * The employee is a resident of Italy for tax purposes.
  * The employment activity is rendered wholly and continuously abroad for more than 183 days in a 12-month period.
  * The employee’s assignment abroad is regulated by a written agreement signed by the parties (the employee and the employer).


The ‘notional remuneration’ depends on the employee’s position (i.e. employee, manager) and the national labour contract applicable to the company (i.e. industrial/commercial activity).
Employment income derived from work activity performed abroad (outside of Italy) by a non-tax resident individual is not subject to taxation in Italy.
The Italian Budget Law for 2025 provided a new interpretation of the article of the law which governs the application of the _"retribuzioni convenzionali"._ In particular the condition that the employment activity is rendered wholly and continuously abroad for more than 183 days in a 12-month period is meet also assuming the employee return to his domicile in Italy one way per week.
### Equity compensation
The possibility of obtaining the benefit of an exemption from employment income taxation has been abolished by Law Decree number 112/2008 which entered in force on 25 June 2008. The taxation of stock options has been subject to different changes in law in the last few years; this latest Law Decree has established that, starting on 25 June 2008, income derived from the exercise of stock options (the difference between the ‘normal value’ of the shares at exercise date and the strike price) will be considered as taxable employment income and subject to ordinary progressive income tax rates. However, this income, as per the interpretation made by the Italian Social Security Authorities, is exempted from social security contributions.
## Self-employment income
Self-employment income is subject to IRPEF. The income derived from services rendered by self employees is calculated as the difference between fees collected and business expenses. Documented expenses refunded for travelling, boarding, and lodging expenses incurred in rendering services outside the tax domicile can be excluded from the formation of the taxable income.
Self-employment income can also be subject to VAT (_see Consumption taxes in the section_).
Self employees are required to keep accounting records, but directors and statutory auditors do not have to keep such records.
Non-residents who are self-employed are subject to a 30% final WHT unless otherwise provided by DTTs. In this case, they are not required to file an income tax return in case the WHT has been applied by an Italian withholding agent.
## Real estate income
Since FY 2013, the property used by the taxpayer as 'principal abode' is no longer subject to IMU (Real estate property tax)
### Principal abode
The taxable income deriving from the ownership of a principal abode is calculated on the basis of its 'cadastral value', which corresponds to the 'ordinary'/'average' income deemed to be derived from such properties, determined by the Cadastral Office in consideration of their characteristics. The cadastral value has to be increased by 5%.
In any case, the taxable value for principal abode can be deducted by the gross taxable income.
### Real estate at disposal
IMU has substituted IRPEF for real estate at disposal. The cadastral value, increased by 5%, of the real estates keep at disposal need to be reported on a tax return while no taxable income arises. However, an exception is provided for real estate at disposal located in the same municipality in which is located the principal abode, which constitutes taxable income in the measure of 50% of the cadastral value increased by 5%.
### Real estate rented
#### Taxed at a progressive tax rate
In case of rented real estate located in Italy, the taxable income generally corresponds to the highest amount between: (i) the cadastral income increased by 5% and (ii) 95% of the rental fees referring to the relevant tax period.
In fact, for leased buildings, the law admits a 5% flat rate reduction of rentals (higher flat rate reduction is provided in some specific cases) in consideration of eventual managing and maintenance expenses incurred by the owner.
As a result, related expenses actually incurred are not relevant for tax purposes.
The taxable income, as determined above, is subject to a progressive tax rate.
#### Taxed at a flat tax rate
As of FY 2011, a new tax regime, called _cedolare secca,_ has been introduced. It is a voluntary and optional tax regime which can replace the ordinary one. In case of application of the _cedolare secca_ , the rental income can be taxed at a fixed tax rate equal to 21% or 10%, provided some conditions are met.
This taxation replaces:
  * the incomes tax (national, regional, and municipal)
  * the registration tax
  * the stamp duty, and
  * other taxes.


The taxable base is 100% of the rental income.
### Foreign real estate
As of FY 2012, IVIE (_see the section for more information_) replaced the national income tax (IRPEF) on incomes deriving from foreign real estate not rented.
If the income deriving from the rented real estate owned outside of Italy is subject to rental income taxes in the foreign country, the same taxable base used in the foreign tax return is assumed as taxable base in Italy. This income is subject to taxation at progressive tax rates. In this case, the taxpayer is entitled to claim for the foreign tax credit in the Italian tax return in order to avoid double taxation.
The said deduction is limited to the proportion of the Italian tax corresponding to the ratio between the taxable income produced abroad (and subject to double taxation) and total income. The foreign tax credit cannot, in any case, exceed the net Italian tax due on the foreign source income.
Otherwise, if the income deriving from rented real estate owned outside of Italy is not subject to taxation in the foreign country, the rental income reduced by 15% constitutes the taxable income in Italy.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the section, which substitutes the income tax on foreign rental income deriving from a real estate owned out of Italy, provided the individual opted for it_.
## Investment income
Investment income is generally defined as income arising from the use of capital, typically interest and dividends.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the section, which substitutes the income tax on foreign interests and dividends, provided the individual opted for it_.
### Dividend income
The taxation of dividend distributions mainly depends on following categories of participation:
  * ‘Qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it exceeds 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market
    * it exceeds 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market.
  * ‘Non-qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it does not exceed 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of security traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market
    * it does not exceed 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign regulated public market.


Generally, dividend distributions deriving from a ‘qualified shareholding’ are subject to progressive tax rates on 49.72% of dividends distributed (i.e. 50.28% of dividends income is not subject to further taxation). Dividends distributions deriving from a ‘non-qualified shareholding’, such as dividends granted by Italian companies, are subject to final WHT at 26% to be applied at source, on the contrary through the annual Italian tax return.
Moreover, according to the 2018 Financial Law, as of FY 2018, the tax treatment of dividends deriving from qualified shareholdings will be aligned to the one provided for non-qualified shareholdings through the application of a 26% flat tax; a transition period has been provided where dividends distributed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022 and referred to profits produced before 31 December 2017 will be taxed according to the old provisions.
The 2018 Italian Budget Law has also introduced for Italian individuals without self-business a final WHT at a 26% rate for dividend distributions deriving from qualified and non-qualified shareholdings (starting from 1 January 2018).
With the answer to the tax ruling no. 454 of 22 September 2022, the Italian tax authorities confirmed the applicability of final WHT at a 26% rate for dividend income deriving from qualified shareholding received starting from 1 January 2023 regardless of the formation period.
The dividends distributed by a foreign entity that are not paid through an Italian resident intermediary shall be included (gross of foreign taxes withheld) in the individual tax return and taxed at a 26% flat rate.
Due to several sentences of the Supreme Court of Cassation, if provided by the Double tax treaty, the individual may have the possibility to ask for the reimbursement of foreign taxes withheld at source, within the measure provided by the applicable Tax Treaty,
Dividends distributed by a foreign entity and paid through an Italian resident broker are subject to tax at a 26% flat rate (net of foreign taxes withheld). In this case, no further action will be required.
### Interest income
Interests are subject to a flat tax rate of 26% to be applied at source.
## Capital gains
For individuals, capital gains are generally taxable, even if they do not arise from speculative intent or from a business.
_See the tax regime for neo-domiciled individuals in the section, which substitutes the income tax on capital gain, provided the individual opted for it_.
### Capital gains tax on securities
The taxable base referred to in the sale of assets (securities, i.e. stocks, bonds, etc.) is the sale price less the purchase price, with all the additional purchase costs (notary fees, taxes, broker fees, etc.).
As per the taxation of dividends, the taxation of capital gains on securities also mainly depends on the following categories of participation:
  * ‘Qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it exceeds 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market, or
    * it exceeds 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market
  * ‘Non-qualified shareholding’ if: 
    * it does not exceed 2% of the voting rights or 5% of the capital or of the equity in case of security traded in an Italian or foreign public regulated market, or
    * it does not exceed 20% of the voting rights or 25% of the capital or of the equity in case of securities not traded in an Italian or foreign regulated public market.


#### Qualified shareholdings
The capital gains earned by the sale of qualified shareholdings is taxed as follows:
  * Capital gains made before 31 December 2017: 49.72% of capital gains is included in the individual annual gross income (income taxed applying progressive tax rates).
  * Capital gains made between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018: 58.14% of capital gains is included in the individual annual gross (income taxed applying progressive tax rates).
  * Capital gains made as of January 2019 will be taxed applying a flat tax rate of 26% on the whole capital gains amount. The 2018 Italian Financial Bill introduced a final WHT at 26% both to tax resident and non-tax resident individuals for capital gains deriving from a qualified and a non-qualified shareholding (starting from 1 January 2019).


#### Non-qualified shareholdings
The capital gains earned by the sale of non-qualified shareholdings is taxed applying a flat tax rate of 26%.
### Capital gains tax on the sale of a real estate
The taxable base of the real estate capital gains is the difference between the sale price and the original cost of real estate together with the sum of all the additional purchase costs (notary fees, taxes, etc.).
The capital gain on the sale of real estate is taxed at progressive tax rates or with a flat tax of 26% under certain conditions. 
There are some exemptions, however, and such are applicable on capital gains deriving from the following sales:
  * The sale of a real estate if owned for more than five years.
  * The sale of a real estate, even if owned for less than five years, if it has been used as primary residence for most of the period of ownership (even if owned for less than five years).


## Exempt income
The following are some examples of income exempt from IRPEF:
  * War pensions.
  * Pensions and allowances paid to legally blind, deaf-mute, and invalid individuals.
  * Social pension.
  * Revenues paid by the National Institute for the Insurance against on-the-job injuries (called INAIL) for permanent disability or for death.
