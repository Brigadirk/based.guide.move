In Gabon, the family status, including number of dependent children, is used to form the basis for the IRPP brackets. _See the section for more information_.
## Business deductions
Individuals may take a standard 20% deduction (limited to XAF 10 million) on their gross income for business-related expenses, such as travel fees, representation costs, and business materials. The deduction is applied to the adjusted gross income, derived by first calculating the CNSS, the CNAMGS, and TCTS.
