## Employment income
The IRPP is calculated on the net global revenue earned by the taxpayer during the course of a calendar year (1 January until 31 December).
The net global revenue is equivalent to the total net revenue of the following types of incomes:
  * Land income.
  * Industrial, commercial, and craft profits.
  * Agricultural returns.
  * Non-commercial profits.
  * Salaries.
  * Stock and shares profits.


The IRPP is due by the head of the family for one’s own revenues, those of one’s spouse, and of one’s dependent children.
Regarding salaries, the taxable income includes all cash remuneration, allowances, acquisition gain related to the allocation to employees of free shares on preferential basis, and bonuses paid to employees. However, some bonuses listed in the Gabonese General Tax Code are exempted from the tax, provided they do not exceed the ceiling of XAF 4 million per year.

  * Housing (free accommodation): 15% of the basic net salary.
  * Housing allowance.
  * Electricity and water: 5% of the basic net salary.
  * Domesticity: 5% of the basic net salary.
  * Food: 25% of the basic net salary, up to a limit of XAF 120,000 per person and per month.
