## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 25 April 2024
## Domestic dividend tax
The tax rate for the dividend distribution between Romanian legal entities is 8%. The dividend tax is eliminated if there is a shareholding percentage of a minimum of 10% for an uninterrupted period of at least one year.
## WHT for non-residents
All income obtained by non-residents from Romanian taxpayers for the provision of services rendered in Romania or for management and consultancy services (irrespective of the rendering place) are subject to 16% WHT in Romania.
Non-resident companies not operating through a PE are subject to a 16% WHT on revenue sourced in Romania, such as interest, royalties, revenue from services (_as mentioned above_), commissions, and revenue derived from liquidation of a Romanian legal entity.
The tax rate for dividend revenues derived by non-residents from Romania is 8%.
Certain specific provisions and exceptions apply to non-resident WHT, as follows:
  * A 50% WHT applies to payments made by Romanian residents (e.g. interest, royalties, commissions, services) to non-residents in countries that do not have an exchange of information agreement concluded with Romania. This WHT is applicable only to the extent such payments result from artificial transactions.
  * As Romania is an EU member state, the provisions of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive apply. Consequently, dividends paid by Romanian companies to companies resident in one of the EU member states are exempt from WHT if the dividend beneficiary has held, at the time of distribution, a minimum of 10% of the shares of the Romanian company for an uninterrupted period of at least one year. This rule is applicable also to EEA state members (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway).
  * Dividend and interest income obtained from Romania by EU/EEA-registered pension funds is exempt from WHT if the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive conditions are met.
  * Romania has implemented the Interest and Royalties Directive. Payments of interest and royalties made by a Romanian company to another company resident in an EU member state are tax exempt from WHT if the non-resident company held, for an uninterrupted period of at least two years, at least 25% of the share capital of the Romanian company prior to the time of payment.


In order to apply EU legislation, non-resident recipients of the income are required to present a certificate of tax residence and a declaration attesting the compliance with the necessary requirements provided by the European Directives.
The Romanian Fiscal Code incorporates the amendments to the European Parent-Subsidiary Directive no. 2011/96/EU. The legislation introduces the anti-abuse rule for preventing unlawful tax practices used to obtain tax benefits contrary to the Directive’s principles. Also, dividends received by a Romanian legal entity from a foreign legal entity under certain conditions will not be taxed as long as those dividends are not treated as deductible expenses by the paying subsidiary.
The following categories of income derived by non-residents from Romania are exempt from WHT:
  * Interest income and income derived from the sale of debt instruments issued by the Romanian authorities (e.g. government bonds).
  * Revenue from international transportation and accessory services.
  * Prizes obtained by individual non-residents from artistic, cultural, or sport festivals/competitions paid from public funds.
  * Income obtained from a partnership constituted in Romania by a non-resident company (the related profits are subject to CIT).


Legal entities/individuals resident in member states of the European Union or the Economic European Area deriving interest revenues and/or revenues from freelancing activities in Romania may opt for the regularisation of the WHT by way of declaring and paying in Romania the CIT/PIT related to the revenues obtained.
The tax withheld and paid is deemed as an advance payment in connection with the CIT/PIT.
The possibility for regularisation of the WHT is only applied in the case of revenues derived from Romania by residents of member states of the European Union or the European Economic Area, provided that a Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation or a legal instrument for the exchange of information is concluded between Romania and those states.
