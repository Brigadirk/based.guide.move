  * Expenses reflected in accounting records, irrespective of their nature, that later prove to be related to acts of corruption as defined under the law.


Note that credit institutions apply IFRS rules, and certain non-deductibility rules are provided for this category of taxpayers.
## Depreciation
Romanian law makes an explicit distinction between fiscal and accounting depreciation. Fiscal depreciation is treated as a deductible element within the CIT computation, while accounting depreciation should be treated as a non-deductible expense. Companies should maintain a separate record to reflect the separate computation of the fiscal and accounting depreciation. Any accounting revaluations of fixed assets are not taken into account in computing the tax depreciation.
Assets are generally depreciated using the straight-line method. However, accelerated or reducing balance depreciation methods may be used to determine fiscal depreciation for certain assets, while the accounting depreciation method may be different.
The useful lives to be used for tax purposes are the ones stated in the Official Fixed Assets Catalogue, published under government decision. Ranges are provided for classes of fixed assets, from which the taxpayers can choose the useful life (e.g. office and housing buildings: 40 to 60 years, commercial buildings: 32 to 48 years, commercial furnishings: 9 to 15 years, automobiles: 4 to 6 years).
For vehicles with up to nine seats, the fiscal depreciation is limited to a maximum of RON 1,500 per month for each vehicle. Certain categories of vehicles are exempt from this monthly deduction limitation (e.g. used exclusively for emergency, security, or delivery service; used for paid passenger transport; or used for paid supply of services).
Land cannot be depreciated for tax purposes.
### Accelerated depreciation
Under the Romanian Fiscal Code, machinery and technical equipment, computers and their peripherals, as well as patents, may be depreciated by using the accelerated method, under which a maximum of 50% of the asset’s fiscal value may be deducted during the first year of usage, while the rest of the asset’s value can be depreciated using the straight-line method over the remaining useful life.
## Goodwill
As a rule, goodwill is deemed non-depreciable from a Romanian fiscal perspective.
## Start-up expenses
Start-up expenses recognised as intangible assets according to the applicable accounting regulations can be depreciated over a maximum period of five years.
## Provisions and reserves
As a general rule, provisions and reserves are non-deductible for CIT purposes. However, there are certain provisions and reserves that are deductible, such as:
  * Setting up or increasing the legal reserve fund up to 5% of the accounting profit, adjusted with CIT expense, and until it reaches 20% of the share capital.
  * Provisions related to guarantees for proper execution granted to the clients.
  * Provisions for depreciation of specific receivables are deductible at up to 30% if the related receivables meet the following conditions simultaneously: 
    * Not collected for a period exceeding 270 days from the due date.
    * Not guaranteed by another person.
    * Due by a person not affiliated with the taxpayer.
  * Bad debt provisions are fully deductible if all the following conditions are met: 
    * The debtor is a company for which the court declared the opening bankruptcy procedure or an individual for whom insolvency procedure has been declared open based on: 
      * Reimbursement plan.
      * Asset liquidation.
      * Simplified procedure.
    * Receivables are not guaranteed by another person.
    * The debtor is not a related party.
  * Specific provisions established by non-banking financial institutions and other legal persons according to their incorporation law.
  * Adjustments for impairment set up by credit institutions that apply IFRS and prudential filters set up according to regulations issued by the National Bank of Romania.
  * Technical reserves set up by insurance and reinsurance companies, in accordance with their regulatory legal framework, except for the equalisation reserve.
  * Risk provisions for transactions carried out on financial markets, in accordance with the rules issued by the Romanian National Securities Commission.
  * Provisions and adjustments for impairment of receivables that were acquired by legal persons from credit institutions in order to be collected, for the difference between the receivables value and the amount due to the assignee, provided several conditions are met.
  * Reserves from revaluation of fixed assets and land made after 1 January 2004, which are deductible through depreciation or through expenses triggered by assets sold or written off, are taxable at the same time and for the same amount as the tax depreciation/write-off deduction (i.e. when the assets are sold or written off).
  * In case the level of the subscribed share capital was reduced, the part of the legal reserve corresponding to the reduction that was previously deducted represents an element similar to revenues.


The reduction or cancellation of any provision or reserve deducted from the taxable profit, due to changing the destination of the provision or reserve, distribution towards shareholders in any form, liquidation, spin-off, merger, or any other reason, should be included in the taxable revenue and taxed accordingly.
Note that special rules are applicable to credit institutions that are required to apply IFRS rules.
## Fiscal losses
Starting from 2024, companies are allowed to carry forward fiscal losses declared in the annual CIT returns for a period of up to five years, within 70% of the taxable profits threshold, based on the FIFO method. No related adjustment for inflation is allowed.
Any loss incurred by a PE of a Romanian company located in a non-EU/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member state or in a country that has a DTT in place with Romania is only deductible for tax purposes from the revenue derived by that PE, and losses can be carried forward only for a period of five years.
For foreign legal persons, carryforward of losses applies only to revenue and expenses attributable to their PE in Romania.
Losses incurred by a company can be transferred within a merger/spin-off operation and can be recovered by the successors, in proportion to the assets and liabilities transferred. The successors of these restructuring operations are able to use such losses during the remaining period.
Carryback of losses is not available in Romania.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
Transactions with Romanian-affiliated companies and with non-resident related parties fall within the scope of the investigations regarding compliance with transfer pricing legislation (_see Transfer pricing in the_ _section_).
