## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 20 December 2024
New Zealand resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income, and non-resident companies (including branches) are taxed on their New Zealand-sourced income, subject to any applicable DTA.
The New Zealand corporate income tax (CIT) rate is 28%.
## Implementation of the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules - Global Minimum Tax
New Zealand has enacted legislation to implement the GloBE Rules, a key component of the OECDâ€™s Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax challenges of digitalisation of the economy. The legislation includes the following:
  * The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), which applies for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. This rule applies to New Zealand headquartered multinationals and New Zealand entities that are subsidiaries of a foreign-headquartered multinational located in a jurisdiction that has not implemented this rule (where the New Zealand subsidiary has subsidiaries outside of New Zealand).
  * The Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), which applies from 1 January 2025. Where no IIR applies, the UTPR will apply to foreign multinationals that operate in New Zealand.
  * The Domestic Income Inclusion Rule (DIIR), which applies to New Zealand headquartered multinational groups only from 1 January 2026. 


These rules will impact large multinationals with annual global revenue of 750 million euros (EUR) or more, subject to certain exemptions.
## Local income taxes
There are no state or municipal income taxes in New Zealand.
