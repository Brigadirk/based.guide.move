## Value-added tax (VAT)
The VAT rate is 20%, and the VAT rate on export is 0%. VAT input is recoverable under certain conditions.
The VAT rate of 10% is applicable for locally produced butane gas. 
VAT is applicable to all transactions related to any services performed in Madagascar by a corporate entity with turnover equal to or more than MGA 400 million.
Services are considered to be performed in Madagascar if such services are executed in Madagascar, used in Madagascar, or invoiced to a taxpayer established in Madagascar.
There is no VAT registration threshold for a non-resident supplier. A foreign company that has no PE in Madagascar but renders services to a Madagascar taxpayer is taxable to VAT. The foreign company should appoint a tax representative to collect and pay VAT on its behalf. In the absence of such tax representative, the recipient or business consumer in Madagascar is liable to account for VAT on the services.
VAT is generally chargeable on:
  * supplies of goods and services made in Madagascar by a taxpayer in the course of its business
  * importation of goods and certain services into Madagascar, and
  * execution of building and civil works.


In the absence of information to the contrary, prices are deemed to be inclusive of VAT. Supplier invoices should mention clearly the amount of VAT in order to allow the recipient to deduct VAT input tax. Any payment between two VAT payers must be executed by way of bank transaction (e.g. bank cheque, bank card, mobile banking).
VAT collected by the supplier can be credited against VAT output. If output tax is not sufficient to offset input tax, then the difference constitutes a VAT credit. A VAT credit can be carried forward on the following monthly deadlines.
Only free zone companies, export professionals, approved credit-lessors, and companies subject to VAT making investments can claim for VAT refund. VAT refund is extended to VAT paid by oil and gas entities on their importation of services under certain conditions.

## Registration fees
Registration fees are applicable to transfers of title ownership (e.g. sales, donations) of movable and immovable assets, to transfers of interests, to share capital increases, and to lease agreements.
Registration fee rates are 0.5% to 5%, depending on the nature of the transaction. The rate of 5% is applicable mainly on transfers of assets and transfers of business. In the event of the existence of a suspensive condition, it is required to inform the competent tax office of the fulfillment of this condition within two months of its date. 
A registration fee of 0.5% of share capital is applicable to registration of a new company. 
In the event of an extension of the life of the company, a registration fee of 0.5% is calculated on the basis of the net assets shown in the balance sheet at the end of the financial year preceding the decision to extend.
