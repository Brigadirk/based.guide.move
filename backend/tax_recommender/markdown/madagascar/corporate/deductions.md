## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 17 September 2024
## Depreciation
The amount of deductible depreciation should not exceed the amount that is calculated according to the following rates of depreciation provided by the law:
Asset | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Industrial buildings | 5  
Plant and machinery | 10  
Mining exploration and development (licence) | 33  
Transportation (car) | 20  
Transportation (utility cars, vans, trucks) | 25  
Computers | 25  
Electricity generators | 10  
With the exception of buildings, it is also possible to practise a graduated depreciation. In this case, the annual depreciation corresponds to 30% of the net book value of the asset.
In case of loss, depreciation of assets can be deferred and carried forward to the next financial years until absorption.
## Goodwill
There is no provision concerning deductibility of goodwill in the Madagascar tax code.
## Start-up expenses
There is no specific tax provision on start-up expenses. Accounting rules are applicable for the profit and loss recognition.
Start-up and prospecting expenses for the installation of an overseas establishment, as well as the costs of running such a foreign establishment, for the first three years are tax deductible. However, the amounts deducted must be reported, in equal amounts, to the taxable income of the five consecutive years from the fifth year following the creation of the foreign establishment.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are deductible. However, interest on inter-company loans between companies within the same group is subject to thin capitalisation rules (_see Thin capitalisation in the_ _section for more information_). In addition, interest on inter-company loans and interest on intra-group cash advances are not deductible if the arrangement is not documented by a written agreement, ratified by the general meeting of shareholders and submitted according to registration procedures.
## Bad debt
To be tax-deductible, provisions for doubtful debt must be subject to justification of existence of amicable or judicial settlement. The claims must be individualised.
