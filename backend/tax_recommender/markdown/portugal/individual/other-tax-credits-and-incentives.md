## Non-habitual residents (NHR) regime
The NHR regime was revoked with effect from 1 January 2024 onward. However, the regime is still applicable to those who (i) are already registered as NHR on 1 January 2024 or (ii) by 31 December 2023 meet the conditions for registration as NHR. 
The regime is also applicable to individuals who became tax residents until 31 December 2024, provided certain conditions were met. 
### Conditions, taxation, and other specificities 
A taxpayer who became tax resident in Portugal for a certain year and has not been taxed as resident in Portugal for any of the previous five years are eligible for the special tax regime for non-habitual tax residents (additional conditions imposed by law apply for those who became tax residents in 2024 in order for them to be entitled to the special regime).
An application for the non-habitual residents tax regime has to be submitted electronically by 31 March, inclusive, of the year following the year in which the taxpayer became tax resident in Portugal (those who became tax residents in 2024 and are eligible for the regime under the special conditions imposed by law have until 31 March 2025 to submit the application).
In general terms, non-habitual residents are taxed at a flat rate of 20% in respect of employment income (Category A) and self-employment income (Category B) arising from high-value activities of a scientific, artistic, or technical nature.
A tax exemption (with progression, depending on the category of income) applies on foreign-source income (e.g. property income, interest, and dividends), provided certain conditions are met. In most cases, capital gains on the sale of securities are taxable at a flat rate of 28%. In addition, a flat tax rate of 10% is applicable on pensions from a foreign source, as well as to other payments from pension funds and similar retirement schemes.
A non-habitual resident acquires the right to be taxed as such during a ten-year period.
## Tax Incentive Scheme for Scientific Research and Innovation (IFICI) 
With the 2024 State Budget, a tax incentive for research and innovation is created. 
The regime applies to individuals who (i) become Portuguese tax residents, under Portuguese domestic law, in a specific year, (ii) have not qualified as tax residents in Portugal in any of the previous five years, (iii) do not benefit or have benefited from the NHR regime or the former resident regime, and (iv) who carry out activities provided for in the applicable legislation. 
Different procedures should be enacted in order to apply for the regime, depending on the activity performed / on the criteria of eligibility. 
In general terms, the regime shall provide for: 
  * A special 20% rate on net employment income (category A) and business and professional income (category B) from the activities identified in the applicable legislation. 


  * An exemption on foreign-sourced employment income, business and professional income, investment income, rental income and capital gains (as a rule, foreign-sourced income is exempt with the exception of pension income and income sourced in “blacklisted” countries).


## Youth Personal Income Tax ("_IRS_ _Jovem_ ")
With the 2025 State Budget, the Youth Personal Income Tax (PIT) tax regime is extended, making it applicable to income from employment and self-employed work earned by taxpayers (not dependents) who are up to 35 years old, while also eliminating the condition related to the completion of a cycle of studies.
In summary and in accordance with the current regime, income from Category A (employment income) and Category B (self-employment/business income) earned by taxpayers who are up to 35 years old who are not dependents is partially exempt from PIT in the first ten years earning employment or self-employment income.
The exemption applicable corresponds to 100% of the income earned in the first year, 75% in the second, third and fourth years, 50% in the fifth, sixth and seventh years and 25% in the eighth, ninth and tenth years, capped at 55x Social Support Index (IAS).
A transitional regime has been created which establishes that, for purposes of exemption, taxpayers are included in the percentage corresponding to the year following the number of years of income generation from categories A and B already elapsed, not considering, for this purpose, the years in which they were considered dependents.
The exemption does not apply in the years in which income from categories A and B is not earned, resuming its application for the remaining years income is obtained by the taxpayer, until a total of ten years of exemption or the age limit of 35 years is reached.
