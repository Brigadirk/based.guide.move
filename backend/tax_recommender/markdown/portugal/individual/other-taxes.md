## Social security contributions
### Employees
Social security contributions are shared by the employee and the employer. In general terms, the contributions are due on the employeeâ€™s gross remuneration at rates of 11% and 23.75% by the employee and the employer, respectively. These contributions cover family, pension, and unemployment benefits.
In addition to social security contributions at a general rate of 23.75%, employers must buy an insurance premium to cover occupational accidents. The premium varies according to work and risk classification.
### Members of the board
Regarding members of the board, the social security rates correspond to 9.3% with respect to the individual contributions and 20.3% for employer contributions. However, the contribution rate applicable to members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators is set at rates of 23.75% and 11% to employers and members of statutory boards, respectively. The contributions of members of statutory boards are based on their effective remuneration but subject to a monthly minimum income level of EUR 522.50.
Members of statutory boards who are considered as managers or administrators, and some types of self-employees, become entitled to protection in the event of unemployment.
### Self-employees
The contributions rate applicable to self-employees corresponds to 21.4%. For self-employees under the simplified tax regime, the monthly contribution basis corresponds to 1/3 of the relevant remuneration determined in each reporting period and produces effects in that month and in the following two months. For the determination of the relevant remuneration of the self-employee, it is considered the income received in the three months previously to the reporting month. The relevant remuneration corresponds to 70% of the income from services rendered and to 20% of the income related to the production and sales of products. 
The basis of contributions considered in each month has a limit of 12 times the IAS.
A 10% contribution rate is due by employers if 80% or more of the fees earned by the self-employee come from services for the same company, for the same person with a business activity, or to the same group. A 7% contribution rate is due by employers when the economic dependence of the self-employee varies between 50% and 80%. The contribution is payable upon the issue of a tax assessment by the social security authorities.
In 2025, the Portuguese monthly minimum wage is EUR 870.
