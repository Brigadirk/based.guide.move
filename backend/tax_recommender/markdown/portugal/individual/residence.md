## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 20 February 2025
According to the Portuguese tax law in force since January 2015, an individual is deemed to be resident in Portugal for tax purposes if one meets either of the following conditions:
  * Spends more than 183 days, consecutive or not, in Portugal in any 12-month period starting or ending in the fiscal year concerned.
  * Regardless of spending less than 183 days in Portugal, maintains a residence (i.e. a habitual residence) in Portugal during any day of the period referred above, with the intention to use it and keep it as oneâ€™s primary residence.


As a rule, the taxpayer will become resident in Portugal as of the first day of stay in the Portuguese territory and non-tax resident as of the last day of stay in Portugal, with a few exceptions.
