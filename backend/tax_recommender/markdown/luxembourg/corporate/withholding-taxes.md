Notes
These notes are not extensive. The full text of the DTT should be checked for a comprehensive view on the conditions of application of reduced rates.
  1. Under Luxembourg domestic law, no WHT is levied on dividends paid by a Luxembourg qualifying subsidiary to an entity that is: 
    1. a collective entity falling within the scope of the Parent Subsidiary Directive
    2. a Luxembourg resident joint-stock company, which is fully taxable and does not take one of the forms listed in the LITL
    3. a PE of a collective entity falling under the previous categories
    4. a collective entity that is resident in a country with which Luxembourg has concluded a DTT and is fully liable to a tax corresponding to the Luxembourg CIT, or a domestic PE of such an entity
    5. a Swiss resident joint-stock company that is subject to Swiss CIT without benefiting from any exemption
    6. a joint-stock company or a cooperative company that is resident in an EEA member state (other than an EU member state) and is fully liable to a tax corresponding to the Luxembourg CIT, or
    7. a PE of a joint-stock company or of a cooperative company that is resident in an EEA member state (other than an EU member state), and
    8. at the date on which the income is made available, the beneficiary has been holding or undertakes to hold, directly, for an uninterrupted period of at least 12 months, a participation of at least 10%, or with an acquisition price of at least EUR 1.2 million in the share capital of the income debtor.
Qualifying shareholders under (b) to (g) above need to be fully taxable collective entities subject in their country of residence to a tax similar to that imposed by Luxembourg. As a general rule, this requirement is met if the foreign tax is compulsorily levied at an effective rate of at least 8% (as from tax year 2025, previously 8.5%), on a basis similar to the Luxembourg one.
Provisions effective from 1 January 2016, amending the participation exemption regime, transpose effectively verbatim into Luxembourg law the 'anti-hybrid instrument' and 'common minimum anti-avoidance rule' (EU PSD GAAR) measures amending the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive (PSD), adopted in July 2014 and January 2015, respectively.
EU PSD GAAR: The withholding tax exemption no longer applies to dividends distributed by a Luxembourg resident joint-stock company to a joint stock company resident in another member state or a permanent establishment located in another member state of a joint stock company resident in another member state (which would otherwise qualify for the participation exemption) if the dividend is distributed as part of an arrangement or a series of arrangements that, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the PSD, are not genuine having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances.
An arrangement may comprise more than one step or part. For the purposes of the GAAR, an arrangement or a series of arrangements shall be regarded as not genuine to the extent that they are not put into place for valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality. It is therefore increasingly important to continually monitor the substance and activities of entities in a structure.
  2. Interest paid to non-residents generally is not subject to WHT in Luxembourg. However, interest that represents a right to profit participation on a bond may be assimilated to a dividend and subject to WHT. Further analysis should be made to determine the applicable reduced rate on the basis of the treaty (i.e. pursuant to dividend or interest clause).
  3. Royalties paid to non-residents are not subject to WHT in Luxembourg, whether the companies are associated or not.
  4. A WHT of 20% is withheld on defined interest income paid by a Luxembourg paying agent to resident individuals. Interest indirectly cashed through investment funds are out of the scope of this WHT.
  5. DTTs have been signed with Albania, Argentina, Cape Verde, Colombia, Ghana, Kuwait, Montenegro and Oman, but these DTTs are not yet in force. DTT with Kyrgyzstan has not been signed yet.
