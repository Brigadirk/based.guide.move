## New framework agreement on social security position of cross-border teleworkers in the European Union
An EU framework agreement on the determination of the applicable social security scheme for certain cross-borders teleworkers within the European Union was published in June 2023. This framework agreement aims to introduce a more permanent arrangement to determine the social security position of cross-border teleworkers in the European Union as of 1 July 2023. More specifically, the framework agreement provides for a system (on the basis of article 16 of Regulation (EC) no. 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems) whereby, when adopted by the member states involved, teleworking in an employeeâ€™s residence state will, if a number of conditions are met, not be taken into account for the determination of the applicable social security scheme if it accounts for less than 50% of their working time.
The principles of the framework agreement only apply when the member states involved in a given situation have both signed the agreement.
