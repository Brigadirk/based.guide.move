## New framework agreement on social security position of cross-border teleworkers in the European Union
An EU framework agreement on the determination of the applicable social security scheme for certain cross-borders teleworkers within the European Union was published in June 2023. This framework agreement aims to introduce a more permanent arrangement to determine the social security position of cross-border teleworkers in the European Union as of 1 July 2023. More specifically, the framework agreement provides for a system (on the basis of article 16 of Regulation (EC) no. 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems) whereby, when adopted by the member states involved, teleworking in an employee’s residence state will, if a number of conditions are met, not be taken into account for the determination of the applicable social security scheme if it accounts for less than 50% of their working time.
The principles of the framework agreement only apply when the member states involved in a given situation have both signed the agreement.

## New tax measures as of 2024
The Luxembourg Parliament voted on 11 December 2024 to approve bill 8414 amending the Luxembourg tax legislation. The bill introduces several important measures for both individual and corporate taxpayers and aim to strengthen the purchasing power of Luxembourg residents and cross-border employees and the competitiveness of Luxembourg companies
The main measures for individuals are the following:
  * Revamp of the impatriate tax regime
  * New tax exemption for bonuses paid to employees under 30 years old;
  * Revised ceilings for the profit sharing scheme;
  * New adjustment of the tax scale to counter the indexation of salaries to inflation;
  * More advantageous tax calculation formula for single parents, widows, and citizens over 64 years old;
  * Increased single parent tax credit;
  * Increased Minimum Social Wage Tax credit;
  * Increased deduction for extraordinary expenses for dependents outside the household;
  * Unskilled minimum social wage exempt from tax in all tax classes:
  * Tax credit for overtime hours for cross-border workers.


These measures are designed to enhance Luxembourg's competitiveness and encourage the creation of high-value-added jobs. The anticipated tax revenue loss from these measures is expected to be balanced by increased tax revenues in the medium term.
Additionally, considering the continuous tension in relation to the Luxembourgish real estate, notably due to the high long-term interest rates that affect the borrowing capacity of households, the Law dated 22 May 2024 introduced new temporary measures in order to boost the housing market. These temporary measures were initially taken only for the tax year 2024. However, the following measures have been extended for an additional period of 6 months, i.e., until 1 July 2025.
These temporary measures are summarised below:
  * Creation of a temporary tax credit (_crédit d'impôt location_) on registration and transcription fees of 20,000 euros (EUR) maximum per individual investor (EUR 40,000 per couple investor) under specific conditions for all property acquisitions intended for rent.
  * The current tax credit (_Bëllegen Akt_) providing an allowance on registration and transcription fees of EUR 30,000 per individual purchaser (EUR 60,000 per couple purchaser) is increased to EUR 40,000 per individual purchaser (EUR 80,000 per couple purchaser) for the acquisition of a main residence in Luxembourg.
  * _Abattement construction special_ : Individual taxpayers who signed a deed 'VEFA' (i.e. off-plan purchase) between 1 January and 31 December 2024 for buildings intended for rent can benefit from an accelerated depreciation rate of 6% per year for the first six years following the building completion.
  * Capital gains resulting from the sale of immovable property making part of the private wealth of the individual taxpayer will be subject to taxation at 1/4 of the marginal tax rate.
  * Capital gains realised in 2024 by the individual taxpayer on the sale of building making part of the private wealth more than two years after their acquisition could be tax immunised upon request in case of total or partial reinvestment of the sale price.


### Adjustments to personal income tax (PIT) brackets
For employees, the PIT brackets have been adjusted by an equivalent of four index tranches as of 2024, leading to a reduction of PIT as of 1 January 2024 (_see the section_).


# Luxembourg
## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
Individual income tax is levied on the worldwide income of individuals residing in Luxembourg, as well as on Luxembourg-source income of non-residents.
## Personal income tax rates
Luxembourg income tax liability is based on the individual's personal situation (e.g. family status). For this purpose, individuals are granted a tax class. Three tax classes have been defined:
  * Class 1 for single persons.
  * Class 2 for married persons as well as civil partners (under certain conditions).
  * Class 1a for single persons with children as well as single taxpayers aged at least 65 on 1 January of the tax year.


Since 1 January 2018, married non-resident taxpayers who are not separated are granted tax class 1. However, subject to some conditions, they can request to be treated as Luxembourg tax resident to obtain the application of the tax class 2 (generally, the tax class for resident unseparated spouses). The application of tax class 2 leads to a combined assessment.
Non-resident taxpayers may request joint taxation under tax class 2 (i.e. as for married resident taxpayers), provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
  * 90% of the worldwide income of one spouse is taxable in Luxembourg. When assessing whether this is the case, the first 50 days that are not taxable in Luxembourg according to a double tax treaty (DTT) are fictively treated as income taxable in Luxembourg.
  * The income of one taxpayer taxable outside Luxembourg does not exceed EUR 13,000.
  * For Belgian residents, the rules are less restrictive. Only 50% of the household’s professional income need to be taxable in Luxembourg.


This option can be requested via either payroll or individual tax return. Non-resident married taxpayers will have to report their non-Luxembourg-sourced income (for example, the spouse’s professional income). In principle, non-Luxembourg-sourced income will be exempted for Luxembourg tax purposes but will be taken into account when determining the applicable tax rate for the Luxembourg-sourced income ('exemption with progression').
In practice, married non-resident taxpayers where one spouse works outside of Luxembourg and/or where the individual has extensive income outside of their Luxembourg employment income will be adversely affected by this provision, as it will increase their effective tax rate.
Tax is calculated in accordance with a progressive table, ranging from currently 8% on taxable income in excess of EUR 12,438 to 42% on income in excess of EUR 220,788. See the below tax brackets for the tax scale that has been adapted as of 2024:
**Taxable income (EUR) Tax rate (%)**
0 to 13,230 | 0  
---|---  
13.230 to 15.435  | 8  
15.435 to 17.640 | 9  
17.640 to 19.845  | 10  
19.845 to 22.050 | 11  
22.050 to 24.255 | 12  
24.255 to 26.550 | 14  
26.550 to 28.845 | 16  
28.845 to 31.140 | 18  
31.140 to 33.435 | 20  
33.435 to 35.730 | 22  
35.730 to 38.025 | 24  
38.025 to 40.320 | 26  
40.320 to 42.615 | 28  
42.615 to 44.910 | 30  
44.910 to 47.205 | 32  
47.205 to 49.500 | 34  
49.500 to 51.795 | 36  
51.795 to 54.090 | 38  
54.090 to 117.450 | 39  
117.450 to 176.160 | 40  
176.160 to 234.870 | 41  
234.870+ | 42  
A solidarity tax of 7% of taxes (9% for taxpayers earning more than EUR 150,000 in tax class 1 and 1a or more than EUR 300,000 in tax class 2) must also be paid.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Taxable period
The Luxembourg tax year is the calendar year.
## Tax returns
As per the Budget Law 2023, individual income tax returns of a given year should, as of tax year 2022, be filed by 31 December of the following year. The deadline for partners or spouses to submit a joint application for individual taxation is on 31 December as well. The deadline for Luxembourg residents to opt for a 20% flat and final tax over qualifying interest income, when the paying agent is located outside of Luxembourg but in the European Union, is now on 31 December.
The total income of a husband and wife and the non-salary income of minor children forming part of the household are aggregated for purposes of the annual tax computation. Combined assessments are due in principle if the spouses are not separated on the basis of a legal or judicial dispensation. Note that all taxpayers are not obligated/authorised to file an income tax return.
The annual tax return or the annual WHT adjustment form has to be filed before 31 December the year following the year the income is received. 
## Payment of tax
Payroll income taxes are withheld by the employer on a monthly basis and may be regularised, depending on the circumstances, through an annual tax return or an annual WHT adjustment (_décompte annuel_).The payment of income tax may be executed through instalments at the time the taxpayer files a tax return. These advances must be paid on a quarterly basis and are based on income tax paid in the previous year.
## Statute of limitations
Luxembourg tax authorities have up to five years to require the payment of tax or the filing of the tax return. This period may be extended if a deferred payment is granted. The general statute of limitation may be extended to ten years in case of (i) insufficient or incomplete tax return or (ii) failure to file a tax return.


# Luxembourg
## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Employment expenses
Income-related expenses are normally deductible.
Employees benefit from minimum standard deductions of EUR 540 for job-related expenses. These deductions are doubled if the spouse/civil partner is also employed. If expenses for tools, specific work clothes, and so on, exceed the minimum, the actual expenses may be deducted. Commuting expenses between home and place of work are tax deductible, at a maximum of EUR 2,574 per year.
Compulsory Luxembourg and foreign legal social security contributions covered by a social security treaty are also tax deductible.
Employee’s contributions to a qualifying employer-provided pension scheme are tax deductible up to a limit of EUR 1,200 per year.
## Personal deductions
Non-residents can deduct only expenses related to income subject to Luxembourg taxation.
Residents may deduct extraordinary charges for sickness, accidents, living costs of parents, and so on, to the extent that they exceed a certain percentage of their taxable remuneration.
In addition to the following, specific deductions are also available, notably for kindergarten costs and domestic help.
### Insurance premiums and interest expenses
For residents, certain premiums paid for life, sickness, accident, disability, and third-party liability insurance, as well as interest arising on personal loans (contracted to purchase a car, furniture, and so forth), are deductible, up to EUR 672 increased by the same amount for jointly taxable spouses/civil partners and each dependent child. This allowance is increased for a one-time premium for death insurance subscribed to assure the reimbursement of a loan taken out for the purchase of a house. The related tax deduction varies with the age of the taxpayer.
Under specific conditions, insurance premiums paid within the context of a private pension scheme qualifying under Luxembourg tax law are also tax deductible up to EUR 3,200. The deduction applies to each spouse/civil partner, provided both are covered by a private pension insurance contract.
### Home ownership savings plan
Certain contributions to home ownership savings plans are deductible, up to EUR 672 (or EUR 1,344 for individuals up to 40 years of age) increased by the same amount for jointly taxable spouses/civil partners and each dependent child.
## Standard deductions
A minimum standard deduction of EUR 480 is granted for the above expenses; it is doubled if the spouse/civil partner is also employed.
A minimum lump-sum allowance of EUR 25 is deductible from income from capital and investments subject to progressive tax rates. The minimum lump-sum allowance is doubled in the case of collectively taxed spouses/civil partners if both earn income from capital and investments. Actual expenses exceeding this lump-sum allowance can be deducted.
## Personal allowances
Jointly taxable spouses/civil partners who both exercise a professional activity taxable in Luxembourg benefit from a lump-sum allowance of EUR 4,500.
## Non-resident taxpayers
Non-resident employees may deduct compulsory social security contributions, contributions to an employer-provided supplementary pension scheme, and school and education expenses paid for a child who does not form part of the taxpayer's household, as well as the standard deduction of EUR 480.
In addition, if at least 90% of the personal worldwide income derived by a non-resident (or 50% of the professional income of the household for Belgium resident) is taxable in Luxembourg, the taxpayer may opt to be treated as a resident for tax purposes, thus benefiting from the same deductions and allowances as a resident. The tax rate applied to Luxembourg-source income is then determined on the basis of the taxpayer’s households total worldwide income.
## Extraordinary expenses
Extraordinary charges are tax-deductible only if they exceed the 'normal charge' of the household as determined by Luxembourg tax law. The costs incurred should be unpredictable, unforeseeable, and reduce the ability to pay income tax during the year (e.g. medical expenses not reimbursed by the CNS or a mutual fund, legal fees, etc.).
In addition, the costs of childcare, household employees, and home assistance for disabled individuals are deductible. The tax deduction for the contribution for child maintenance where the child is not part of the taxpayer’s household is set to EUR 4,422.
Two methods of calculation:
  * Normal charge method (the deduction will depend on your family situation and your level of taxable income).
  * Lump-sum deduction with a cap of EUR 5,400 on a yearly basis (only applicable for childcare, household employees, and home assistance for disabled individuals).


## Losses
Capital losses can be offset only against capital gains in the same year (only short terms).


# Luxembourg
## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
## Employment income
Income from employment includes all benefits in cash and in kind received by an individual and is subject to progressive income tax rates (0 to 45.78%).
If an employer provides a house or apartment to an employee, the monthly benefit in kind is valued at 25% of its unitary value, with a minimum of 75% of the rent effectively paid by the employer. If the employer also makes available the furniture contained in the accommodation, the value of the benefit in kind is increased by 10%. If the employer pays electricity and other charges, these must be added to the benefit at their nominal value. If the employee rents a house or an apartment and pays the rent, reimbursement of the rent by the employer is taxed entirely as a benefit.
The monthly benefit in kind arising from the private use of a company car corresponds to private mileage multiplied by the car’s kilometre cost. This evaluation can be replaced by a lump-sum evaluation method, according to which the monthly taxable fringe benefit corresponds to a fixed percentage (0.5% up to 1.8%) of the full purchase price of the new car (including options and VAT).
The Luxembourg government has introduced a reform of the determination of benefit in kind for company car. A new system for calculating the benefit in kind rate according to the type of engine and emissions of CO₂ has been introduced as of 1 January 2023 and will be adjusted as of 1 January 2025. As from January 2025, a rate of 2% will apply to hybrid and combustion engine. The rate of 0.5% for company cars with zero CO₂ emissions will be maintained until 31 December 2026 (extension of current favourable rate for an additional period of two years announced by the Luxembourg Government on 29 November 2024). As from 2027, a rate of 1% to 1.2% should be applied to determine the monthly taxable fringe benefit for company cars with zero CO₂ emissions.
A number of items are exempt from tax, such as debit-interest savings on a reduced or nil-interest loan granted by the employer (within certain limits) and additional salary for overtime payments under certain conditions.
Non-residents are taxed on salaried income if their occupation is exercised in Luxembourg or if their salary is paid from Luxembourg. Tax treaties generally grant exemption if the non-resident stays for less than 183 days in the calendar year and if the remuneration is neither paid nor borne by a Luxembourg entity.
### Impatriate tax regime
Under certain conditions, individuals hired from abroad or seconded from abroad to Luxembourg and becoming Luxembourg tax residents may qualify for the impatriate tax regime. The regime currently allows the employer to provide certain benefits and allowances in a tax-free manner or with a partial tax exemption. As from 1 January 2025, the regime will allow for a 50% tax exemption of the compensation capped at EUR 400,000 (i.e. a maximum EUR 200,000 yearly tax exemption).
The regime requires that the individual is highly qualified, was not subject to tax in Luxembourg nor resided in Luxembourg nor lived within 150km from Luxembourg border for the last 5 years prior to the beginning of the Luxembourg activities. Other conditions also apply to the employee and the employer.
The regime can apply for the year of arrival and the following 8 years.
### Profit-sharing scheme rules _(prime participative)_
Under the profit-sharing scheme rules (_prime participative_) introduced in 2021, Luxembourg companies can provide a premium to employees, 50% of which is exempt from tax. Any beneficiary of the scheme must be an employee and be affiliated to a social security scheme either in Luxembourg or abroad in a country that has a bi- or multi-lateral agreement for social security purposes with Luxembourg. The premium is paid at the sole discretion of the employer.
The following conditions and limits currently apply to the implementation of the profit-sharing scheme:
  * The employer/company must earn its revenue from the following categories of income: commercial profits, farming, forestry, or independent activities.
  * The employer must have proper accounts during the year in which the bonus is paid as well as for the prior tax year.
  * The total amount that can be allocated to employees as part of the profit-sharing scheme cannot exceed 5% of the profits of the business of the prior year. The 5% limit is increased to 7.5% as from 1 January 2025.
  * Details of the profit-sharing scheme in a prescribed form must be provided to the WHT office for verification at the time of implementation of the profit-sharing scheme.
  * The payment cannot exceed 25% of the beneficiary’s gross annual remuneration (excluding benefits in kind and in cash and the bonus itself). The 25% limit is increased to 30% as from 1 January 2025.


To provide more flexibility to Luxembourg companies in a tax unity group, the 2023 Budget Law provided that, under certain conditions, companies can opt to assess the above 5% limit by adding the after-tax profit of the members of the tax unity group.
## Capital gains
Capital gains derived from the disposal of movable properties are subject to Luxembourg progressive income tax rates (0% to 45.78%), provided the holding period is less than six months and to the extent that the total capital gains exceed EUR 500. If movable properties are disposed of more than six months following their acquisition, capital gains are not taxed unless the individual holds an important participation (material interest).
Capital gains derived from the disposal of material interest after the six-month period are taxed as extraordinary income at half the average combined tax rate (maximum 22.89%).
An interest generally qualifies as material when the individual taxpayer (together with their household) holds or has held, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the corporate capital during the five years prior to the date on which the shares are disposed of.
Capital gains on the sale of the taxpayer’s main residence are tax-exempt. Capital gains on the other real estate property are subject to the following:
  * Progressive income tax rates if the disposal takes place within two years of the acquisition. As of tax year 2025, the speculation period will be extended from two years to five years. Therefore, capital gains resulting from the sale of real estate property will be taxable at progressive income tax rates if the gain is realised within a period of five years following the acquisition, instead of the current two years.
  * Reduced tax rate if the disposal takes place more than two years after acquisition. The reduced rate is effectively half of the marginal tax rate. If the gain is realised in 2024, the gain will be temporarily subject to a quarter of the marginal tax rate. A tax deduction of up to EUR 50,000 (double for married taxpayers and civil partners filling) valid every ten years may be claimed on the capital gain. In addition, a deduction up to EUR 75,000 for inherited property (through the direct line of descendance) may apply.
  * Under specific conditions, taxation of capital gains from the disposal of property can be deferred if it is used to fund the acquisition of a new property located in Luxembourg that the owner intends to rent out.


For long-term capital gains (holding period of more than six months for movable property and two years for immovable property), the acquisition price is adjusted by taking into account inflation coefficients.
## Investment income
Investment income is subject to a dual tax regime.
Whereas some interest payments are subject to a 20% WHT in full discharge of PIT, other incomes (interest not qualifying for the 20% WHT, dividends) are taxed pursuant to progressive rates after a deduction of EUR 1,500.
The above-mentioned deduction is doubled in the case of collectively taxed spouses/civil partners. In addition, half of the dividend income received is tax exempt if paid by a qualifying company.
## Rental income
Income from real estate located in Luxembourg is subject to progressive income tax rates (maximum 45.78%).
Income from real estate located abroad is generally not taxed in Luxembourg under double tax treaty (DTT) provisions. For residents, said income is taken into account to determine the global tax rate applying to their income taxable in Luxembourg.
For rental properties, the depreciation rate situation will depend on when the property was purchased, as follows:
  * Rental property acquired (or completed) before 1 January 2021:


    * If the completion is less than six years: 6%.
    * If the completion is six years or more: 2%.


  * Rental property acquired (or completed) between 1 January 2021and 31 December 2022: 
    * If the completion is less than five years: 4% (additional tax rebate amounting to 1% of the basis considered for the calculation of the 4% depreciation is also available under certain conditions and limits).
    * If the completion is five years or more: 2%.
  * Rental property acquired (or completed) since 1 January 2023: 
    * If the completion is less than five years: 4% to a maximum of two buildings or parts of buildings used for rental housing (additional tax rebate amounting to 1% of the basis considered for the calculation of the 4% depreciation is also available under certain conditions and limits, i.e. _abattement immobilier spécial_).
    * If the completion is five years or more: 2%.


Investment expenses related to sustainable energy renovation completed less than nine years prior to January 1 of the tax year of a building or part of a building used for rental housing benefit from a depreciation rate of 6%.
### Sustainable affordable housing
The net rental income is determined by deducting rental expenses from the gross rental income. Expenses include, for instance, interest incurred on mortgage loan, repairs/maintenance costs, insurance premium paid (fire, civil liability), and depreciation.
Currently, for depreciation of construction, the amortisation rate varies from 2% to 4% depending on the year of construction of the building, except land (lump-sum calculation of 20% of the acquisition price if price of land at acquisition is unknown). Alternatively, if the taxpayer does not have any actual expenses, a lump-sum deduction may be applied.
## Exempt income
Very little income is exempt from Luxembourg tax; however, some examples of exempt income include:
  * Lottery winnings.
  * Gifts made by the employer based on the employee's seniority (up to certain limits).
  * Redundancy payments (under conditions and limits).

## Individual - Other tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 21 January 2025
The following three tax credits are available:
  * Employee tax credit varies between EUR 0 and EUR 600 depending on the level of income.
  * Pensioner tax credit varies between EUR 0 and EUR 600 depending on the level of income.
  * Single parent tax credit varies between EUR 750 and EUR 2,505 depending on the level of income.


Each of these credits may give rise to a tax refund even where the final taxes are lower than the credit itself.
The Budget Law for 2019 introduced the CISSM (_Crédit d'impôt salaire social minimum_), which applies to employees and apprentices when their salary is between EUR 1,800 and EUR 3,000. The amount of the CISSM varies according to the gross salary. Between EUR 1,800 and EUR 3,000, the amount of the CISSM is EUR 70.00. Between EUR 3,000 and EUR 3,600, the amount of the CISSM is degressive and is calculated as follows: 70/600 x (3,600 - gross monthly salary) EUR per month.
The tax credit for minimum wage earners of EUR 70 per month currently only applies to employees earning a monthly gross wage of between EUR 1,800 and EUR 3,600. 
On 11 December 2024, the Luxembourg Parliament voted to approve bill 8388 amending the Luxembourg tax legislation. The bill introduces several amendments aiming to address some recent jurisprudential developments, to clarify some technical aspects of the tax law, and to simplify and digitalise some administrative procedures. One of the amendments proposed by the draft law relates to the introduction of a new scale tax credit (_credit d'impôt barème_) for the 2024 tax year to compensate potential loss of professional income for certain taxpayers due to the end of the temporary tax credit (_crédit d'impôt conjoncture_).
Following the abolishment of the temporary tax credit (_crédit d'impôt conjoncture_) introduced in 2023, certain taxpayers subject to tax class 1a and 2 may face negative financial consequences. Therefore, a new tax credit is introduced for the 2024 tax year for taxpayers subject to the same tax class 1a or 2 for 2023 and 2024 and earning professional income (as defined in article 2 LITL) for each of these taxpayers taxable in Luxembourg. Conditions to benefit from the scale tax credit vary depending on the personal/marital situation of the taxpayers. The tax credit amounts to EUR 108.

## Social security contributions
Compulsory social security contributions for employees are listed below:
  * For sickness: 2.80% of gross periodic remuneration, which is limited to a monthly ceiling of EUR 13,188.96 (annual ceiling estimated at EUR 158,267.52 as of 1 January 2025).
  * For pension: 8% of gross remuneration, which is limited to a monthly ceiling of EUR 13,188.96 (annual ceiling estimated at EUR 158,267.52 as of 1 January 2025).


The social security contributions have to be withheld by the employer from the employee's gross salary.
Certain multilateral and bilateral social security agreements protect the interests of temporarily resident employees.
Employees (residents and non-residents) paying Luxembourg social security contributions are subject to the so-called dependency contribution on their gross professional income, reduced by EUR 659.45 per month (i.e. estimated at EUR 7,913.40 as of 1 January 2025). Net portfolio income and taxable capital gains of Luxembourg resident taxpayers are also subject to the dependency contribution, except for interest within the scope of the 20% withholding tax (WHT) in full discharge of income tax. The dependency contribution rate amounts to 1.4% (flat rate).
## Consumption taxes
### Value-added tax (VAT)
Supplies of good and services, which are deemed to take place in Luxembourg from a VAT perspective, are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 17% (lowest standard VAT rate in the European Union) or, on certain transactions, at 14% (e.g. certain wines, advertising pamphlets, management and safekeeping of securities), 8% (e.g. supply of gas or electricity), or 3% (e.g. food [except alcohol beverages], pharmaceutical products, books, radio and television broadcasting services [except adult entertainment], or shoes, accessories, and clothes designed for children under the age of 14). _See the section in the Corporate tax summary for more information_.
## Net wealth/worth taxes
Wealth taxes have been abolished from 1 January 2006 for individuals (resident and non-resident).
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
Indirect taxes apply to inheritances and gifts. These taxes are levied by the _Administration de l'Enregistrement et des Domaines_.
### Inheritance tax
Inheritance taxes are levied on the whole estate left by an inhabitant of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg at the time of their death, except real estate located abroad and movable goods located abroad, which are taxed by reference to the citizenship of the deceased.
A person is deemed to be a Luxembourg inhabitant, and thus liable to inheritance tax, if they have their domicile and the centre of their activities there.
The residence of the heirs has no impact on inheritance taxes due in Luxembourg.
Regarding the inheritance tax rates, each beneficiary is taxed separately based on the value of the net share attributed to them, less personal allowances.
It should be noted that the tax rates differ depending on the degree of relationship between the heir and the deceased.
### Measure to simplify successions exempt from inheritance tax
The Bill n°7666 introduced an amendment to the law dated 28 January 1948 on registration and succession duties. The purpose of the measure is to introduce for heirs, in the context of successions exempt from inheritance tax, an efficient means of access to moveable assets of a succession held by a third party (such as credit institutions), by giving a civil scope to the certificate issued by the Luxembourg indirect tax authorities. It is primarily an administrative simplification measure.
The certificate issued by the Luxembourg indirect tax authorities in case of a succession exempt from inheritance tax would therefore henceforth have both fiscal and civil scope. From now on, any third-party holder of moveable property that is part of a succession would be required to accept this certificate as proof of the capacity of the heir that holds the certificate.
### Death duty
Death duties are levied on real estate located in Luxembourg that is left by a person who is not an inhabitant of Luxembourg. No tax is due on movable property located in Luxembourg and owned by a person who is not an inhabitant of Luxembourg. The residence of the heirs has no impact on death duty levied in Luxembourg.
### Gift tax
Tax is levied on gifts made during the individual's lifetime (i.e. _inter vivos_ gifts).
A notarial deed is, in principle, required to evidence gifts under Luxembourg law. Gifts that are not required to be made in writing (e.g. gifts on movable assets transferred by hand delivery or _dons manuels_) are generally accepted without notarial deed and thus without registration. In this case, no tax is due, except if the donor dies within the civil year (the value of the gift is then reintegrated in the transferred estate for the computation of inheritance tax).
Gift taxes are based on a percentage. The percentage duty depends on the degree of relationship between the donor and the donee. For gift tax purposes, the fiscal domicile of the donee and the donor are irrelevant. Moreover, gifts of immovable property may be subject to an additional transfer duty of 1% (_droit de transcription_).
_Inter vivos_ gifts to direct line heirs, which qualify as ancestors' partition (_partage d'ascendants_), are exempt from transfer duty.
## Property tax
Luxembourg municipalities levy a property tax and are responsible for the final tax assessment. The property tax is calculated using the following formula: Tax base x communal rate.
The tax base corresponds to the unitary value assigned by the property assessment department of the tax authorities (called '_section des évaluations immobilières_ ') multiplied by the assessment rate (between 0.7% and 1%).
The communal rate is fixed annually by the municipalities and varies between 200% and 400%, depending on the location and category of the property.
## Luxury and excise taxes
There are no luxury and excise taxes applicable to individuals in Luxembourg.
