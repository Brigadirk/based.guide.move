## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 20 July 2024
The tax law does not prescribe special provisions for taxation of branches; consequently, tax rates on the profits of PEs are the same as for domestic corporations. PEs are subject to tax at a rate of 28% and treated as domestic companies.
A branch is considered a PE for the parent company; consequently, it is taxed on the income that is sourced from Rwanda only.
