## Individual - Foreign tax relief and tax treaties
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
## Foreign tax relief
As a result of the source rules and the exempt status of dividends, few items subject to foreign tax are liable to Namibian taxation. There is no general unilateral provision for relief from double taxation, although a specific provision prevents double taxation of royalties.
## Tax treaties
In the event that Namibia has entered into a double taxation agreement (DTA) with the country where the foreign resident resides, such individual will be taxable in Namibia, unless all the requirements of the specific DTA are met.
Namibia has entered into DTAs with the following countries:
Botswana | Malaysia | South Africa  
---|---|---  
France | Mauritius | Sweden  
Germany | Romania | United Kingdom  
India | Russian Federation
