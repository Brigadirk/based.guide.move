## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 17 December 2024
WHTs are applicable where certain payments are made to non-Namibian residents.
## Dividends
Dividends declared by a Namibian company to a non-resident holding company are subject to NRST, a WHT. NRST is payable at the standard rate of 10% if at least 25% of shares are held in the Namibian company and the shareholder is a company. In all other cases, the NRST payable is 20%. DTA relief may be available.
NRST is payable within 20 days following the month that the dividends were declared.
## Interest
A WHT of 10%, calculated on the gross amount of interest, is payable on interest accruing to any person, other than a Namibian company, from a registered Namibian banking institution or unit trust scheme. The tax withheld is a final tax, and the financial institution is responsible to withhold the tax.
Namibian companies, however, are taxed on interest at the corporate tax rate.
It is the obligation of the financial institution to withhold the tax and pay such tax to the revenue authorities.
WHT of 10% is payable on the interest accruing or paid to a non-resident. The WHT is payable within 20 days after the interest payment was made. Interest is deemed to be paid on the earlier of the date on which the interest is paid or becomes due and payable.
Treaty relief may be available.
## Royalties or similar payments
WHT on royalties are payable when a Namibian company pays a royalty to a non-resident. WHT is levied at a fixed rate of 10% and is payable within 20 days after the end of the month during which the liability for payment is incurred.
A royalty includes payment for the use or right to use any patent or design, trademark, copyright, model, pattern, plan, formula, or process, or any other property or right of a similar nature. A royalty also includes the imparting of any scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge or information for use in Namibia. The nature of fees payable should therefore be carefully considered in order to determine whether the relevant amount represents a royalty. It also include payments made for the use or right to use industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment (i.e. rentals).
Treaty relief may be available.
## Services
Any Namibian resident paying a management or consultancy fee to a non-resident must withhold tax at 10%.
Management and consulting fees are specifically defined as: "any amount payable for administrative, managerial, technical, or consultative services or any similar services, whether such services are of a professional nature or not".
A branch is specifically included in the definition of a resident.
The rate is subject to DTA relief, where applicable.
Fees paid to non-resident directors and foreign entertainers are subject to WHT of 25%. No treaty relief is available.
## Summary of WHT payable
