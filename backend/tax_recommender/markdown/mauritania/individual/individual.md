The General Tax Code (GTC) was modified from fiscal year (FY) 2020. Under the new Code, from January 2020, individuals performing gainful activity for themselves are subject to a personal income tax (PIT), covering industrial and commercial, as well as non-commercial, incomes.
This PIT includes the following three tax regimes:
  * A normal regime for an annual turnover exceeding 5 million Mauritanian ouguiya (MRU).
  * An intermediary regime for an annual turnover between MRU 3 million and MRU 5 million.
  * A lump-sum tax regime for an annual turnover less than MRU 3 million, excluding importers.
