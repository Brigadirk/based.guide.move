## Social security contributions
The Social Security Act 2012 requires an employer with more than five workers to provide Social Security Scheme benefits to one’s workers, such as health and social care insurance as well as insurance against employment-related injuries.
The rates of contribution by employees and employers are 2% and 3% of the total salaries and wages, respectively. The contribution must be in Myanmar kyats regardless of the currency in which the employee is paid.
With effect from 1 April 2014, the maximum monthly contribution is limited to MMK 9,000 by the employer and MMK 6,000 by the employee.
Contributions are deductible by the employee for tax purposes. The employer is obligated to withhold the employees’ contributions from their salaries.
## Capital gains taxes
Income tax is levied on gains from the sale, exchange, or transfer of capital assets (i.e. any land, building, vehicle, and any capital assets of an enterprise, which include shares, bonds, and similar instruments) and intangibles (to the extent they fall within the definition of capital assets).
Capital gains are calculated based on the difference between sale proceeds and the cost of assets and any additions, less tax depreciation allowed.
