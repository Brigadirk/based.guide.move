# Bahrain
## Overview
Last reviewed - 20 March 2024
The Kingdom of Bahrain is an archipelago of 33 islands covering a total area of 741 square kilometres in the Arabian Gulf, located east of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and northwest of Qatar. The capital of Bahrain is Manama, and the population of Bahrain is approximately 1.57 million. The official language of Bahrain is Arabic, and the currency is the Bahraini dinar (BHD).
Bahrain was one of the first countries in the Middle East to discover crude oil. Though oil revenues continue to provide a sizeable proportion of Bahrain’s gross domestic product (GDP), the country is expanding in the financial services, real estate and construction, and manufacturing sectors. Bahrain’s GDP grew by 4.9% in 2022, which is the highest growth rate recorded since 2013.
Bahrain implemented the first Free Trade Agreement with the United States in August 2006. Bahrain is also a member of the Cooperation Council for the Arab states of the Gulf (GCC).
