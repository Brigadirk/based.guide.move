## Wage protection system
Qatar introduced a wage protection system (WPS) requiring all salaries of employees of a Qatar branch or company in the State of Qatar to be paid into an employee bank account in Qatar and various details on each employee to be provided. This information may be used to cross reference to Minister of Labour records of registered employees and possibly to wages and salaries cost in financial statements.
