Notes
  1. Interest paid by the government and the Central Bank of Kenya is tax-exempt.
  2. No Kenya tax is due if subject to tax in Zambia.
  3. 8% if the beneficiary holds at least 25% of the capital of the company paying the dividends.
  4. A rate of 10% is applicable where the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) that directly or indirectly holds less than 10% of the capital of the company paying the dividends.
  5. The treaties do not contain separate Articles on 'management or professional services'. Under the OECD model tax agreement guidelines, such income from such services should be taxed only in the country of residence of the recipient of the income unless the source country has taxing rights in accordance with the Article dealing with 'business profits' (i.e. where there is a PE in the other state). Despite the KRA taking the position that the 'management or professional fees' would fall under the Article on 'other income' and should therefore be subject to WHT at 20%, the High Court has confirmed that the management and professional fees are taxable as business profits as per the OECD model tax agreement guidelines.


Where the treaty rate is higher than the non-treaty rate, the lower rate applies.
