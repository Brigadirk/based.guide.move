## Foreign tax credit
There is no tax credit for foreign tax paid on business income except as provided for by a DTT (if applicable) between Kenya and the other country. However, foreign tax paid may be deducted as an expense.
## Investment deduction
The Finance Act, 2022 reintroduced the 150% investment deduction allowance to projects where the cumulative investment value for the preceding four years from the date the provision came into effect or the cumulative investment for the succeeding three years outside Nairobi County or Mombasa County is at least KES 2 billion.
## Export processing zone (EPZ)
Companies located in an approved EPZ, principally to export goods, are taxed at a 0% CIT rate for ten years from commencement and at a rate of 25% for the next ten years.
## Special economic zones (SEZs)
SEZ enterprises are not required to register for VAT. The supply of goods or taxable services to an SEZ is subject to VAT at 0% (zero rated).  _See the_ _section for the CIT rates_.
