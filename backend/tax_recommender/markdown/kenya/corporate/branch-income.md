## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 18 February 2025
The profit of a PE is taxed at the branch income tax rate of 30%, but there is no further taxation on the distribution of branch profits. There are certain restrictions with respect to the tax deductibility of certain costs, such as royalties, interest, and management fees, paid to the head office. However, these payments are also not subject to WHT.
