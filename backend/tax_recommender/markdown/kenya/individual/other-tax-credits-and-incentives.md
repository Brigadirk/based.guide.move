## Personal relief
Personal relief is minimal. From April 2020, the relief is KES 28,800 per _annum_ or KES 2,400 per month. Where an employee has more than one employer, they are entitled to claim personal relief credit through only one employer.
## Insurance relief
A resident individual shall be entitled to insurance relief at a rate of 15% of the insurance premiums paid, subject to a maximum relief of KES 5,000 per month (or KES 60,000 per annum), provided the individual can prove that:
  * they have paid premiums for life insurance for themselves, their spouse, or their children and that the insurance secures a capital sum payable in Kenya and is in Kenyan currency
  * their employer has paid premiums for the benefit of that individual that has been charged to tax on that employee, or
  * both the employee and the employer have paid insurance premiums.


## Post-retirement medical fund (PRMF) deduction
The Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2024 amended Section 15(2) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) to include contributions made to a PRMF as allowable deductions for employees. This change also involved deleting the existing provision of a 15% post-tax relief provided for in the ITA which was effective from 1 January 2024.
