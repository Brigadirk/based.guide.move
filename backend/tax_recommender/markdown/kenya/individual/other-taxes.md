Households with income from salaried employment shall contribute 2.75% of their gross salary or wage for each month.

The filing and payment of AHL is done through the iTax system. Employers should declare AHL in the monthly PAYE return (Form P10) under the sheet M (Affordable Housing Levy details).
Failure to remit AHL by the due date attracts a penalty of 3% per month on the outstanding amount.
