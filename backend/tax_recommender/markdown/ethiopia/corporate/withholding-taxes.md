## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 12 February 2025
Generally, payments for supply of goods (worth ETB 10,000 or more) and provision of services (worth ETB 3,000 or more) to a resident person are subject to WHT at the rate of 2%.
The 2% WHT applies if the supplier provides a valid tax identification number (TIN) and a business licence. If the TIN and the licence are not provided at the time of making the payment, the payer is required to subject the payment to a 30% WHT rate.
On other qualifying payments, WHT is levied at varying rates on a range of payments to residents and non-residents. Resident WHT is a final tax or creditable against CIT.
