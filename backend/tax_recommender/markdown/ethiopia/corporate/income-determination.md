## Foreign currency exchange gains/losses
All net gains or losses arising from transactions in foreign exchange are considered to be taxable income or deductible losses in the year in which they arise. Effective 2021, a person is allowed to either capitalise and claim tax depreciation on foreign exchange loss incurred in acquiring a capital asset or deduct realised foreign exchange loss incurred in relation to operating expenses.
Prior to 2021, taxpayers were only required to offset realised foreign exchange losses against realised foreign exchange gains as opposed to deducting the losses against the business income.
