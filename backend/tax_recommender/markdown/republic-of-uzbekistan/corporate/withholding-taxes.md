## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 09 February 2025
WHT is to be withheld and remitted to the state budget by entities paying income to non-residents if these entities qualify under a tax agent definition (i.e. by [i] Uzbek legal entities and [ii] non-residents operating in Uzbekistan via PE).
Income of non-residents subject to WHT (including income in the form of dividends, interest, and royalties) is to be paid without withholding of WHT at source or with application of a reduced WHT rate as provided by the tax treaty (with certain exemptions), provided that there is a duly formalised tax certificate issued by a competent authority confirming that non-residents are registered for tax purposes in the state with which Uzbekistan has the effective tax treaty.
The domestic WHT rates are as follows:
Payment | WHT (%)  
---|---  
Dividends and interest to residents | 5  
Dividends and interest to non-residents | 10  
Insurance and reinsurance payments | 10  
Freight | 6  
Royalties, services (including management, consulting services), rents, other income | 20  
## Double taxation treaty (DTT) relief
Foreign legal entities that do not carry on activities in Uzbekistan through a PE are subject to WHT on income from sources in Uzbekistan, subject to the terms of a relevant DTT. Uzbekistan has enforced DTTs with 55 countries.
DTTs in force establish WHT rates as follows:
