## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
WHT is imposed on the following payments by residents to a resident:
Type of payment | WHT rate (%) | Final/non-final tax  
---|---|---  
Dividends | 0 | Final  
Interest | 0 | Not final  
Royalties | 10 | Not final, except where paid to an individual  
Rent (land and building) | 10 | Not final, except where paid to an individual  
Prize and winnings | 10 | Final  
Construction/building activities | 2 | Final *  
Construction consulting services | 4 | Final *  
Air and sea transportation | 2.64 | Final *  
Mining and mining support services | 4.5 | Final *  
* The default position is that such amounts will be a final tax. The income recipient can elect to have these payments for services not subjected to final tax by submitting a notification letter to the Timor-Leste Revenue Service.
Payments of Timor-Leste-source income made by a resident to a non-resident are subject to WHT at 10%. Timor-Leste has entered into a double taxation treaty (DTT) with Portugal (although elements of DTT relief are also embedded in the Timor Sea Treaty [TST], _see Taxation of petroleum operations in the section_).
Where WHT is applied as a final tax, the taxed income is not included in the recipientsâ€™ taxable income for income tax purposes. Accordingly, expenses incurred in deriving income that is subject to final tax are not deductible for income tax purposes.
