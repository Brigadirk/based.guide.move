  * if the failure was due to gross carelessness on the part of the person, further additional tax of 25% of the tax that remains unpaid, or
  * if the failure was due to a deliberate attempt to avoid payment of tax, further additional tax of 100% of the tax that remains unpaid.


If a taxpayer has understated the tax due in the tax form, that taxpayer shall be liable to an additional tax of 15% and:

## Tax audit process
Assessments may occur upon the following:
  * The delivery of a tax return form and payment.
  * After receipt of a return where the Commissioner believes a return is incorrect.
  * Where a taxpayer fails to file a return.


Assessments may be amended according to the following events:
  * By the taxpayer upon delivery to the Commissioner of an amended assessment.
  * Via a taxpayer request to the Commissioner.
  * Via specific amendment by the Commissioner.


## Statute of limitations
The Timor-Leste Revenue Service may issue an assessment notice or amend an assessment notice only within five years from the date of filing of the return. In the event of a deliberate tax evasion or fraud, there is no time limit for the issuance of an assessment notice.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Based on our experience, the Timor-Leste tax authorities are focussing on the timely remittance of the tax obligations. From an industry perspective, the oil and gas sector continues to be a focus. Finally, there have been numerous challenges of tax concessions granted on a contractual basis, including by government agencies.
