## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 23 July 2024
The taxable income of a non-resident carrying out business activities through a PE is calculated by reference to:
  * the income attributable to the PE 
  * any sales of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through the PE, and 
  * any other business activities carried on in Timor-Leste of the same or similar kind as those effected through the PE. 


Other principles for determining the taxable income of a PE in Timor-Leste include the following:
  * Profit is calculated as if the PE was a Timor-Leste entity engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealt with wholly independently from the non-resident person of which it is a PE. 
  * Subject to this, deductions may be claimed for expenses incurred for the purposes of the business activities of the PE, including head office expenditures, whether incurred in Timor-Leste or elsewhere. 
  * No deductions may be claimed for amounts paid or payable by the PE to its head office or to another PE of the non-resident person, other than towards the reimbursement of actual expenses incurred by the non-resident person to third parties, by way of: 
    * royalties, fees, or other similar payments 
    * compensation for any services (including management services) provided to the PE, and 
    * interest on money lent to the PE (except for banking businesses).
