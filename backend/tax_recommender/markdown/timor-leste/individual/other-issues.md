## Taxation of petroleum operations
The taxation of petroleum operations in Timor-Leste is partly covered by the TDA. However, the TDA operates only to modify the taxation of petroleum activities pursuant to a number of legacy tax regimes. These modifications apply to contractors, sub-contractors, and any other parties receiving income from the supply of goods or services to a contractor or sub-contractor.
Specific provisions for the taxation of petroleum operations include a personal income tax (PIT) rate of 30% for residents or 20% for non-residents.
