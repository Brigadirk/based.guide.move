Taxpayers may choose one of the following procedures for computing estimated quarterly tax liability:
  * Tax on income shown by partial closure of accounts or computation of presumed liquidation of operations at the end of each quarter. 
  * Tax on 5% of overall gross income earned during the corresponding quarter of the preceding year (5% of the 30% income tax rate equals 1.5%). 
  * Tax equivalent to one-fourth of the tax paid for the immediately preceding tax year. 


### Simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities
Under the simplified optional system on income from lucrative activities, tax is payable via flat tax withholdings (the tax is to be retained by either the customer or the recipient of services) or by direct remittances to the tax office made monthly within the first ten working days of the month following the invoice date.
Taxes on income are governed by the income tax law, _Ley de Actualizaci√≥n Tributaria_ , and its related regulations. Administration of the law is vested with the SAT.
Taxpayers registered before the tax administration under this system will settle and pay the tax through the withholding system. Persons or entities obligated to withhold are those taxpayers who pay or credit into account for the acquisition of goods and services to the taxpayers registered under this system.

In the same period, taxpayers must exercise their right of recourse for overpaid or unduly charged taxes, interest, penalties, and fines.
