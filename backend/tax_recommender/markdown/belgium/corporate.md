## Federal government negotiations: expected tax reform 
In the context of the federal government negotiations, a tax reform is anticipated following the elections held on 9 June 2024. Although proposals for adjustments to certain tax measures are being negotiated, in December 2024 no agreement has been reached yet.
## Changes to the Belgian transfer pricing documentation forms (Royal Decree of 16 June 2024, Official Gazette of 15 July 2024)
The Belgian administration has published adjusted transfer pricing documentation forms and guidance (Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country Reporting). The adjusted forms (275 LF, 275 MF and 275 CBC NOT) and explanatory notices were included in the Royal Decree dated 16 June 2024 and were published on 15 July 2024 in the Belgian Official Gazette. The adjusted forms will come into effect from financial years starting per 1 January 2025.
The most significant adjustments are on the form 275LF where transactions in Part B must be completed per country instead of aggregating the countries and the form 275CBC NOT where a notification can be the first notification, a change in the previous notification or a termination of the notification if the Belgian entity is no longer part of the Multinational group.
## Public CbC Reporting law of 8 January 2024 (Official Gazette of 26 January 2024) and Royal decree of 18 April 2024 (Official Gazette of 6 June 2024)
The Public CbC Reporting Directive has been implemented by the law of 8 January 2024 and the Royal decree of 18 April 2024.
Companies that fall in scope of the Belgian Public CbC Reporting law are: (i) Belgian (parent) companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 750 million and subject to income taxation in multiple jurisdictions as well as (ii) non-European parent companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 750 million that are economically active in Belgium through a subsidiary or branch and subject to the Belgian tax system.
Although the Belgian Public CbC Reporting law was generally drawn up to be consistent with the Directive, specific deviations include, among others:
  * The Belgian Public CbC Reporting law defines small enterprises as entities with a yearly turnover below EUR 9 million for at least two consecutive financial years as opposed to the EU Directive, which applies a EUR 8 million threshold.
  * In principle, entities in scope must publish their Public CbC Reporting on their company website and simultaneously file it with the Balance Sheet Centre of the National Bank of Belgium.
  * Disaggregated information should not only be published for jurisdictions that are mentioned on the blacklist (the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes) or on the greylist (list of the state of play of cooperative jurisdictions that have taken commitments to implement tax good governance principles), but also for those jurisdictions on the (generally broader) Belgian lists of countries with no or low taxation (so-called DRD list and Belgian list for payments to tax havens) or rated by the global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes as non-compliant or only partially compliant.
  * An exception to the scope not only applies for credit institutions but also for regulated stock broking companies.
  * The Belgian Public CbC Reporting law adopts the filing term of 12 months after the closing date, which differs from the filing term of seven months for the filing of annual accounts as provided for in the Belgian Companies and Associations Code.
  * The Belgian Public CbC Reporting law does not provide for a ‘safeguarding clause’ to defer disclosure of commercially sensitive information.
  * Members of a management body, as well as persons entrusted with the governance of an establishment in Belgium, who fail to comply with the Belgian Public CbC Reporting requirements could be punished with a fine of between EUR 50 and EUR 10,000 (and/or a prison sentence of up to one year in the case of fraudulent intent).


It is important to bear in mind that CbC Report data will soon be publicly available as the first Belgian Public CbC Report must be published for financial years starting on or after 22 June 2024. Hence, the first Belgian Public CbC Report filing date is set at 21 June 2026 (31 December 2026 for companies with financial statements following the calendar year).
## Law of 12 May 2024 on various tax provisions (Official Gazette of 29 May 2024)
On 29 May 2024, the law of 12 May 2024 containing various tax provisions was published in the Belgian Official Gazette. This law implements several changes to the regime of the investment deduction and the innovation income deduction (IID).
The new regime is organised around three 'tracks':
  * The general track: Ordinary investment deduction (10% or 20% [qualifying digital investments, Royal Decree still to be published]). This is only applicable to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
  * The targeted track: An increased 'thematic' investment deduction (replacing the specific categories of qualifying investments) (40% [SME] or 30% [non-SME]). A list of eligible investments for this investment deduction are published by the Royal Decree of 20 December 2024 (Official Gazette of 31 December 2024) and will be reviewed/updated periodically. The increased thematic deduction will only be applicable to fixed assets for which no regional aid is requested (exceptions to be determined by the King).
  * The technology track: The so-called ’technology‘ deduction applies in relation to qualifying investments in patents and fixed assets that are used to support R&D of new products and future-oriented technologies that have no impact on the environment or that aim to minimise the negative impact on the environment of existing products and technologies (13.5% [one-off] or 20.5% [spread, not applicable to patents]). Taxpayers could opt to apply a tax credit for this category of investments.


The law provides for fixed investment deduction rates. Hence, going forward, these rates will no longer be subject to the yearly indexation mechanism.
A taxpayer can only choose one of the above-mentioned types of investment deduction per fixed asset.
The general conditions to benefit from the investment deduction remain the same.
The new regime, as well as the correction related to the (partial) professional withholding tax (WHT) exemption regime to determine the investment deduction basis, will be applicable for investments made as of 1 January 2025.
In addition, the law of 12 May 2024 provides for the following modifications to the IID and tax credit for innovation income:
  * As of tax year 2025, taxpayers will have the option not to offset part or the full amount of IID against the taxable basis but to convert it into a non-refundable tax credit for innovation income.
  * The tax credit for innovation income can be carried forward and offset against CIT of (one of) the following taxable periods. Taxpayers will have the choice for each taxable period whether or not to apply this tax credit.
  * From 2026 onwards, the effect of the tax credit for innovation income will be evaluated on a yearly basis, paying special attention to the budgetary cost of the measure and Belgium’s competitive position compared to neighbouring countries.




# Belgium
## Corporate - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Taxable period
The assessment is based on the taxable income of a financial year. For the application of the rules on statutory limitations and of new laws, a tax year is related to each taxable period. If the financial year corresponds with the calendar year, the tax year is the following calendar year (e.g. financial year closing 31 December 2024 corresponds with tax year 2025). If the financial year does not correspond with the calendar year, the tax year, in principle, equals the calendar year during which the financial year ends (e.g. financial year closing 30 June 2024 corresponds with tax year 2024).
## Tax returns
As a general rule, the annual resident or non-resident CIT return must be filed, at the latest, on 30 September of the tax year for financial years ending between 31 December of the previous year and the last day of February of the tax year. For instance, assuming that the accounting year has been closed on 31 December 2024, the corporate tax return needs to be filed, in principle, by 30 September 2025 at the latest.
In other cases, the deadline for filing the tax return is the last day of the seventh month following the end of the financial year.
An extension of the deadline is possible in case of serious reasons or force majeure.
## Payment of tax
CIT is payable within two months (some temporary exceptions apply) following the issue of the tax assessment. Interest for late payment is charted at the (non-cumulative) rate of 4% per year.
The advance tax payments needed to avoid the CIT surcharge (_see the section_) can be made in quarterly instalments. In the situation where the company's financial year ends on 31 December 2024, the due dates for the advance tax payments are 10 April 2024, 10 July 2024, 10 October 2024, and 20 December 2024. If the due date is a Saturday, Sunday, or a bank holiday, the payment is due on the next working day.
Advance tax payments give rise to a tax credit. For tax year 2025, the tax credit amounts to 12%, 10%, 8%, or 6% of the advance tax payment made, depending on whether such payment has been made, respectively, in the first, second, third, or fourth quarter.
If the total amount of credits exceeds the surcharge, no surcharge is due, but the excess is not further taken into account for the final tax computation. The taxpayer can choose to either have the excess reimbursed by the tax authorities or used as an advance tax payment for the next year.
## Tax audit process
A tax audit normally begins with a written request for information from the tax inspector. The taxpayer must provide the data requested within (in principle) one month. Any documentary evidence considered relevant to the audit can be requested and reviewed by the authorities. Once the tax inspector has completed the analysis, any adjustment is proposed in a notification of amendment outlining the reasons for the proposed amendment. The taxpayer has a month to agree or to express disagreement. The tax inspector then makes an assessment for the amount of tax that the tax inspector believes is due (taking into account any relevant comments of the taxpayer with which the inspector agrees). Thereafter, the taxpayer has a year within which to lodge an appeal with the Regional Director of Taxes. The decision of the Regional Director of Taxes may be appealed and litigated. In a number of circumstances, the intervention of the courts can be sought prior to receiving the decision of the Regional Director of Taxes.
Pilot projects on horizontal monitoring are also in progress.
### Tax supplements
Tax supplements resulting from a tax audit will imply an effective tax cash out, without the possibility to offset these supplements against any tax deductions (with the exception of the current year DRD). These tax supplements will thus constitute a minimum tax base. This measure, however, only applies if tax penalties equal to or higher than 10% are effectively applied.
## Statute of limitations
Based on the Belgian income tax statute of limitations, the period during which the tax authorities are authorised to perform a tax audit and adjust the taxable basis is three years starting from the first day of the tax year, unless the company’s financial year does not correspond to the calendar year.
Further to a tax procedure reform in 2022, some extended investigation and assessment periods were introduced, but the following statutes of limitations remain unchanged:
  * The ordinary period of three years.
  * The period of five years for WHT.
  * Certain longer statutes of limitations that apply in some specific cases (e.g. foreseen in Art. 358 BITC).


In addition, as of tax year 2023, the investigation and assessment periods are extended to:
  * Four years in the event of failure to file a return or for late submission of a return.
  * Six years for certain cross-border cases*: 
    * Companies filing a local file or a country-by-country report.
    * Companies filing a form 275F for payments made to tax havens.
    * Companies that apply for an exemption, a waiver, or a reduction of WHTs based on a DTT or an EU Directive.
    * Companies that apply a foreign tax credit in their tax return.
    * When information is obtained from foreign authorities based on DAC6 and DAC7.
  * Ten years for so-called ‘complex’ tax returns in the following cases*: 
    * Presence of a hybrid mismatch.
    * Application of CFC rules.
    * Presence of a legal construction that is reportable for Cayman Tax purposes.
  * Ten years (instead of seven years) in cases of fraud. The tax authorities still have to notify the taxpayer of the intention to apply the extended period in case of suspicion of fraud. However, it is no longer required to state the precise indications of fraud at this stage.


* The new periods of six and ten years (for complex tax returns) cannot be used to examine certain disallowed expenses (including car costs, restaurant costs, or promotional gifts).
For social security contributions for employees, a statute of limitations of three years (ten years in case of fraud), is applicable. Social security contributions for employees are only due by the end of the month following the quarter to which the contributions are related. Hence, the statute of limitations will only start on the first day of the second month following the relevant quarter.
## Belgian ruling practice
Belgium has a long tradition of providing formal and informal rulings. Currently, a taxpayer may request an advance tax ruling on a wide range of subjects, including, but not limited to, CIT, individual tax, non-resident income tax, legal entity income tax, VAT, customs, and registration duties. The filing of the official ruling request is preceded by a prefiling meeting, which can be anonymous. The request should cover a ‘specific and concrete’ operation, which effectively is envisaged to be realised in the foreseeable future. The ruling should be filed before the transaction takes place. In practice, the ruling decision should be granted prior to the filing of the CIT return of the year of the transaction. A ruling is binding upon the Belgian tax authorities for a renewable period of a maximum of five years. Delivery of a requested ruling takes, on average, three months.
The Ruling Office is autonomous from the Belgian tax authorities and has the legal authority to issue decisions, which are, in principle, binding upon the Belgian tax authorities. The Ruling Office increasingly has adopted a constructive approach towards the taxpayer and is seen in the Belgian tax practice as a powerful insurance instrument in ascertaining the Belgian tax treatment of contemplated operations.
## Topics of focus for tax authorities
Topics of interest to Belgian tax authorities include:
  * WHT audits (cf. Danish CJEU cases regarding abuse and beneficial ownership).
  * Transactions with entities based in tax havens.
  * Participation exemptions / DRD regimes (including the so-called 'subject-to-tax' conditions).
  * Structures aimed at tax optimisation for the group.
  * Transfer pricing audits by the special transfer pricing investigation unit (deviating profit margins compared to prior years, material drop in operating profit or turnover, structurally loss-making entity, thin capitalisation, and others).
  * Professional WHT audits (exemptions, foreign employees, Belspo certificates).
  * The application of the copyrights regime.
  * The qualification of rental income as real estate income (versus professional income).
  * The reporting of foreign accounts and foreign real estate.
  * The application of the special expat tax regime and foreign travel days.
  * Tax exemption for days abroad.
  * The deductibility of interest payments (e.g. to tax haven companies; leveraged dividend payments/capital reductions).
  * Substance.
  * Tax-exempt provisions for risks and charges.
  * Companies with abnormal turnover.
  * Irregular use of carried forward tax losses.
  * 80%-limit regarding premiums for complementary pension.
  * Companies with foreign revenues.
  * Capital increases.
  * Exceptional costs.
  * Liquidation reserve.
  * Foreign tax credit.
  * Audit whether some legal entities (e.g. non-profit organisations) are rightfully subject to legal entity income tax or should be subject to CIT.
  * Special regimes in the CIT.
  * Sport sector and brokers.
  * CFCs ().
  * Cayman Tax ().




# Belgium
## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
A company is a resident of Belgium for tax purposes if it has its principal place of business or its seat of management in Belgium. The seat of management has been defined by Belgian case law as the place from where directing impulsions emanate or the place where the company's effective management and central administration abide, meaning the place where the corporate decision-making process actually takes place.
Although in company law the 'registered seat' theory has become the new general rule since the reform of Belgian company law in 2019, from a tax point of view, the 'real seat' theory remains applicable. Therefore, new definitions of 'companies', 'resident companies' (combined with a rebuttable presumption to avoid situations of double non-residence), and 'foreign companies' have been introduced in the BITC.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a Belgian establishment under Belgian domestic tax law corresponds, but is broader than, the definition of a PE under either the OECD Model Tax Convention or Belgium’s DTTs. Since the latter prevail over domestic law, Belgium generally cannot levy tax if a non-resident has a Belgian establishment that does not constitute a PE under the relevant DTT. Although Belgium would not be entitled to tax the profit attributable to the Belgian establishment in such a case, the foreign company should still abide by certain formal tax requirements (e.g. filing a non-resident tax return, responding to requests for information).

## Corporate - Deductions
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
As a general rule, expenses are tax deductible in Belgium if they are incurred in order to maintain or to increase taxable income, they are incurred or have accrued during the taxable period concerned, and evidence of the reality and the amount of such expenses is provided by the taxpayer.
## Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of an asset is tax deductible to the extent that it results from a devaluation of the asset, and the devaluation effectively occurred during the taxable period concerned. The depreciation methods that are accepted by Belgian tax law are the straight-line method (linear method) and, in the past, the double-declining balance method. In the latter case, the annual depreciation may not exceed 40% of the acquisition value. 
Depreciation rates are based on the expected lifetime of the assets concerned, which are normally agreed upon by the taxpayer with the tax authorities. However, for certain assets, rates are set by administrative instructions as follows:
Assets | Depreciation rate (%)  
---|---  
Commercial buildings | 3  
Industrial buildings | 5  
Machinery and equipment (depending on the type) | 20 or 33  
Rolling stock | 20  
Intangible fixed assets must be amortised over a period of at least five years for tax purposes (except R&D expenses, for which the minimum amortisation period is three years).
For the year of acquisition of an asset, only the proportionate share of an annual depreciation calculation can be accepted as depreciation for income tax purposes (in principle to be computed on a daily basis). The same rule applies for acquisition-related costs, such as registration duties and notary fees due upon a purchase of real estate, but SMEs can opt to fully deduct these costs in the year of the acquisition. 
## Goodwill
Belgian accounting and tax laws allow amortisation of goodwill arising at the occasion of an asset deal. For Belgian tax purposes, the amortisation period, which depends on the elements included in the goodwill, is a minimum of five years, and the straight-line method must be applied. According to the Minister of Finance, '_clientele_ ' (client lists) should be amortised over a period of 10 to 12 years. The aforesaid accounting and tax amortisation for goodwill is not available if tax-free mergers or de-mergers occur (i.e. they, among other things, follow the continuity principle from an accounting perspective).
## Start-up expenses
Incorporation costs, at the election of the taxpayer, may be deducted fully in the year of incorporation or can be depreciated over a maximum period of five years.
## Interest expenses
Interest expenses are, in principle, tax deductible insofar as thin capitalisation/30% EBITDA limits are respected (_see Thin capitalisation in the section_) and the interest is at an arm’s-length rate.
## Provisions and bad debt reserves
Provisions and bad debt reserves are tax deductible provided that:
  * they are set up to cover clearly identified losses and charges (i.e. not to cover 'general' risks) that have been rendered probable by events that took place during the taxable period concerned
  * they are booked at the end of the financial year in one or more separate accounts on the balance sheet
  * they are reported on a specific form enclosed with the tax return, and
  * they relate to losses and charges that are deductible for Belgian tax purposes.


Provisions for risks and charges are only deductible for tax purposes if:
  * they correspond to an existing and known obligation at year-end closing (in addition to the other already existing conditions), and
  * they result from any contractual, legal, or regulatory obligation (other than those resulting merely from the application of the law on accounting rules and annual accounts). This change does not apply to existing provisions created before tax year 2019.


## Charitable contributions
Charitable contributions may not be less than EUR 40 and may not exceed 5% of the total net income of the taxable period, with a maximum of EUR 500,000 to be tax deductible. The law includes an exhaustive list of gifts that are deductible, including gifts in cash to certain social, cultural, or scientific organisations.
## Car costs
### Current rules
As of 2020, the deductibility of car costs and fuel costs is calculated based on the following formula: 120 – (0.5 x coefficient x number of grams CO2/km), whereby the coefficient equals:
  * 1.00 for diesel cars.
  * 0.90 for natural gas cars (with less than 12 fiscal horsepower).
  * 0.95 for petrol cars and other fuel types (including diesel hybrid cars).


The maximum deductibility percentage is limited to 100% and the minimum amounts to 50% (or 40% if the grams CO2/km are at least 200 gm/km).
Special rules apply to plug-in hybrid cars, with a distinction as to whether they were bought or leased after 31 December 2017.
### Future rules
As of 2026 onwards, only zero-emission company cars will be able to benefit from a tax deduction. Zero-emission company cars purchased before 1 January 2027 will remain 100% tax deductible. For zero-emission cars purchased after this date, this percentage will be gradually reduced to 67.5% by 2031. For polluting cars (i.e. any car with a CO2-emission higher than 0g/100km) purchased before 1 July 2023, the current tax regime will remain unchanged. For polluting cars purchased after 1 July 2023, a cool-down period is foreseen whereby the deduction will be gradually reduced to zero by 2028.
As for the deduction of fuel costs, a maximum deduction of 50% for the costs related to fossil fuel will be introduced if the car is purchased or leased as from 2023. Electricity for powering the vehicle will continue to be tax deductible at 100%.
Investments in public charging stations made by companies during certain periods are incentivised by allowing an increased tax deduction:
  * investments made between 1 September 2021 and 31 March 2023: tax deduction of 200%;
  * investments made between 1 April 2023 and 31 August 2024: tax deduction of 150%.


## Taxes, fines, and penalties
The following taxes and penalties are not tax deductible in Belgium (non-exhaustive list):
  * Belgian resident and non-resident CIT, including advance tax payments, any surcharge imposed in case of insufficient advance tax payments, any interest for late payment of the CIT, and any Belgian movable WHT.
  * The secret commissions tax, as well as the secret commissions for which the secret commissions tax is applied.
  * Regional taxes and contributions, including penalties, increases, ancillary expenses, and interest for late payment (certain exceptions apply).
  * Any administrative and judicial fines or penalties.
  * The banking tax (for banks), the insurance tax (for insurers), and the net asset tax (for collective investment vehicles).
  * The tax on games and gambling and the tax on automatic amusement machines.


Immovable WHT (i.e. real estate tax) and foreign taxes, however, are considered as tax deductible.
## Disallowed expenses
The following expenses are not tax deductible in Belgium (this list is not exhaustive):
  * 31% of restaurant expenses.
  * 50% of representation expenses and business gifts (there are exceptions).
  * Advantages granted to employees for social reasons, with certain exceptions (e.g. hospitalisation insurance premiums, gifts of a small value).
  * Capital losses on shares (except upon liquidation, up to the amount of the loss of the paid-up capital of the liquidated company).
  * Brokerage, commissions, commercial discounts, or other payments allocated directly or indirectly to a person in the form of a Belgian public bribery.
  * 17% of the benefit in kind of company cars or 40% if the fuel costs are fully borne by the company (minimum taxable basis).


## Net operating losses
### Principle: Carried forward without limitation in time
Tax losses can, in principle, be carried forward without any limitation in time. However, a minimum tax base should be taken into account. There are no limits on certain deductions (such as DRD, innovation income deduction [IID], and the investment deduction). Other deductions may offset only 70% of the taxable amount exceeding EUR 1 million. These deductions include, amongst others, carried-forward losses. The remaining 30% will be fully taxable at the CIT rate (_see Minimum tax base in the section_).
### Change of control
If a change of control of a Belgian company takes place (e.g. if the shares of the company are transferred and along with them the majority of the voting rights), the amount of tax losses, investment deduction, NID carried forward, IID carried forward, and DRD carried forward available in that company (before the change of control) can no longer be offset against future profits unless the change can be justified by legitimate needs of a financial or economic nature in the hands of the loss realising company (i.e. evidence must be brought that the change is not purely tax driven). 
A ruling can be requested from the Belgian tax authorities to obtain upfront certainty on the Belgian tax treatment of the contemplated operation and to ensure the losses are not forfeited as a result of a change of control.
### Tax-free merger or (partial) de-merger
If a tax-free merger or (partial) de-merger takes place, Belgian tax law provides for a partial transfer/maintenance of the rollover tax losses of the absorbed/absorbing company. The carried forward tax losses of the companies involved are then reduced based on the proportionate net fiscal value of the company (before the restructuring) compared to the sum of the net fiscal values of both the merging entities (before the restructuring). The current limited deduction of prior-year losses in the framework of a tax-neutral reorganisation also applies to the carried forward dividends-received deduction. 
### Carryback
There is no tax loss carryback provision under Belgian tax law (except for the agriculture sector).
## Foreign PE losses
Foreign PE losses can only be deducted from the profits of the Belgian head office profits if certain conditions are fulfilled. As of 2020, the deduction has been limited to definite PE losses. In addition, the recapture rule only comes into play if the losses were set off in any taxable period against Belgian profits or against treaty-exempt profits.
## Payments to foreign affiliates
A Belgian company can claim a deduction for royalties, management service fees, and interest charges paid to foreign affiliates, provided such amounts are at arm's length. However, when such payments are made, either directly or indirectly, to a foreign affiliated person, entity, or PE that is not subject to tax or is subject to a tax regime that is notably more advantageous than the Belgian tax regime on such income, there is a reversal of the burden of proof. Such charges will be disallowed unless the Belgian company can prove that the transaction:
  * occurred with an entity subject to an effective income tax at least equal to half of the income tax that would be due if that entity were resident in Belgium, or
  * is part of an authentic transaction in the sense that it was carried out for valid business reasons reflecting economic reality.


Fees, commissions, etc. paid to beneficiaries located in foreign countries and not properly reported, will, in principle, be subject to the secret commissions tax.
### Payments to tax havens
Companies subject to Belgian CIT or Belgian non-resident CIT that make direct or indirect payments to recipients established in tax havens at the time the payment is made are obligated to declare them if they are equal to or exceed EUR 100,000 during the tax year. The reporting must be made on a special form to be attached to the (non-resident) CIT return.
In the event of non-reporting, the payments will be disallowed expenses for CIT purposes. Where the payments have been reported duly and timely, their tax deductibility will be subject to the ability of the taxpayer to prove that (i) said payments were made as part of genuine, proper transactions and (ii) they were not made to an entity under an artificial construction.
A tax haven is defined as a jurisdiction:
  * included on a list of states with no or a low level of taxation (e.g. a jurisdiction where the nominal corporate tax rate is less than 10%), provided for by royal decree
  * regarded by the OECD as not being cooperative concerning transparency and international exchange of information (EoI) (i.e. on the OECD ‘black list’ of non-compliant states and, as of tax year 2022, the partially compliant states for payments made as of 1 January 2021), or
  * included in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions.


The reporting concerns direct or indirect to payments made to:
  * persons or PEs situated or located in a tax haven
  * bank accounts managed or held by one of these recipients or PEs, and
  * bank accounts managed or held through credit institutions (or their PE) located in one of those states.




# Belgium
## Corporate - Group taxation
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Belgium applies a tax consolidation mechanism with respect to corporate tax. Under this tax consolidation regime, which is also known as the 'group contribution' regime, Belgian companies (and Belgian PEs of foreign companies) may compensate taxable profits with current year tax losses if certain conditions are fulfilled, such as, amongst others:
  * A 90% direct shareholding between the group companies (or via a common parent company) is required, limiting the scope to the parent, subsidiary, and sister companies and their Belgian PEs.
  * The measure is limited to group companies that have been affiliated for at least the last five successive financial years.
  * Some companies, such as investment companies and regulated real estate companies, are excluded.


The group companies must compensate each other for the tax burden of the group contribution; because of which, the tax consolidation is financially neutral on a group level. Transferred taxable profits can only be offset against current-year tax losses and not against carried forward tax losses that have been generated in the past. The scope of the tax consolidation regime is limited to certain qualifying companies and subject to various conditions. To benefit from the tax consolidation regime, the group companies concerned have to conclude a so-called 'group contribution agreement' that meets several conditions.
## Transfer pricing
The arm's-length principle is formally codified in the Belgian Income Tax Code (BITC). A Belgian circular of 25 February 2020 provides an overview of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations.
In addition, the tax authorities can make use of other, more general, provisions in the BITC to assess the arm’s-length nature of transfer prices (e.g. the general rules on the deductibility of business expenses). The BITC contains provisions that tackle artificial inbound or outbound profit shifting. These are the so-called provisions on abnormal or gratuitous benefits.
If a Belgian tax resident company grants an abnormal or gratuitous benefit, the benefit should be added back to the taxable income as a disallowed expense unless the benefit was considered to determine the taxable basis of the beneficiary. Even if the abnormal or gratuitous benefit was included in the taxable basis of the beneficiary, the tax deductibility of the related expenses can still be denied in the hands of the grantor. Notwithstanding the above exception, the abnormal or gratuitous benefit should be added back to the taxable income when the benefit is being granted to a non-resident affiliated company. Such granted abnormal or gratuitous benefits can be offset against any tax-deductible items (e.g. tax losses carried forward, NID).
If a Belgian tax resident company receives an abnormal or gratuitous benefit, and to the extent that such benefit is received from a related company, the benefit received cannot be offset by the Belgian company against its current year or carried forward tax losses or other tax deductions. According to the position of the tax authorities (by the Minister of Finance), the taxable basis of a Belgian company equals at least the amount of the benefit received. This position has been confirmed by the Supreme Court.
Belgium has a special transfer pricing investigation unit with a mission to (i) build up and share transfer pricing expertise and (ii) carry out in-depth transfer pricing audits of multinationals present in Belgium through a subsidiary or PE. The number of transfer pricing audits being initiated in Belgium has increased significantly.
Belgian tax law has introduced specific transfer pricing documentation requirements. These requirements are based on Action 13 of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project.
Belgian tax law requires a three-tier documentation approach as provided under BEPS Action 13: Master File, Local File, and Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting. According to these documentation requirements, Belgian entities of a multinational group that exceed one of the following criteria:
  * operational and financial revenue of at least EUR 50 million (excluding non-recurring revenue)
  * balance sheet total of EUR 1 billion, or
  * annual average number of employees of 100 full-time equivalents


need to submit to the tax authorities a master file and a local file (the detailed form that is part of the local file only when at least one of the business units of the entity has realised intra-group cross-border transactions of more than EUR 1 million).
Belgian ultimate parent entities of a multinational group with a gross consolidated group revenue of at least EUR 750 million should file a CbC report. Under certain conditions, the Belgian entity that is not the ultimate parent entity of the multinational group may be required to file the CbC report directly with the Belgian tax authorities.
The master file and CbC report should be filed no later than 12 months after the last day of the reporting period concerning the multinational group. The local file, however, should be filed with the tax return concerned.
There are also specific transfer pricing documentation penalties, ranging from EUR 1,250 to EUR 25,000.
Advance pricing agreements (APAs) can be concluded (unilaterally, bilaterally, and multilaterally) via which the taxpayer can obtain upfront certainty.
## Thin capitalisation
### Old thin capitalisation rule (until tax year 2019 with grandfathering)
Belgian tax law provides for a general thin capitalisation rule (5:1 debt-equity ratio) according to which interest payments or attributions in excess of a 5:1 debt-equity ratio are not tax deductible.
For the purposes of the thin capitalisation rule, equity is defined as the sum of the taxed reserves at the beginning of the taxable period and the paid-up capital at the end of the taxable period.
For the purposes of the thin capitalisation rule, debt is defined as:
  * all loans, whereby the beneficial owner is not subject to income taxes, or, with regard to the interest income, is subject to a tax regime that is substantially more advantageous than the Belgian tax regime, and
  * all intra-group loans.


Bonds and other publicly issued securities are excluded, as well as loans granted by financial institutions.
Interest payments or attributions in excess of the 5:1 ratio are not tax deductible. The thin capitalisation rule is not applicable to loans contracted by (movable) leasing companies and companies whose main activity consists of factoring or immovable leasing (within the financial sector).
In case the loans are guaranteed by a third party or in case loans are funded by a third party that partly or wholly bears the risk related to the loans, the third party is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the interest if the guarantee or the funding has tax avoidance as its main purpose.
To safeguard companies having a centralised treasury function in Belgium, a netting for thin capitalisation purposes is allowed at the level of the interest payments and interest income related to the centralised financing function/cash pool function.
The thin capitalisation rule existed until and including tax year 2019. As of tax year 2020 (financial years ending 31 December 2019 or later), the EBITDA-based rule applies.
However, the thin capitalisation rule remains applicable in case of (i) grandfathered loans (i.e. loans granted before 17 June 2016, in case no 'fundamental' modifications have been made) and (ii) interest paid to a beneficiary located in a tax haven.
### EBITDA-based rule (as of tax year 2020)
The EBITDA-based rule is in line with the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) I requirements. Exceeding borrowing costs are only tax deductible up to the highest of (i) 30% of the taxpayer’s fiscal EBITDA or (ii) EUR 3 million. The exceeding borrowing costs that could not be deducted in the current taxable period can be carried forward for an unlimited time. Furthermore, upon certain conditions, taxpayers belonging to the same group also have the possibility to transfer unused EBITDA capacity to other group companies.
A grandfathering clause applies for loans granted before 17 June 2016. However, the old thin capitalisation rule remains applicable for interest payments to tax havens.
## Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)
The Belgian CFC regime was introduced in 2017 as part of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). The first version of the CFC regime taxed non-distributed income arising from non-genuine arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage (transactional approach). Basically, this approach required that the significant people functions generating the CFC income were located in Belgium.
From tax year 2024, the CFC regime has been reformed based on an entity approach, as it now focuses on the taxation of passive income subject to low taxation abroad (defined as half of the taxation that would occur under the Belgian rules), unless the taxpayer can prove that sufficient substance is available locally.
A foreign company qualifies as a CFC if both the participation and the taxation condition are met:
  * The participation condition is met if the Belgian taxpayer, whether or not together with its ‘associated companies’ (as specifically defined), holds a participation of more than 50% of the voting rights, owns more than 50% of capital, or is entitled to receive more than 50% of the profits of that entity. A PE of a Belgian taxpayer is deemed to fulfil this condition.
  * The taxation condition is met if the foreign entity (or PE) is not subject to income tax or subject to income tax that is less than half of the CIT that would have been due if this foreign entity would be a Belgian taxpayer. Some 'tax havens' are deemed to fulfil the taxation condition, until proven otherwise. These tax havens are defined as a jurisdiction included on (i) the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions (_see Dividend income in the_ _section_) and (ii) a national list of jurisdictions where the nominal corporate tax rate is less than 10% (_see Payments to foreign affiliates in the_ _section_).


If the foreign entity (or PE) qualifies as a CFC, the amount of income/profit to be allocated to the Belgian taxpayer needs to be calculated/assessed according to Belgian accounting and tax rules (recalculation is thus necessary). The foreign profits are then allocated to the Belgian taxpayer taking into account the following parameters:
  * The profits must be limited in proportion to the part of the profits that is not distributed by the CFC.
  * The profits are limited in proportion to the CFC’s income that qualifies as passive income.
  * The profits are proportionally to be allocated based on the taxpayer’s direct controlling interest in the CFC.


For the additional taxable basis in Belgium, a tax credit of the foreign tax effectively paid would be available.
There are also some exceptions (‘safe harbours’) foreseen that, when applicable, would safeguard certain foreign income from taxation at the Belgian taxpayer’s level, more specifically when:
  * the Belgian taxpayer can provide evidence that sufficient substance (‘substantial economic activity’) is available in the CFC
  * less than 1/3 of the total income of the CFC qualifies as passive income, or


  * the CFC qualifies as a financial undertaking (subject to certain conditions).


From a tax compliance perspective, all entities qualifying as CFCs have to be reported in the Belgian CIT return.
### Circular letter of 13 December 2024
On 13 December 2024 the Belgian tax administration issued a circular regarding the CFC rule (Circular 2024/C/82). It elaborates quite extensively on the different aspects of the updated Belgian CFC rules, including the interpretation of the Belgian tax authorities on how taxpayers are expected to apply these rules. The key elements that are addressed by this circular letter are the following:
#### Participation Condition
The circular provides extensive clarification on the interpretation of the participation condition, including a number of examples. It confirms that the participation condition is only fulfilled if the Belgian taxpayer holds at least one share in the foreign entity, excluding ‘sister’ entities (and indirect subsidiaries) from qualifying as a CFC of the Belgian taxpayer.
#### Taxation Condition
For foreign entities within the EEA, local GAAP accounts do not need to be converted into Belgian GAAP, reducing the compliance burden for EEA-based entities held by a Belgian taxpayer. For entities outside the EEA, the circular letter explicitly states that a conversion to Belgian GAAP financials is required.
Certain formalities related to Belgian corporate income tax provisions may not be fulfilled by the foreign entity. In such cases, these provisions can still be considered for recalculating the deemed Belgian taxable base.
If a (Q)DMTT under Pillar 2 is levied in the jurisdiction of the foreign entity, it will not be considered an income tax for assessing the taxation condition under the Belgian CFC rules. This could have an impact on groups that are subject to the Pillar 2 rules.
The circular also provides additional clarifications on temporary and permanent differences (temporary differences can be excluded subject to certain conditions), the interplay with foreign fiscal consolidation regimes and interest limitation rules (a stand-alone entity approach is mentioned) and relevance of carried-forward losses/tax assets of the foreign entity.
Finally, it confirms that the Belgian CFC rules are not applied in ‘cascade’, meaning they do not need to be considered to determine the recalculated Belgian tax base of a foreign entity that holds (potential) CFCs.
#### Safe harbours
The circular letter focusses especially on the uncertainty linked to the substantial economic activity safe harbour and tries to nuance certain parts of the parliamentary works. As reiterated in the circular letter, the application of the substance safe harbour is a safe harbour that is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Some elements linked to this that have been further clarified in the circular:
Goods and services delivered in an intra-group context are not automatically excluded to determine the presence of a ‘substantial economic activity’.
Outsourced activities can also be considered in assessing whether a ‘substantial economic activity’ is deemed present.
Foreign holding companies can be part of the group’s economic activities, assuming the holding company actively participates in managing the enterprises it holds.

## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
PE profits are subject to the normal tax rate for Belgian corporations plus the possible surcharge for absence/insufficiency of advance payments (_see the section_). 
PE profits and capital gains on shares that do not meet the one-year holding period are subject to the standard CIT rate of 25% (or fully exempt for certain capital gains on qualifying shares if all conditions are met).
In general, the taxable basis is the difference between the profits actually realised and the tax-deductible costs actually incurred in the hands of the Belgian PE as determined from the separate set of accounts of the Belgian PE. No legal requirement exists to keep a separate set of accounts in the hands of the PE, unless there is a legal PE/branch in Belgium.
Should no separate set of accounts be kept, the taxable basis in the hands of the Belgian PE, in principle, can be determined on a lump-sum basis with minima per employee that vary between EUR 7,000 and EUR 24,000 (depending on the kind of business) and an absolute minimum of EUR 40,000 (to be indexed) in case of non or late declaration. Note that such determination of the taxable basis is often formalised in a written agreement with the local Belgian tax inspector without deviating from the tax law criteria as mentioned.

## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Foreign tax credits (FTCs)
Unilateral relief from double taxation of foreign-source income may be provided in the form of an exemption, credit, or tax reduction, depending on the type of income. Where taxable, foreign income is subject to tax only on its net amount (i.e. after deduction of expenses and foreign taxes).
### Dividend income FTC
Generally, no FTC is available for foreign dividends.
### Royalty income FTC
Unless a more advantageous provision (e.g. a tax sparing provision) would apply based on a DTT concluded by Belgium (_see the treaty list in the section_), an FTC is granted under Belgian tax law with respect to foreign royalty income, provided that this income has effectively been subject to taxation in its source country. This FTC is calculated by multiplying the net frontier amount (i.e. after deduction of foreign WHT) by a fraction of which the numerator is equal to the foreign WHT that was actually withheld expressed as a percentage of the income to which such tax relates and limited to 15% and the denominator is equal to 100 less the numerator. The FTC is, in principle, included in the taxable basis of the recipient company and is only creditable against Belgian income tax to the extent that said foreign income is included in the taxable basis of the Belgian company. As regards innovation income benefitting from the IID, the FTC can only be credited against the tax due on said innovation income. Excess FTC, if any, is not refundable and cannot be carried forward.
### Interest income FTC
Unless a more advantageous provision (e.g. a tax sparing provision) would apply based on a DTT concluded by Belgium (_see the treaty list in the section_), the Belgian beneficiary of foreign interest income is entitled to an FTC under Belgian tax law, provided that this income effectively has been subject to taxation in its source country. This FTC is calculated by multiplying the net frontier amount (i.e. after deduction of foreign WHT) by a fraction of which the numerator is equal to the foreign WHT that was actually withheld expressed as a percentage of the income to which such tax relates and limited to 15% and the denominator is equal to 100 less the numerator and adjusted with a ratio taking into account the financial leverage. The FTC is, in principle, included in the taxable base of the Belgian lender to the extent the FTC can be effectively used. It is creditable against the CIT due but is not refundable in case of excess, neither can it be carried forward.
## Investment deductions
The investment deduction has been revised by the Law of 12 May 2024 on various tax provisions, as published in the Official Gazette on 29 May 2024. This law implements major changes to the investment deduction regime.
### Former regime: investments made before 2025
The investment deduction is a deduction from the tax base in addition to the normal tax depreciation on, amongst others, qualifying patents, environmentally friendly R&D investments, and energy-saving investments.
A company can benefit from a one-off investment deduction for investments made during the taxable period linked to tax year 2025 until 31 December 2024. Please find below an overview of the percentages that apply for companies:
  * Patents, environmentally friendly investments for research and development, energy-saving investments, and smoke extraction or ventilation systems in catering establishments: 15.5%.
  * Zero-carbon trucks, refuelling infrastructure for blue, green, or turquoise hydrogen, and electric charging infrastructure for zero-carbon trucks:
    * Assets obtained or established between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023: 37%.
    * Assets obtained or established between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2024: 31.5%.
  * Investments to encourage the reuse of packaging for drinks and industrial products: 3%.
  * Investments in seagoing vessels by companies that derive profits exclusively from maritime shipping: 30%.
  * In the hands of SMEs (as referred to in Article 2, §1, 5°, c)bis of the BITC), the following investments:
    * Digital investments: 15.5%.
    * Investments in security: 22.5%.
    * Other than any of the aforementioned investments: 8%.


Taxpayers may opt to spread a 22.5% investment deduction over the amortisation period of fixed assets that promote research and development of new, environmentally friendly products and technologies.
If there are insufficient or no taxable profits, the investment deduction can be carried forward, but certain restrictions apply as to the maximum amount of investment deduction carried forward that is tax deductible in a given year. The carryforward of the above-mentioned ordinary one-time investment deduction is also limited in time.
Under certain conditions, the investment deduction carried forward can be lost after a change of ownership (_see Net operating losses in the section_). Note that the investment deduction for patents and R&D cannot be combined with the tax credit for patents and R&D.
In principle, only development costs can be activated; not costs of research.
### New regime: investments made as of 2025
The new regime is organised around three 'tracks':
  * The general track: Ordinary investment deduction (10% or 20% [qualifying digital investments, Royal Decree still to be published]). This is only applicable to individuals and SMEs.
  * The targeted track: An increased ’thematic‘ investment deduction (replacing the specific categories of qualifying investments) (40% [SME] or 30% [non-SME]). A list of eligible investments for this investment deduction are published by the Royal Decree of 20 December 2024 (Official Gazette of 31 December 2024) and will be reviewed/updated periodically. The increased thematic deduction will only be applicable to fixed assets for which no regional aid is requested (exceptions to be determined by the King).
  * The technology track: The so-called 'technology‘ deduction applies in relation to qualifying investments in patents and fixed assets that are used to support research and development of new products and future-oriented technologies that have no impact on the environment or that aim to minimise the negative impact on the environment of existing products and technologies (13.5% [one-off] or 20.5% [spread, not applicable to patents]). Taxpayers could opt to apply a tax credit for this category of investments.


The law provides for fixed investment deduction rates and will no longer be subject to the yearly indexation mechanism.
A taxpayer can only choose one of the above-mentioned types of investment deduction per fixed asset.
The general conditions to benefit from the investment deduction remain the same.
The new regime, as well as the correction related to the (partial) professional WHT exemption regime to determine the investment deduction basis, will be applicable for investments made as of 1 January 2025.
## Patents and R&D tax credit
As an alternative for the above investment deduction for patents and R&D, a company may opt for a tax credit for which the advantage corresponds to the advantage of the investment deduction, multiplied by the normal CIT rate of 25%. The investment deduction implies a deduction of the taxable basis, while the tax credit is a reduction of the tax due. A key advantage of the tax credit for patents and R&D is that it is refundable if it has not been deducted for five subsequent tax years.
As of tax year 2025, taxpayers can choose either to fully credit the tax credit for R&D against CIT or to carry it forward according to the rules specified in the law.
## Reduced wage WHT for qualifying R&D
A partial wage withholding tax (WHT) exemption for R&D activities executed in Belgium is available to companies in Belgium. This exemption can be applied by companies if the following (cumulative) conditions are met: the applicant must execute R&D activities, the R&D projects must be notified with Belspo prior to starting their execution, and the employees need to be in the possession of a qualifying degree (PhD, master’s, or bachelor’s degree in [applied] sciences, engineering, etc.). Since mid-2023, an additional requirement was introduced by the legislator. It is today mandatory for applicants of the measure to prove they have instored fitting internal processes regarding the application of the exemption. The requirements of said internal processes have, however, not been specified.
The measure allows a maximum of 80% of the wage WHT to be exempted on behalf of the employees for whom the aforementioned conditions are met. However, the time spent on R&D activities (indicated by a percentage of the total working time of the employee) should be considered when determining the maximum applicable exemption of 80%. The exemption can only be applied for those employees that are included on the Belgian payroll and for whom the applicant is paying wage WHTs to the Belgian treasury. One should note that, contrary to the past, the benefit obtained from the application of the partial wage WHT exemption cannot be applied in combination with the R&D tax credit for the same expenses.
Content wise, a project or program can be considered as R&D if it falls within the scope of the definition of scientific research as foreseen by the Belgian legislator. A binding advice with regards to the R&D activities can be obtained with Belspo. However, in practice and contrary to the past, we see that Belspo only provides binding advice in particular situations.
Particular attention should be brought to the evolving regulatory landscape with regards to the measure. Today, it has become even more important to ensure the R&D activities are notified in the Belspo portal prior to the application of the exemption by the applicant under penalty of nullity of the applied exemption for the full duration of the particular R&D activities. Towards the future, the legislator has promised to foresee more legal certainty to applicants. However, the modalities of said legal certainty and what these modalities will entail, have not yet been defined.
## Innovation income deduction (IID)
The IID is based on Action Point 5 of the OECD BEPS Action Plan (applying the so-called ‘modified’ nexus approach) and replaces the (previous) Belgian patent income deduction (PID) regime, which was grandfathered for five years (until 30 June 2021).
The qualifying patent/innovation income is calculated on a net basis. The percentage of this deduction is raised from 80% under the (old) PID regime to 85% under the IID regime, resulting in an effective tax rate of 3.75% as of tax year 2021 over the lifetime of the intellectual property (IP).
### Qualifying intellectual property (IP)
The IID can apply to income derived from the following IP of which the company or branch has the full ownership, co-ownership, usufruct, or license of or right to use:
  * Patents and supplementary protection certificates that have not been used for the sale of goods or services to independent parties before 1 January 2007.
  * Breeders’ rights requested or acquired as of 1 July 2016.
  * Orphan drugs, i.e. a drug to treat rare diseases, (limited to first ten years) requested or acquired as of 1 July 2016.
  * Data and market exclusivity granted by the competent authorities after 30 June 2016 (e.g. market exclusivity for orphan drugs or data exclusivity for reports with respect to pesticides, clinical studies of generic or animal drugs).
  * IP of copyrighted software resulting from a research or development project as defined for the purposes of the partial exemption of wage WHT for R&D and that has not yet generated income before 1 July 2016.


Under the IID regime, the benefit is available as of the date the patent is requested (and provided that the patent is actually granted afterwards).
### Innovation income
Without making any restrictions to SMEs, the following income is considered as derived from the above qualifying IP in so far as the remuneration is included in the Belgian taxable result of the Belgian company or branch concerned:
  * License fees.
  * IP income embedded in the sales price of own manufactured products for which a third party would be willing to pay a license (so-called ‘embedded’ royalties).
  * IP income derived from process innovation.
  * Remunerations on the basis of a court/arbitral decision, an amicable settlement, or an insurance settlement.


Furthermore, the proceeds from a transfer of qualifying IP are also in the scope of the deduction, subject to a reinvestment condition to be met within five years.
For the first taxable period during which the IID will be applied, the (net) innovation income should be decreased by the overall expenditure incurred during (preceding) taxable periods ending after 30 June 2016. Alternatively, one can opt to spread this recapture on a straight-line basis during a period of a maximum of seven years. In the case that the qualifying IP right terminates or is alienated before the end of this seven-year period, a correction will apply in order to limit the IID actually applied to the amount that would have been applied if no spread recapture had been opted for.
### Calculation of the IID
The IID is determined by multiplying the net innovation income by a fraction. This fraction represents the ratio between one’s own R&D activities and the outsourced R&D activities (towards related parties). As such, the taxable result of a Belgian company or branch is reduced by 85% of the total net innovation income after this fraction has been applied.
IID = ((qualifying expenditures + uplift) / overall expenditure)) x net innovation income x 85%
It is important to note that the ratio should be calculated on a net basis, implying that current year deducted overall expenditure should be deducted from the current year qualifying innovation income.
However, the law of 12 May 2024 provides that as of tax year 2025 taxpayers will have the option not to offset part or the full amount of IID against the taxable basis but to convert it into a non-refundable tax credit for innovation income. The law of 12 May 2024 provides that the tax credit can be carried forward and offset against CIT of (one of) the following taxable periods. Taxpayers will have the choice for each taxable period whether or not to apply this tax credit.
From 2026 onwards, the effect of the tax credit for innovation income will be evaluated on a yearly basis, paying special attention to the budgetary cost of the measure and Belgium’s competitive position compared to neighbouring countries.
Excess deduction that cannot be used due to insufficient taxable basis can be carried forward to be compensated with future taxable profits.
The qualifying expenditure may be uplifted by 30%, with a maximum of the overall expenditure. This means that the uplift may increase the qualifying expenditure but only to the extent that the taxpayer has non-qualifying expenditure. The purpose of this uplift is to ensure that the nexus approach does not penalise taxpayers excessively for acquiring IP or outsourcing R&D activities to related parties.

## Corporate - Withholding taxes
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
Domestic corporations and PEs of foreign corporations paying dividends, interest, royalties, service fees, and/or certain rentals are required to withhold tax.
Capital reductions decided by the general meeting as of 1 January 2018 will be deemed to derive proportionally from paid-up capital, taxed reserves (incorporated and non-incorporated into capital), and exempted reserves incorporated into the capital. The reduction of capital will be allocated to paid-up capital in the proportion of the paid-up capital in the total capital increased by certain reserves. The portion allocated to the reserves is deemed to be a dividend and will become subject to WHT (if applicable). Share premium distribution is submitted to the same system.
A uniform WHT rate of 30% is applicable on dividends, interest, and royalties. There are some exceptions.
Some WHT reductions/exemptions are foreseen under Belgian domestic tax law.
  * A WHT exemption is foreseen for the distribution of profits made by a Belgian subsidiary to an EU parent company if both the parent and subsidiary have a legal form that is mentioned in the Annex to the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive (taking into account the new Belgian company forms), if both are subject to CIT, and if the parent company holds, during an uninterrupted period of at least one year, a shareholding of at least 10% in the capital of the distributing company (implementation of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive). If the one-year holding requirement is not fulfilled at the time of distribution, the distributing company provisionally should withhold the amount of WHT due (but it does not have to pay the tax authorities). Once the one-year holding requirement is met, the provisionally withheld tax amount can be paid out to the parent company. If the one-year holding requirement eventually is not complied with (e.g. because the Belgian participation is disposed of by the parent company before the one-year holding requirement is met), then the Belgian company has to pay the amount provisionally withheld, increased by interest for late payment (4%), to the competent services of the Belgian tax authorities.
  * Also, a GAAR has been introduced into Belgian legislation. As a result, the WHT exemption will be denied whenever the dividends originate from legal acts or a whole of legal acts that are artificial (i.e. no valid business reasons that reflect economic reality) and merely in place to obtain the WHT exemption.
  * Further to the 'Tate & Lyle case' of the European Court of Justice dividends distributed by a Belgian company to non-resident minority corporate shareholders benefit from a WHT rate exemption provided certain conditions are met, among which are the following: 
    * The WHT exemption is only applicable to the extent that the Belgian WHT cannot be credited or is not refundable in the jurisdiction of the beneficiary.
    * Both the company distributing the dividends and the beneficiary of the dividends are subject to a taxation condition.
    * The beneficiary must be a non-resident corporate shareholder having a holding interest in the capital of the distributing company of less than 10% but with an acquisition value of at least EUR 2.5 million.
    * The holding interest must be held for an uninterrupted period of at least one year (in full ownership).
    * The shareholder must be a company located in the EEA or in a jurisdiction with which Belgium has concluded a DTT.
    * The shareholder must have a legal form as mentioned in the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive or a similar form.
  * The application of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive to dividend payments has been extended towards non-EU-resident companies. Dividends distributed towards a country that has concluded a tax treaty with Belgium containing a qualifying exchange of information clause can be exempt from WHT, subject to the same conditions as laid down in the Parent-Subsidiary Directive.


  * As of 1 January 2019, a WHT exemption has been introduced for Belgian resident individuals receiving shares in the framework of a 'spin-off' if certain conditions are met.


On top of the above exemptions, there are other dividend/interest exemptions/reductions implemented in Belgian tax law.
With respect to payments made to non-resident corporations or individuals, WHT exemptions and/or reductions can also be found in the DTTs concluded by Belgium.

Notes
  1. The treaty concluded with ex-Yugoslavia is still applicable to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia.
  2. Not applicable to Hong Kong.
  3. The treaty concluded with the former USSR is still applicable to Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
  4. It concerns an EU country or the treaty contains a qualifying exchange of information clause. Hence, the rate of 0% is applicable subject to the same conditions as invoked by the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (_see above_). Where multiple rates apply, the difference is generally based on the percentage of participation the recipient holds (directly) in the capital of the company paying the dividends.
  5. Under the Bilateral II agreement concluded between Belgium and Switzerland, a rate of 0% is applicable under certain conditions.
  6. With respect to EU countries, a WHT exemption is applicable, provided that the conditions laid down in the Interest & Royalty Directive are met (_see above_). Furthermore, note that some treaties contain an exemption for commercial debt claims or loans concluded with a bank or a governmental body.
  7. This table does not take into account most favoured nation clauses. 


The treaties that are currently in force are listed above. Based on the websites of the Belgian government, the following tax treaties/protocols are signed, modified, or under renegotiation (including some for the exchange of information clause): Botswana, Canada, Congo, France, India, Isle of Man, Macao, Malaysia, Moldova, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Tajikistan, Uganda, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.

## Cayman Tax
The ‘Cayman Tax’ was introduced as of 1 January 2015 in the BITC and was recently adjusted by the Program law of 22 December 2023. The regime introduces a tax transparency of certain legal arrangements that have been set up or that are being directly or indirectly held by Belgian private individual tax residents (and Belgian entities subject to legal entities income tax).
More precisely, the Cayman Tax targets the ‘founder’ of the legal arrangement in its broad sense. That concept includes, among others, any direct or indirect shareholder of an entity, whether or not the foreign entity is controlled by the Belgian founder and irrespective of any ownership threshold. Registered ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) qualify as founders of the structure for tax purposes.
The Cayman Tax provides for three distinct taxable events:
  * The receipt of income by a legal arrangement, which triggers a transparency taxation at the level of the founder based on a series of presumptions of income allocation.
  * The allocation or payment of any sum by a legal arrangement, which triggers a taxation as dividend income.
  * The deemed allocation or payment of income upon transfer events (including the founder moving its tax residency abroad), which also triggers a taxation as dividend income.


These three taxable events create a risk of double taxation, which is addressed by a reclassification of taxable dividends, under certain conditions, into exempted dividends.
Concerning the legal arrangement, a distinction is made between three categories:
  1. trusts and other structures without legal personality (type 1),
  2. foreign entities with legal personality that are subject to an effective tax rate of less than 15% calculated according to the rules of Belgian income tax law (type 2), and
  3. a type 1 or type 2 legal arrangement wrapped up in an agreement (type 3).


Regarding the type 2 legal arrangements, the tax applies to entities with a zero or lower than a 15% effective tax rate (according to the Belgian rules) or to those established in a country on blacklists (the EU list for non-cooperative jurisdictions or the Belgian list for countries with a low tax regime or zero tax regime). Further, the following entities fall in the scope of the Cayman Tax:
  * The so-called 'dedicated investment vehicles' (private UCIs and AIFs) that are held by one individual or several individuals who are related to each other, including SICAV-SIFs.
  * The so-called 'hybrid entities', i.e. legal structures that are not transparent for Belgian income tax purposes but that are tax transparent in the jurisdiction where they are established. However, hybrid entities established in the European Economic Area are excluded where the shareholder pays a minimum of 1% effective tax rate (according to the Belgian rules) on its share of the entity’s taxable income.
  * Entities with legal personality established in the European Economic Area that are not subject to income tax or that are subject to an effective income tax rate lower than 1% (according to Belgian rules). This 1% threshold will only be applicable to entities that do not fall in the scope of category 1 or 2 (priority rule).


The tax also does not apply to:
  * a legal arrangement carrying out a substantive economic activity (which cannot consist in the management of the private assets of the founder), supported by personnel, equipment, goods, and premises, and which is established in a state with an exchange of information agreement in place
  * income from the legal arrangement already taxed at the level of a Belgian company in application of the Belgian CFC rules or at the level of another founder in application of the Cayman Tax, and
  * largely held funds (as opposed to ‘dedicated investment vehicles’).


Besides taxation, founders are also obligated to report legal constructions in their annual income tax returns. This reporting must include detailed information on the legal arrangements involved, their administrators, and financial data, thereby enabling a precise tax audit at a later stage.
### New Circular Letter
After almost ten years of existence, the Belgian tax authorities finally issued on 13 December 2024 a first circular letter on the Cayman Tax (2024/C/79).
Tax practitioners who have been following the topic had anticipated this circular letter for some time. The Report of the Court of Auditors dated April 5, 2023, indeed provided an initial insight into the main positions of the Belgian tax authorities, which are now detailed in the circular letter under review. It was also indicated that the Minister of Finance had instructed the administration to prepare a circular to clarify the relationship between the Cayman Tax and Double Taxation Treaties (DTTs).
This circular letter does not address the practical difficulties generated by the Cayman Tax such as the so-called ‘Belgian recalculation’, but only aims at justifying the application of the Cayman Tax irrespective of whether the legal arrangement is resident in a country with which Belgium has concluded a DTT.
In short,
  * Supported by the existing position regarding the CFC rules in the OECD comments, the tax administration considers that, in principle, there is no issue with a Belgian taxpayer being taxed on income received by a foreign company with legal personality and resident in a country with a DTT. This is because it constitutes only economic double taxation, characterized by the taxation of two different persons on the same income. In contrast, DTTs primarily address international legal double taxation, i.e., the application of comparable taxes in two states on the same taxpayer, for the same taxable event, and for identical periods.
  * The tax administration then proceeds to add a whole series of ancillary elements, in light of the preceding hammering argument: 
    * DTTs provide no protection because, despite the fact that the Cayman Tax results in transparent taxation for the Belgian founder on income received by a foreign company classified as a legal arrangement, the foreign entity would nonetheless not be considered a transparent entity for DTT purposes.
    * For DTTs modified by the Multilateral Instrument, the new preamble and the new anti-abuse clause reinforce the interpretation that the provisions of the DTTs do not prevent the Cayman Tax from taking effect because these domestic provisions are intended to counteract tax evasion.
    * Finally, the safeguard clause included in certain DTTs confirms the general principle that the DTT does not restrict the right of a contracting state to tax its own residents.


The aforementioned Report of the Court of Auditors highlights that there are differing viewpoints in the doctrine and jurisprudence regarding the interaction between the Cayman Tax and the DTT.
## Transparency
### FATCA, CRS, and DAC2
#### Goals
FATCA (a United States [US] initiative: US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and CRS (an OECD initiative: Common Reporting Standard) aim to tackle offshore tax evasion via a shared objective of Automatic Exchange of Information (AEoI) in Tax Matters. Although CRS relies to a large extent on the FATCA system, there are noticeable differences, and interpretation can also substantially vary across different jurisdictions.
In a nutshell, financial institutions have to comply with due diligence and reporting obligations with respect to: (i) accounts held by specified US persons (FATCA) or reportable residents of other participating states (CRS) and (ii) accounts of certain non-financial entities qualifying as 'passive', which are controlled directly or indirectly by private individuals who are reportable persons. Financial institutions also have registration obligations under FATCA.
#### FATCA
The US Congress enacted FATCA in 2010. FATCA is applicable in other jurisdictions in either of the following situations:
  * A Model I Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) was signed by the relevant jurisdiction: Local financial institutions are obligated to report to the local tax authorities, who will then forward the information to their relevant foreign counterpart.
  * A Model II IGA was signed by the relevant jurisdiction: Financial institutions will directly report to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
  * The relevant jurisdiction has not concluded an IGA with the United States: FATCA is imposed unilaterally by the US Treasury Regulations released by the US Department of the Treasury and the IRS.


Belgium entered into a Model I IGA (Belgian IGA) with the US authorities on 23 April 2014, which was implemented into Belgian domestic law through the Act of 16 December 2015.
On 20 April 2015, the Belgian tax authorities published draft Belgian Guidance Notes on the Belgian IGA related to FATCA, which are subject to modifications, but can offer more insight on certain FATCA concepts.
Of particular interest, on 24 May 2023, the Contentious Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decided to prohibit the processing of data of accidental Belgian Americans by the Belgian tax administration (Decision 61/2023). On 21 June 2023, the Belgian tax administration decided to file an appeal and a request for suspension of the execution of such a decision.
On 22 December 2023, the Market Court nullified decision 61/2023. The case has been referred back to the Contentious Chamber, with a different composition, for a new reasoned decision on the merits. Therefore, the exchange of information provided for in the FATCA agreement will continue according to the specified terms and schedule, according to the Federal Public Service Finance.

#### CRS/DAC2
On 15 July 2015, the OECD approved its CRS on AEoI. This model has been endorsed by more than 120 countries so far (Belgium has been amongst the early adopters).
At the level of the European Union, the main legal framework for administrative cooperation, including exchange of information, is the Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC (DAC).
The Council Directive 2014/107/EU of 9 December 2014 (DAC2) integrates the CRS into the DAC, and the Belgian Act of 16 December 2015 implements DAC2 into domestic law.
On 14 March 2017, the Belgian tax authorities published the Belgian Guidance Notes on CRS (version 1), which contain valuable clarifications on the practical application of the CRS and DAC2. An update (version 2) was published on 28 August 2017.
The Royal Decree of 14 June 2017 implements the Act of 16 December 2015. Amongst other things, the Royal Decree lists ‘other reportable jurisdictions’ (non-EU states) based on the year during which the first CRS reporting is required.

### AEoI of advance cross-border tax rulings and APAs (DAC3)
Council Directive (EU) 2015/2376 of 8 December 2015 (DAC3) completes the DAC by requiring EU member states to automatically exchange a basic set of information on advance cross-border tax rulings ('rulings') and advance pricing arrangements ('APAs'), which are broadly defined.
From 1 January 2017, EU member states must exchange information twice a year (i.e. 'within three months following the end of the half of the calendar year during which the rulings or APAs have been issued, amended or renewed'). For rulings and APAs issued before 1 January 2017, a five-year look-back period applied.
The Act of 31 July 2017 implements DAC3 into domestic law and foresees a retroactive application by requesting the exchange of reportable rulings and APAs from 2012 till 2016. Before the entry into force of this Act, reportable rulings and APAs were in practice already exchanged to a certain extent (spontaneous exchange of information). DAC3 was also implemented at regional level.
### Country-by-country report (DAC4)
The Council Directive (EU) 2016/881 of 25 May 2016 (DAC4) completes the DAC by providing for the AEoI on the country-by-country report (CbCR).
The Act of 1 July 2016 and the Royal Decrees of 28 October 2016 have introduced the results of the OECD’s BEPS Action 13 in Belgian tax law (_see Transfer pricing in the section_). As a result, multinational groups with operations in Belgium should, under certain circumstances, submit a CbCR.
Such CbCR is then subject to AEoI to other EU member states pursuant the Act of 31 July 2017 implementing DAC4.
The Belgian tax administration has adopted a circular in the form of a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) regarding BEPS action 13 (Circular 2020/C/88).
The latest news on this topic is regularly published on the official website of the Belgian Federal Public Service FINANCE (in French and Dutch): 
### UBO register
#### Principles
The Act of 18 September 2017, modified a.o. by the Act of 8 February 2023, provides for the creation in Belgium of a centralised register of ultimate beneficial owners (UBO register) in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing (the so-called 'fourth' Anti-Money Laundering Directive).
Companies, (international) non-profit organisations, and foundations (amongst others) are required to collect and hold information on their beneficial owners. The register should contain at least their name, date of birth, nationality, and country of residence, as well as the nature and extent of the beneficial interest held. A UBO is defined as any private individual who directly or indirectly controls a company or another legal entity incorporated in Belgium, either by holding 25% of the shares / voting rights / ownership interest or otherwise. The weighted percentage of shares or voting rights that the indirect UBO holds or controls in the obligated entity and in each intermediary entity must be recorded. If no UBO can be identified, senior management of that entity will be considered to be the UBOs.
In addition to the initial registration of the UBOs, every change must be updated within the month and, moreover, the accuracy of the information must be confirmed annually. Not only the currently registered information is accessible, but also the complete history of the registration.
An entity is required to upload in the UBO-register any document that supports and demonstrates the adequacy, accuracy, and topicality of the registered data. This could be one of the following documents: a copy of the share register, the articles of association of the company, agreements relating to the transfer of shares, notarial deed, ID card or passport of the UBO, or any other document (legalised as originating from a third country). Only the competent authorities have access to these uploaded documents.
As per the Royal Decree of 30 July 2018, modified by the Royal Decree of 8 February 2023, the Belgian UBO register is accessible to the competent authorities, sanctioning authorities, other authorities authorised to identify or monitor the ultimate beneficial owners, eligible entities, and each natural person or legal entity demonstrating a legitimate interest or, in some cases, who submits a written request.
The new provisions particularly alter the procedure for consulting the UBO register, in order to comply with the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union dated 22 November 2022 (joined cases C-37/20, Luxembourg Business Registers and C-601/20, Sovim). From now on, the situations considered to have a legitimate interest are as follows:
  * The applicant is actively involved in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and related criminal activities.
  * The applicant is taking legal action to defend an interest related to the above activities.
  * The applicant will engage in economic relationships or transactions with an obligated entity and is involved in activities relevant to preventing or fighting money laundering, terrorist financing, and related criminal activities.


Every access to the register will be saved and can be traced during ten years. A beneficial owner can file a request to restrict the disclosure of the registered information for citizens and organisations, provided there is a high risk of fraud, abduction, extortion, intimidation, or when the beneficial owner is a minor or not legally competent.
#### Access by tax authorities and exchange of information (DAC5)
The Council Directive (EU) 2016/2258 of 6 December 2016 (DAC5) completes the DAC by providing access to anti-money-laundering information to tax authorities. The latter has been implemented into domestic law by the Act of 26 March 2018 and Royal Decree of 12 May 2019.
The Belgian tax authorities will communicate any information contained in the UBO register in the case of a request from a foreign tax administration.

### Exchange of information by 'intermediaries' on cross-border arrangements (DAC6)
Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 (DAC6) completes the DAC as regards mandatory AEoI in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements. It aims at strengthening tax transparency and deterring aggressive tax planning. DAC6 was implemented in Belgium by the Act of 20 December 2019 and the Royal Decree of 20 May 2020. Regional decrees were also adopted to that end. In June 2020, the Belgian tax authorities published a FAQ with further guidance on the application of the DAC6 rules.
These rules require disclosure to tax authorities of cross-border arrangements entered into by taxpayers that fall within certain broadly defined hallmarks. Some of the hallmarks, but not all of them, will only apply where objectively the main benefit, or one of the main benefits, of the arrangement is to obtain a tax advantage (so-called 'main benefit test'). DAC6 also mandates AEoI of disclosed information among EU member states and gives the EU Commission (partial) access to it.
When there is an intermediary (such as a tax advisor) based in an EU member state, that intermediary will be required to make the disclosure. If there is no intermediary required to report the transaction, the obligation will normally pass to the taxpayer. 
The Belgian implementation of DAC6 foresees that an intermediary bound by legal professional privilege (such as a lawyer or a registered tax advisor) has to inform the other intermediaries (if any) or the taxpayer that there is a reporting obligation due but that the actual reporting is prevented due to legal professional privilege rules. The legal professional privilege rules do not apply for reporting obligations related to so-called ‘marketable’ arrangements.
In Belgium, these specific rules are being challenged before the Constitutional Court (17 December 2020, 167-168/2020; 11 March 2021, 45-46/2021; 17 June 2021, 94-95/2021, 103/2022, 15 September 2022, 20 July 2023, 111/2023, 11 January 2024, 1-2-3-4/2024) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (Case C694/20, Orde van Vlaamse Balies and Others, 8 December 2022; Case C-623/22, Belgian Association of Tax Lawyers and Others, 29 July 2024).
  * To date, these cases have resulted in the annulment of certain legal provisions concerning (i) the obligation of intermediaries subject to legal professional privilege (lawyers, registered tax advisers, accountants, etc.) to issue periodic reports of marketable arrangements, (ii) the possibility for tax authorities to carry out tax audits with intermediaries subject to legal professional privilege, (iii) the retroactive character of the reporting obligation for arrangements whose first stage was implemented before the entry into force of the relevant regional legislations, and (iv) the obligation for the intermediary subject to a professional privilege to inform other intermediaries of their reporting obligations.
  * In Case C-623/22, Belgian Association of Tax Lawyers and Others, 29 July 2024, the CJEU clarified that waiver was established only with regard to lawyers and those who are comparable to lawyers in that they are entitled, under national law, to represent parties in legal proceedings (and not in respect of all professionals subject to an obligation of legal professional privilege under national law). The CJEU then concluded that the invalidity of the obligation to inform other intermediaries of their reporting obligations (as first interpreted by the CJEU in Case C694/20, Orde van Vlaamse Balies and Others, 8 December 2022) applies only to lawyers, and not to other professions authorised to provide legal representation. The Belgian Constitutional Court has yet to issue its definitive ruling on the matter.


Penalties ranging from EUR 1,250 to EUR 100,000 per infringement may, in principle, be applied by the tax authorities. The intentional character (or not) of the breach will be considered. Since the Act of 20 December 2024, if the infringement occurs independently of one's will, the minimum penalty is set at 0 EUR.
The normal reporting deadline of 30 days is fully applicable since February 2021. A periodic report on marketable arrangements is also due every three months.
The latest news on this topic is regularly published on the official website of the Belgian Federal Public Service FINANCE (in French and Dutch): 
### Reporting obligations for platform operators (DAC7)
Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 of 22 March 2021 (DAC7) completes the DAC as regards the AEoI for digital platform operators (both EU and non-EU platforms). DAC7 introduces specific obligations to collect, verify, and exchange information on their sellers with the tax authorities.
The scope of the Directive is very broad as the term platform covers 'any software, including a website or a part thereof and applications, including mobile applications, accessible by users and allowing sellers to be connected to other users for the purpose of carrying out a relevant activity, directly or indirectly, to such users. It also includes any arrangement for the collection and payment of a consideration in respect of a relevant activity'.
It should be noted that DAC7 aims to cover both private individuals and companies that are sellers of the platform. The mere fact of being registered on the platform during the reportable period is sufficient to qualify as a 'seller' if one of the activities covered by the Directive is carried out for consideration, such as:
  * the rental of immovable property, including both residential and commercial property, as well as any other immovable property and parking spaces
  * a 'personal service'
  * the sale of 'goods', and
  * the rental of any mode of transport.


Once the 'seller' falls into the scope of the Directive, some information will have to be communicated to the tax authorities (e.g. the name and identity of the seller, the total consideration paid or credited to the seller).
In addition, the administrative cooperation between EU member states' tax administrations is also strengthened, including by providing a legal basis for 'joint audits'. Furthermore, active participation in tax investigations by foreign tax officials is made possible.
The Act of 21 December 2022 (amended by the Act of 22 December 2023 aiming to strengthen the oversight and enforcement of the law at the platform operator level and by the Act of 20 December 2024) and Royal Decree of 25 December 2023 implement DAC7 into domestic law. Regional decrees were also adopted to that end.
#### Belgian former reporting obligations 
As a precursor to DAC7, Belgium had already introduced certain reporting obligations for digital platform operators through the Act of 20 December 2020. This preliminary version of the DAC7 obligations was applicable as of 1 January 2021 until 31 March 2023.
The reporting obligations under the Belgian law applied to ‘digital co-operation platforms’ (non-defined term), both Belgian and foreign. The material scope of the Belgian reporting obligations was more limited compared to DAC7 as it was limited to personal services (provided by individuals only, irrespective of whether the services were provided in a professional context or not). Platform operators had to (i) inform their users on their legal (tax and social) obligations and provide these users with an overview of all transactions performed through the platform and (ii) report this information to the Belgian tax authorities. These obligations had to be fulfilled for the last time by 31 March of each year.
### Crypto-asset reporting framework, high-net-worth individuals, sanctions policy, and other changes (DAC8)
Council Directive (EU) 2023/2226 of 17 October 2023 (DAC8) again further modifies the DAC to provide for an AEoI regarding new means of payment and investment, such as crypto-assets and e-money. It is expected that such reporting will facilitate tax control of crypto-assets and e-money. The Directive also further strengthened the rules on administrative cooperation, in particular, regarding high-net-worth individuals (exchange of information about cross-border rulings), the use of the information exchanged (for purposes other than tax), exchange of information on non-custodial dividend income, and sanctions policy.
Member states are required to adopt and publish the necessary laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to comply with the Directive by 31 December 2025. These provisions should be applied from 1 January 2026. The Directive also sets additional deadlines for specific articles, with provisions to be adopted by 31 December 2027 and 31 December 2029, and to be applied from 1 January 2028 and 1 January 2030, respectively. The specific implementation and entry into force dates may vary between member states.
### Public Country-by-Country Reporting (Public CbCR) 
#### Directive of 24 November 2021
The Directive (EU) 2021/2101 of 24 November 2021 (the so-called 'Public CbCR' Directive) introduced specific European transparency rules and requires certain European and/or non-European multinational groups or standalone undertakings to publicly disclose certain financial data. More in particular, multinational enterprises or stand-alone undertakings with a total consolidated revenue of more than EUR 750 million over the last two consecutive financial years should make certain (tax) information public.
The Directive provides for a combination of aggregation and disaggregation of the information to be made public.
According to the Directive, the information must be disclosed on a disaggregated basis, that is, on a country-by-country basis, for every:
  * member state
  * jurisdiction that is mentioned on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions (the 'EU Blacklist') on the first of March, and
  * jurisdiction that is mentioned on the so-called 'EU Greylist' (i.e. the state of play document) if the country is on the list for two consecutive years (on the first of March).


Under the Directive, the information related to other jurisdictions may be disclosed on an aggregated basis.
The Public CbCR Directive entered into force on 21 December 2021.
#### Belgian Public CbCR Law and Royal Decree: Broad Implementation
The Public CbCR Directive has been implemented by Belgium into national legislation via the law of 8 January 2024 and the Royal decree of 18 April 2024.
In addition to member states and jurisdictions included in the EU black and grey lists, the Belgian implementation provides that the information of the report on income tax information should also be disaggregated for the following jurisdictions:
  * jurisdictions mentioned on the Belgian list of tax havens of Article 179 RD/BITC92 (list relating to payments to tax havens)
  * jurisdictions mentioned on the Belgian list of countries whose ordinary tax provisions are presumed to be significantly more advantageous than in Belgium for the application of the dividend-received deduction regime (Article 73/4quater RD/BITC92), and
  * jurisdictions rated by the global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes as non-compliant or only partially compliant.


The Belgian implementation does not specify the effective dates for the various lists related to Public CbCR. It defines a 'non-cooperative tax jurisdiction' as a tax jurisdiction listed in Annexes I and II of the Council conclusions on the revised EU list of non-cooperative countries and territories for tax purposes, updated annually in February and October, deviating from the directive’s specified timings.
The first Public CbCR is foreseen for financial years that start on or after 22 June 2024. The publication should take place within 12 months from the date of the balance sheet of the financial year in question.
### ATAD 3
On 22 December 2021, the European Commission released a new important proposal laying down rules to prevent the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (commonly referred to as ATAD 3 proposal).
The ATAD 3 proposal has as its objectives to (i) identify the so-called shell entities with no minimal substance and economic activity (based on a substance test), (ii) define common tax-related substance requirements for these entities operating within the European Union, and (iii) deny certain tax benefits and impose disclosure requirements and AEoI between EU member states. 
The ATAD 3 proposal stems from the European Commission's Communication on Business Taxation for the 21st Century, in which the European Commission pledged to tackle the abusive use of entities and arrangements that have no or little substance. ATAD 3 would apply to all undertakings that are considered tax resident and are eligible to receive a tax residency certificate in an EU member state, regardless of their legal form (e.g. including SMEs, partnerships that are deemed residents for tax purposes, trusts). Undertakings falling into either of the following categories would not be in scope of the Directive however:
  * Companies, the principal class of shares of which is listed on a recognised stock exchange.
  * Regulated financial undertakings, which include (among others) banks, alternative investment funds and UCITS, as well as their regulated management companies, pension funds, and insurance companies.
  * Undertakings that hold shares in operational businesses located in the same EU member state as the undertaking's beneficial owner(s) (as defined in the Directive).
  * Undertakings with holding activities that are resident for tax purposes in the same EU member state as the undertaking’s shareholder(s) or ultimate parent entity.
  * Undertakings with at least five full-time employees exclusively carrying out the income generating activities of the undertaking.

Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Inventory valuation
Belgian accounting law provides for the following four methods of inventory valuation: the method based on the individualisation of the price of each item, the method based on the weighted average prices, the last in first out (LIFO) method, and the first in first out (FIFO) method. All of these methods are accepted for tax purposes.
## Capital gains
Capital gains are subject to the normal CIT rate. For tax purposes, a capital gain is defined as the positive difference between the sale price less the costs related to the disposal of the asset and the original cost of the acquisition or investment less the depreciations and write-offs that have been deducted for tax purposes.
Capital gains realised on tangible fixed assets and intangible assets could be subject to a deferred and spread taxation regime, provided that certain conditions are met.
### Capital gains on shares
Net capital gains on shares are fully exempt provided that the subject-to-tax condition, the one-year holding period, and the participation condition are fulfilled. The conditions to benefit from the capital gains exemption are, as such, entirely aligned with the conditions to benefit from the DRD. Indeed, the participation condition implies a minimum participation threshold of at least 10% or an acquisition value of at least EUR 2.5 million in the share capital of the company concerned.
The tax rate amounts to 25% if either the subject-to-tax condition, the one-year holding period, or the participation condition is not met.
## Dividend income
Dividends received by a Belgian company are first included in its taxable basis on a gross basis when the dividends are received from a Belgian company or on a net basis (i.e. after deduction of the foreign WHT) when they are received from a foreign company.
Provided certain conditions are met, 100% of the dividend income can be offset by a DRD. 
### Dividends-received deduction (DRD)
A DRD of 100% of dividend income can be applied under certain conditions (_see below_). Any unused portion of the DRD from dividends received from a European Economic Area (EEA) subsidiary or a subsidiary from a country with which Belgium has concluded a DTT with a non‑discrimination clause on dividends can be carried forward to future tax years (taking into account the possible limitations introduced by the basket). The same also applies for dividends from Belgian subsidiaries.
The DRD is subject to a (i) minimum participation condition and (ii) taxation condition.
In addition, based on a rule against hybrid instruments, dividends received by the parent company will no longer be tax exempt whenever the distributed profit is tax deductible in the jurisdiction of the subsidiary (e.g. hybrid loans). Further, as a result of a general anti-abuse rule (GAAR), the DRD will be denied whenever the dividends originate from legal acts or a whole of legal acts that are artificial (i.e. no valid business reasons that reflect economic reality) and merely in place to obtain the DRD exemption.
### Minimum participation condition
According to the minimum participation condition, the recipient company must have, at the moment of attribution, a participation of at least 10% or an acquisition value of at least EUR 2.5 million in the capital of the distributing company. The beneficiary of the dividend must have been holding the full legal ownership of the underlying shares for at least one year prior to the dividend distribution or commit to hold it for a minimum of one year.
### Taxation condition
The taxation condition, in summary, means that the dividend income received must have been subject to tax at the level of the distributing company and its subsidiaries if the former redistributes dividends received.
The taxation condition is based on seven ‘exclusion’ rules and certain exceptions to these rules. Basically, the exclusion rules apply to the following:
  * Tax haven companies, which are companies that are not subject to Belgian CIT (or to a similar foreign tax) or that are established in a country where the common taxation system is notably more advantageous than in Belgium or in a jurisdiction which, at the end of the taxable period, is included in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions (currently: American Samoa, Anguilla, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, US Virgin Islands, Vanuatu). Countries in which the minimum level of (nominal or effective) taxation is below 15% qualify as tax havens for the application of the regime (a refutable list of tainted countries has been published). The common tax regimes applicable to companies residing in the European Union are, however, deemed not to be notably more advantageous than in Belgium.
  * Finance, treasury, or investment companies (as defined by the tax legislation) that, although are subject in their country of tax residency to a corporate tax similar to that of Belgium as mentioned in the item above, nevertheless benefit from a tax regime that deviates from common law.
  * A Belgian real estate investment trust or foreign regulated investment trust that benefits from a substantially more advantageous tax regime than the Belgian tax regime.
  * Offshore companies, which are companies receiving income (other than dividend income) that originates outside their country of tax residency and in these countries such income is subject to a separate taxation system that deviates substantially from the common taxation system.
  * Companies having PEs that benefit globally from a taxation system notably more advantageous than the Belgian non-resident corporate taxation system. This exclusion is deemed not applicable to EU companies with an EU PE.
  * Intermediary holding companies, which are companies (with the exception of investment companies) that redistribute dividend-received income, which on the basis of regulations mentioned under the items above would not qualify for the DRD for at least 90% of its amount in case of direct holding.
  * Companies that have deducted these dividends from their profit or are able to deduct these dividends from their profit.
  * Companies that distribute dividends who are associated with a legal act or a set of legal acts of which the tax administration has demonstrated that this act or set of acts is artificial and was set up with the main objective (or one of the main objectives) to claim the deduction on dividends (envisaged by the DRD law), to waive from the collection of WHTs on this type of income, or to claim any other advantage of Directive 2011/96/EU in another member state of the European Union.


While this is a summary of the exclusion rules, numerous exceptions to these exclusion rules exist and need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis.
### Bonus shares (stock dividends)
Distribution of bonus shares to shareholders in compensation for an increase of the share capital by incorporation of existing reserves is, in principle, tax free. The situation may be different if the shareholder has the choice between a cash or stock dividend.
## Interest, rents, and royalties
Interest that accrued, became receivable by, or was received by a company, and rents and royalties received by a company, are characterised as business profits and taxed at the general CIT rate of 25%. The income can be offset against available tax assets.
## Foreign income
A Belgian resident company is subject to CIT on its worldwide income and foreign-source profits that are not exempt from taxation by virtue of a DTT (_see the treaty list in the section_). This income is taxable at the normal CIT rate in Belgium (i.e. 25%).
A foreign tax credit may be available for foreign royalty income and foreign interest income. _See the section for more information_.
Undistributed income of subsidiaries, whether or not they are foreign, is subject to Belgian income tax in the hands of the Belgian corporate shareholder if certain conditions are met (_see Controlled foreign companies [CFCs] in the section_).


# Belgium
## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 10 February 2025
## Corporate income tax (CIT)
In general, the tax base for CIT purposes is determined on an accrual basis and consists of worldwide income less allowed deductions. The rules are equally applicable to companies and PEs. It is assumed that all income received by a company is, in principle, business income. The income tax base is based on the Belgian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial statements of the company.
### General rate
CIT is levied at a rate of 25%. This rate applies to both Belgian companies (subject to Belgian CIT) and Belgian permanent establishments (PEs) of foreign companies (subject to Belgian non-resident CIT).
Capital gains on qualifying shares realised when meeting all conditions are fully exempt, while non-qualifying shares are subject to the 25% rate.
### Reduced rate
SMEs (based on article 1:24 of the Code for Companies and Associations, and provided several other conditions are met) are able to benefit from a reduced rate of 20% on the first bracket of EUR 100,000 profit.
## Surcharge
A surcharge is due on the final CIT amount upon assessment. The surcharge can be avoided if sufficient advance tax payments are made (_see Payment of tax in the section for more information_). For tax year 2025 (financial years ending 31 December 2024 and later), the surcharge is 9%.
## Secret commissions tax
A special assessment of 100% is applicable to so-called ‘secret commissions’, which are any expenses of which the beneficiary is not identified properly by means of proper forms timely filed with the Belgian tax authorities. These expenses consist of:
  * Commission, brokerage, trade, or other rebates, occasional or non-occasional fees, bonuses, or benefits in kind forming professional income for the beneficiaries.
  * Remuneration or similar indemnities paid to personnel members or former personnel members of the paying company.
  * Lump-sum allowances granted to staff members as reimbursement of actual costs proper to the employer. Although the reporting was extended to variable allowances as well, the omission to draw up forms in this case can only be sanctioned with an administrative fine, not with the application of the secret commissions tax.
  * Copyrights and related rights income and the concession of these rights.


The secret commissions tax can be limited to 50% if certain conditions are met. In some cases, no secret commissions tax applies.
The special assessment is a non-deductible expense. As of 10 December 2022, secret commissions for which the special assessment is applied are also no longer tax deductible (subject to exceptions).
## Minimum tax base ('basket rule')
A minimum tax base applies for companies with a taxable profit that exceeds EUR 1 million via the limitation of certain deductions. Deductions outside the basket are fully deductible. Deductions within the basket can only be claimed up to the amount of 70% of the profits exceeding the EUR 1 million threshold. The remaining 30% is fully taxable at the CIT rate. The threshold of 70% was temporarily replaced by 40% as of tax year 2024, associated with a taxable period beginning, at the earliest, on 1 January 2023. It has become 70% again as of tax year 2025, linked to a taxable period starting, at the earliest, on 1 January 2024, considering the law transposing the Council Directive (COM/2021/823) on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups in the European Union (so-called ‘Pillar Two’) has entered into force.
The deductions within the basket are the deduction of tax losses carried forward, the dividends-received deduction (DRD) carried forward, the innovation income deduction carried forward, and the notional interest deduction (NID) (both carried forward and incremental NID before it was abolished). Other deductions are excluded from the basket and thus fully deductible (e.g. current year tax losses, current year dividends-received deduction, current year innovation income deduction, investment deduction [both current year and carried forward]).
## Taxable income of non-residents
Certain income attributed by a Belgian tax resident to a non-resident is taxable in Belgium. A paragraph in the BITC functions as a ‘catch all clause’ to tax certain payments made to a non-resident of Belgium.
The ‘catch all clause’ applies in case the following conditions are all met:
  * Revenues stem from ‘any provision of services’.
  * Revenues qualify as benefits or profit in the hands of the non-resident beneficiary.
  * The services are provided to an individual tax resident in Belgium in the framework of one’s business activity, a corporation, a taxpayer subject to the legal entities tax, or a Belgian establishment.
  * There are (in)direct links of interdependence between the foreign supplier and its Belgian client.
  * Such revenues are taxable in Belgium according to a double tax treaty (DTT) or, in the absence of any DTT, if the non-resident taxpayer does not provide evidence that income is actually taxed in the state where the taxpayer is resident.


Given the condition of ‘any direct or indirect links of interdependence’, provision of services between non-related parties should thus, in principle, remain out of scope.
The rate amounts to 25% on the gross fee paid (resulting in an effective tax rate of 12.5%, as a lump sum deduction of 50% as professional expenses is allowed).
## Local income taxes
No tax is levied on income at the regional or local level. Note that immovable assets (land, building, and possibly machinery and equipment) situated within the Belgian territory are, in principle, subject to an immovable WHT that is levied locally.

## Value-added tax (VAT)
### Scope of VAT
The following transactions are subject to VAT in Belgium if they are considered to take place in Belgium:
  * The supply of goods and services effected for consideration by a taxable person acting as such.
  * The acquisition of services for consideration from outside Belgium between taxable persons.
  * The importation of goods.
  * Intra-Community acquisition of goods for consideration by a taxable person acting as such or by a non-taxable legal person (including the transfer of assets).
  * The self-supply by a taxable person.


### Intra-Community supply and intra-Community acquisition
An intra-Community supply of goods is a supply of goods whereby the goods are moving from one EU member state to another EU member state. In the member state of departure of the goods, the goods can be, under certain conditions, VAT exempt. As a result, the intra-Community acquisition of the goods (i.e. the arrival of the goods in the other member state) will be taxable.
### Standard and other VAT rates
The standard VAT rate is 21%. This rate applies to all goods and services not qualifying for one of the reduced VAT rates.
The following supplies of goods and services have a 12% VAT rate:
  * Phytopharmaceutical products.
  * (Inner) tubes.
  * Certain combustible material.
  * Margarine.
  * Social housing (including private initiatives) and certain renovation works on immovable property.
  * Restaurant and catering services (excluding the provision of beverages).


The following supplies of goods and services have a 6% VAT rate:
  * Works on (certain) immovable property (with strict conditions).
  * Basic necessities, such as food and pharmaceuticals.
  * Distribution of water through pipelines.
  * Some printed materials and electronic publications.
  * Transport services of persons.
  * Hotels and camping.
  * Use of cultural, sporting, and entertainment venues.
  * Works of art, antiques, and collector's items.
  * Supplies of cars for the disabled, as well as equipment and accessories for such cars.
  * Supplies of certain devices for therapeutic use.
  * Contract farming.
  * Repair of bicycles, shoes and leather goods, clothing, and household linen.
  * Some housing for private use, for the disabled, and in the social sector.
  * Copyrights.
  * Concerts and exhibitions.
  * Some medical equipment.
  * Goods and services supplied by social organisations.
  * Demolition and reconstruction of buildings: 
    * Construction contracts concluded by natural persons for their own and unique home.
    * Construction contracts concluded by natural persons or legal entities who will rent out the new home within the framework of social policy under certain conditions.
    * Sales of the reconstructed residential buildings/houses under certain conditions up to 30 June 2025 (transitional measure)
  * Certain products intended for intimate hygienic protection.
  * Maintenance, repair, and rental of external defibrillators.
  * The supply of hair prostheses under certain conditions.
  * The supply of custom bras and bathing suits for external breast prostheses under certain conditions.
  * Electricity to households (temporarily from 1 March 2022 until 30 June 2023). The supply of electricity for non-business use will be subject to this rate as of 1 July 2023 under certain conditions.
  * Natural gas and heat via heating networks to households, businesses, and governments (temporarily from 1 April 2022 until 30 June 2023). The supply of natural gas used as heating fuel for non-business use and the supply of heat via heating networks to a customer who is a natural person will be subject to this rate as of 1 July 2023 under certain conditions.
  * Heat pumps (temporarily from 1 April 2022 until 31 December 2024).


The following supplies of goods and services are VAT exempt with credit (‘zero-rated’):
  * Exports and certain related services.
  * Intra-Community supplies of goods and certain related services.
  * Imports, intra-Community acquisitions, and local trades of goods within VAT warehouses or under special customs regimes.
  * Certain transactions on goods placed in a customs or VAT warehouse.
  * Cross-border passenger transportation by ship or aircraft.
  * Supplies to diplomats and international organisations.
  * Certain supplies of goods and services to certain vessels and aircraft mainly involved in international passenger transport.
  * Certain (digital) periodic publications like newspapers, journals, and magazines.
  * Supply of recovered goods or products.


The following supplies of goods and services are, under certain conditions, VAT exempt without credit:
  * Medical services with a therapeutic purpose.
  * Social services.
  * Education services.
  * Sport services.
  * Cultural services.
  * Banking services.
  * Interest charges.
  * Financial services (option to tax possible for paying and cashing services).
  * Insurance services.
  * Land and real estate sales.
  * Property leasing and letting (option to tax possible as of 1 January 2019).


It should be noted that specific conditions may apply to the above two categories.
### VAT grouping
Under a VAT group, independent legal persons are treated as one single taxable person for VAT purposes if they are closely linked financially, economically, and organisationally. Hence, for VAT purposes, all supplies of goods and services to or by the group members are deemed to be made to or by the group itself.
The application of a VAT group has, amongst others, the following consequences:
  * No issuance of 'inter-company' invoices between companies in the VAT group (however, internal documents will be required).
  * No charging of VAT between companies in the VAT group (avoiding VAT pre-financing).
  * No cascade of limitation of the right to deduct VAT when on charging costs to companies in the VAT group.
  * Head office abroad outside the VAT group will be seen as a third party and will trigger VAT on head office/PE services.
  * Mutual liability between VAT group members.
  * Filing of one VAT return for all companies in the VAT group.
  * Statistical reporting to NBB. The reporting frequency (e.g. annually or quarterly) depends on the annual turnover of the VAT group. Optionally, the VAT group representative can file the information on behalf of the members.


## Import duties
Goods coming from outside the European Union and imported into Belgium are subject to import duties. Import duties are calculated based on three main elements:
### Classification
All products are classified based on the rules laid down in the Combined Nomenclature (CN). All products traded in the world can be classified in accordance with the tariff nomenclature and the six General Rules of Interpretation (GIR). An import duty rate is linked to every commodity code and is based on TARIC level.
### Origin
Based on international trade agreements (i.e. bilateral), a preferential import duty rate (i.e. a lower import duty rate) may apply to products imported in the European Union in case the goods meet the applicable criteria in the country benefiting from the agreement. In addition, it should be determined if your goods are produced in the beneficiary countries eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the EU's Scheme of General System of Preferences (GSP) for developing countries.
Furthermore, non-preferential rules of origin are used to determine the country of origin of goods for the application of the most-favoured nation treatment but also for the implementation of a number of commercial policy measures, such as trade embargoes, safeguard measures, anti-dumping and countervailing duties, or tariff quotas.
### Valuation
The customs value is determined based on one of the six rules laid down in the Union Customs Code (UCC). The most commonly used rule to determine the customs value upon importation in the European Union is the ‘transaction value’ (i.e. Article 70 of the UCC).
These valuation rules are harmonised on a global level through Article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) valuation agreement.
Various economic customs regimes (i.e. bonded warehouse, inward processing procedure, outward processing procedure) are available, allowing optimisation schemes throughout the supply chain.
## Excise duties
Excise goods are divided into the following two groups:
  * Community excise products are defined as excise products at an EU-level and include the following product categories: (i) alcoholic beverages and ethyl alcohol, (ii) energy products and electricity, and (iii) manufactured tobacco. The goods can be sent from one member state to another member state for commercial purposes under (i) the duty paid arrangement via submission of an electronic simplified administrative document (e-SAD) via the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) or (ii) under the excise suspension arrangement via submission of an electronic administrative document (e-AD) via the EMCS.
  * National excise products are defined at the member state level, in which the member state has chosen to identify certain product categories as excise-sensitive goods. In Belgium, the national excise products are (i) non-alcoholic beverages, (ii) coffee and tea, and (iii), as of 1 January 2024, liquids for electronic cigarettes (e-liquids). National excise products have different licence, movement, and compliance requirements in comparison to the European excise products and are decided by the member state.


The European Union determined the threshold (with minimum and maximum rates) in which the EU member states have to define the applicable excise duty rate per product on a national basis. With respect to the national excise goods, every member state has the liberty to freely decide upon the national excise duty rates applicable.
## Property taxes
Immovable property is subject to an immovable WHT (also called ‘real estate tax’) due on a yearly basis to the region in which the property is located. This tax is calculated as a percentage of the so-called ‘cadastral income’ of the property (a kind of ‘deemed’ rental income). This deemed rental income should constitute the average normal net income of one year (based on rental incomes of similar properties in 1976). Since the cadastre has not been updated since 1976 and since this merely concerns a fictitious income, this 'deemed' rental income can only be considered as a presumed income, which generally will not match the actual income the immovable property could generate.
The tax rate depends on where the property is located (as it is a combination of regional, provincial, and communal tax).
Machinery and equipment can also be considered as immovable property if certain conditions are met (e.g. sustainable connection to the property although intrinsically being movable property). 
## Registration duties
Purchases and transfers of real estate located in Belgium, including buildings (except new buildings, which are subject to VAT as described above), are subject to registration duty at the rate of 12.5% (Brussels and Walloon Region) or 12% (Flemish region) of the higher of the transfer price or the fair market value. Various lower tax rates exist in the Flemish Region (i.e. reduced tax rate of 3% for the purchase of the family home, 2% as of 1 January 2025 [potentially reduced to 1% in case of radical energy renovations]) and in the Walloon Region (i.e. reduced tax rate of 3% for the purchase of the family home as of 1 January 2025).
If the purchase or transfer of land is subject to VAT, no registration duties will be charged on the purchase or transfer.
In principle, only a fixed fee of EUR 50 is due upon a capital contribution.
Note that registration duties are also due when concluding (long-term) lease agreements on land/buildings located in Belgium. The applicable tax rate in this respect is 5% as of 1 January 2024.
## Stamp duties
Stamp duties are due on transactions relating to public funds, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin, that are concluded or executed in Belgium (including when the order is given directly or indirectly to a foreign intermediary by a Belgian resident or a legal entity for the account of a seat or establishment thereof in Belgium), to the extent that a professional intermediary intervenes in these transactions. Exemptions for non-residents and others are available.
## Payroll taxes
In Belgium, there are no payroll taxes applicable other than those for social security contributions (_see below_) and income tax withholding.
## Social security contributions
### Contributions for employees and employers
The employers’ social security contributions in Belgium amount to 25%, to be calculated on uncapped income. This percentage consists of the base rate of the employers’ contribution (i.e. 19.88%) and the wage moderation (i.e. 5.12%).
On top of this base rate and wage moderation, additional general contributions should be calculated, namely the contributions to the Asbestos Fund, the Closure Fund, the sector-specific fund for subsistence, etc. The average employers’ contribution for white collar workers would thus best be estimated at 27.50%. However, deviations may occur depending on the specific sector. Note that contribution rates for blue collar workers are significantly higher and are highly dependent on the industry.
For low wages, a reduction on the employer social security contributions applies, next to specific target group reductions. Moreover, for certain types of employers, a structural reduction, combined with a low wage component, may apply, next to specific target group reductions.
The employees’ social security contributions are fixed at 13.07% and are also to be calculated on uncapped income. Employees with a monthly gross salary of +/- EUR 3,200 or less are entitled to an automatic reduction of the personal contributions (i.e. 'employment bonus'). This reduction is applied as a flat rate that decreases gradually based on the employee's gross monthly salary. The calculation of the employment bonus differentiates between low and very low wage categories.
When calculating the social security contributions for blue collar workers (both employees’ as well as employers’ contributions), the calculation should always be done on the basis of 108% of the normal gross salary.
Social security contributions are deductible in determining taxable income both for the employer (CIT) and for the employee (PIT).
Foreign employees working temporarily on the Belgian territory in the context of a secondment or on a more permanent basis in the context of a multistate employment may, in some cases, be exempt from Belgian social security contributions on the basis of any bilateral or multilateral totalisation agreement that Belgium may have concluded with the home country or if they are employed by a foreign legal entity.
### Contributions for self-employed workers
The social security contributions due by individuals working as sole traders or on a self-employed basis are calculated (and collected) in an entirely different manner.
The contributions amount to (amounts for 2024):
  * 20.5% of the income up to EUR 72,810.95; and
  * 14.16% of the income between EUR 72,810.95 and EUR 107,300.30.


No contributions are due on the income above EUR 107,300.30.
