  * Four years for those conducting operations in the customs regime and five years for registered taxpayers.
  * Seven years in other cases.


Limitation of actions and powers of the fiscal authority will be interrupted according to the following:
  * Determination of the tax by the fiscal authority counted from the following day the resolution is notified.
  * Notification of the resolution in which the fiscal authority confirms assessment, interests, penalties, or fines in liquid payable amounts, counted from the following day to the resolutionâ€™s notification.

Relapse in the lack of complete or partial payment from the taxpayer, as established in the Tax Code, will be considered as criminal tax fraud.
