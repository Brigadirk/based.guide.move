## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
Branches of foreign corporations are subject to the same tax rules as Venezuelan corporations. Inter-branch income and deductions must be eliminated. The positive difference between a branch's annual book and taxable income is deemed to be remitted to the branch's head office (branch profits tax). Such remittances are subject to the 34% flat dividend tax (see _Dividend tax in the section for more information_) regardless of whether there is an actual payment unless the branch can provide proof of reinvestment of its profits for a five-year period. If such proof is established, no deemed remittance is assumed.
A Venezuelan taxpayer has to recognise, annually on an accrual basis, income generated in a company or other legal entity it controls that is located in a jurisdiction with low fiscal taxation (JLFT). Further, investments in a JLFT must be declared to the SENIAT.
