## Corporate - Tax credits and incentives
Last reviewed - 23 December 2024
## Foreign tax credit
Foreign income tax paid on taxable foreign income may be offset by the payable Venezuelan tax, up to the proportion of Venezuelan payable tax related to foreign-source income. Taxpayers must keep documentation of foreign tax. No carryforward rules are provided for in domestic regulations.
## Other incentives
Customs duty incentives are also available, such as drawbacks on the import of materials used for exporting products. This may take the form of a tax refund certificate issued by the Ministry of Finance. The certificate is a negotiable bond and will be accepted by the Treasury Funds Office for payment of national taxes. Determination of the amount of the refund will take into account the import duties effectively paid at the time the materials used in the manufacture of the exported product were received in Venezuela. Note that this incentive is not currently being applied in practice.
