## Losses
If a loss is incurred by any person from any taxable business activity, this loss can be deducted from the profits of other business activities in the same tax period. If the loss reaches an amount that cannot be fully deducted, then its balance shall be carried forward to the next following tax period and then to successive periods after the tax period in which it was incurred.
As per the new income tax law, any accumulated losses can be carried forward up to five years.
