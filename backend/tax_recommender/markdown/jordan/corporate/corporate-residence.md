  * whose management head office or actual office is located in Jordan, or
  * which the government or any official or public institutions own more than 50% of its capital.

The transfer pricing regulations in Jordan have defined a PE as a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is carried on. In addition, a PE includes the following:
  * Place of management.
  * Branch.
  * Office.
  * Factory.
  * Workshop.
  * Mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.
