## Dividends paid
Dividends payable by a Jordan-incorporated and resident company to both resident and non-resident companies are exempt from WHT in Jordan under domestic income tax law (consideration should be given to income tax for Jordan resident companies). 
## Non-resident WHT
WHT at a rate of 10% and NC—with the rate depending on the industry of the service recipient—apply to any imported services provided by a non-resident legal entity.
## Resident WHT
A 5% WHT applies to services provided by resident natural persons or civil companies, including doctors, lawyers, engineers, auditors, consultants, insurance agents, brokers, arbitrators, financial intermediaries, and shipping agents.
Interest, deposit profits, and commissions paid by banks and financial companies in Jordan are subject to WHT at a rate of 5% for individuals and 7% for legal entities. These rates are considered final tax for non-resident legal and natural persons.
Exemptions: Interest, deposit profits, and commissions paid between banks or to entities specified in executive instructions are exempt from WHT.
