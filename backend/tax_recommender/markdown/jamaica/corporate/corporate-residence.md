## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 02 August 2024
A corporation, wherever incorporated, is resident in Jamaica if the central management and control of its business is exercised in Jamaica. Normally, this is the case if meetings of directors and shareholders are held in Jamaica and major policy decisions of the corporation are made in Jamaica.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
The definition of a PE in domestic law is similar in a number of respects to those contained in DTTs and is defined as a fixed place of business through which the business of a business organisation is carried on. Where a DTT applies, then the treaty definition of a PE will prevail.
