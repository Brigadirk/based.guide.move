  1. Substantial holdings refer to resident companies that hold 25% or more of the voting rights of the paying Jamaican resident company.
  2. Tax is withheld at the rate of 15% where a dividend is paid by a company resident in Jamaica to a resident individual shareholder, regardless of shareholding.
  3. Tax is deducted from interest paid to Jamaican residents if payment is made by a prescribed person.
  4. Provided the income is not effectively connected with a PE in Jamaica.
  5. Applies only to companies owning a substantial holding (percentage ownership as prescribed by the treaty).

WHT is also imposed at the rate of 15% on insurance premiums paid by Jamaican residents to non-residents (subject to certain exceptions and protection under a tax treaty). WHT of 3% is imposed on payments in respect of ‘specified services’ purchased locally (above a _de minimis_ amount of JMD 50,000 per invoice).WHT withheld should be available for offset against the payee’s income tax liability on the filing of returns.
