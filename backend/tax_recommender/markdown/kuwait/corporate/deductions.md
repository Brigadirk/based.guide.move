## Head office expenses/payments to foreign affiliates
The deduction of head office expenses (the overhead or the indirect expenses) is limited to 1.5% of the company's Kuwait revenue after deducting the subcontractors’ shares (if any).
The direct costs allocated by the head office (e.g. supply of goods, design and consultancy costs) are regulated as follows.
For costs of supply from outside Kuwait:
Supply from | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue  
---|---  
Head office | 85%  
Affiliated companies | 90%  
Third parties | 95%  
For design costs incurred outside Kuwait:
Work conducted by | Maximum allowable costs as a percentage of revenue  
---|---  
Head office | 75%  
Affiliated companies | 80%

Affiliated companies | 75%  
Third parties | 80%  
In case there is no separate revenue for consultancy, design, or supply work, although the nature of the contract requires the existence of such work, the following formula shall be applied:
Consultancy, design, or supply revenue = (consultancy, design, or supply costs / total direct costs) x contract revenue
