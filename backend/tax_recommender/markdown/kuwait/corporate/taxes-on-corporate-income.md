## Corporate - Taxes on corporate income
Last reviewed - 23 January 2025
Kuwait does not impose corporate income tax (CIT) on companies wholly owned by the nationals of Kuwait or other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). However, GCC companies with foreign ownership are subject to taxation to the extent of the foreign ownership. CIT is imposed only on the profits and capital gains of foreign 'corporate bodies' conducting business or trade in Kuwait, directly or through an agent.
Income earned from activities in Kuwait shall be considered subject to tax in Kuwait on the basis that it is Kuwait-sourced income. In cases where a contract involves the performance of work both inside and outside Kuwait, the entire revenue from the contract must be reported for tax in Kuwait, including the work carried out outside Kuwait. _Please refer to the section for more information on income that is subject to tax in Kuwait_.
The current CIT rate in Kuwait is a flat rate of 15%.
Foreign companies carrying on trade or business in the offshore area of the partitioned neutral zone under the control and administration of Saudi Arabia are only subject to tax in Kuwait on 50% of their taxable profit under the law.
_Please see the section for the description of the 5% tax retention requirement_.
