## Real estate capital gains
The government has implemented a tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI). It is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells a real estate property, as long as the property has increased in value between the date of acquisition and the date of sale. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% for the New Caledonian solidarity contribution (CCS), making it a total of 24%. There are a number of exemptions and specific rules for calculating the amount of the tax.
