## Corporate - Other taxes
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
## General consumption tax (TGC)
The TGC (_taxe Générale sur la consummation_) is a value-added tax (VAT)-like tax that is applied to the consumer prices of goods and services since 1 October 2018 in New Caledonia.
TGC is due on goods sold and services rendered in New Caledonia. There are four rates of TGC:
  * Reduced rate: 3%
  * Specific rate: 6%
  * Normal rate: 11% for all the operations that are not subject to another rate.
  * Higher rate: 22%


Supplies of goods outside New Caledonia and certain specific services invoiced to foreign clients are, in principle, exempt from TGC.
Business-to-business (B2B) suppliers of services are generally taxable at the location of the customer and not at the location of the supplier. For business-to-consumer (B2C) supplies of services, the place of taxation is generally where the supplier is established / where the services are realised.
Some transactions are TGC exempted, such as:
  * Exemptions of transactions for reasons of public interest.
  * Some transactions in relation with real property.
  * Some transactions subject to other taxation, such as insurance premiums tax, tax on financial operations, etc.


## Customs duties
Customs duties are levied on the import of goods.
In New Caledonia, these duties, called ‘ _ad valorem’_ , range from 0% (‘exempt’) to 20% maximum.
Goods originating from certain countries (‘preferential origin’) may also be exempt from customs duties. This is the case, in particular, for goods imported from metropolitan France, the European Union (EU), or the ‘ _Pays et territoires d’outre-mer’_ , provided that their origin is justified in accordance with the conditions laid down by the regulations.
## Excise taxes
The license fee (_droits de license_) applies to businesses and professions whose purpose is the production or sale, in any capacity, of distilled or fermented alcoholic beverages or of fermented hygienic drinks.
There is a tax on alcohol and tobacco applying to alcoholic beverages from local production and to products of the tobacco monopoly.
The domestic consumption tax on local products and manufacturing (_taxe sur la consummation intérieure_ or TCI) applies to alcoholic beverages and products based on alcohol of any origin and source harvested or manufactured in New Caledonia.
## Real estate tax
The real estate tax (_contribution foncière des propriétés bâties et non bâties_) is a tax established on the ownership of land and buildings that varies according to the municipalities, neighborhoods, and type of construction.
The property tax is due for the entire year, without the possibility of splitting, according to the situation existing on 1 January of the tax year, in the name of the owner, the usufructuary, the long-term leaseholder, or the construction leaseholder or similar. Therefore, in the case of a sale during the year, the tax established during the year of sale remains due by the seller.
The tax base depends on the type of land, building, properties and equipment. The applicable rates range between 8.40% for buildings and 0.7875% for unbuilt properties. The tax should be determine based on the reduction applicable and considering the taxation applied by municipalities and provinces.
Please note that:
  * A Municipal Development Tax (_Taxe communale d’aménagement_) is also applicable to the recipient of a building permit.
  * A tax of 0.3% could apply to deeds that are mortgage related (_taxe hypothécaire_).
  * A real estate security contribution (_contribution de sécurité immobilière_) of 0.075% generally applies for the transcription of deeds related to real estate.


## Registration duties
Registration fees (_droits d’enregistrement_), either fixed or proportional, are levied on certain legal transactions: sales of real estate, businesses, donations, inheritances, etc.
They allow to date precisely the formality of registration. The duties are calculated on the sum that represents the amount of the transaction. In case of sale, it is the sale price stipulated or the fair market value if it is higher than the price. For successions or donations, it is the fair market value.
### Transfer of goodwill
The transfer of goodwill is subject to a registration duty at a rate of 4% on the part of the transfer price that is higher than XPF 5 million. If the transfer price is under XPF 5 million, a fixed registration fee of XPF 7,000 is applicable.
### Transfers of shares
The transfer of shares is subject to registration duty at a rate of 1%, subject to a cap of XPF 500,000. 
### Transfer of interest or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares
The transfer of interests or quotas in legal entities whose capital is not divided into shares (e.g. _Société à responsabilité limitée_ [SARLs] or _Société en nom collectif_ [SNCs], which are a form of private limited liability corporate entity) is subject to a registration duty of 1% with no cap. A tax rebate is applied for each transferred security, equal to (XPF 5 million x the number of acquired securities) / the total number of securities.
### Transfer of shares in non-quoted real estate companies
The transfer of shares in non-quoted companies whose assets consist principally of immovable property (or rights related to such immovable property) is subject to a registration duty of 4% with no cap.
### Transfer of real estate
The sale of land and buildings is subject to registration duty at a rate of 4% on the transfer price. Some reduced rates and specific regimes exist.
### Other formalities
Registration duties are not due on the incorporation of a company, except when capital contributions consist in real estate properties or movable properties. 
Capital increases are subject to registration duties (ranging from XPF 25,000 to XPF 50,000 depending on the capital of the company).
## Stamp taxes
The stamp duty tax is levied on all papers intended for civil, administrative, and legal acts, and on documents that may be mentioned in the context of a judgment and provide evidence. It is also levied on all acts that have already borne the stamp and registration duties in France or abroad; it is only collected to the extent that there is a difference in the rate to be collected for the benefit of New Caledonia. Perception occurs cumulatively with the fixed and proportional fees for registration. The stamp duties are up to XPF 15,000.
## Capital gains taxes
The government has implemented a tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI). It is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells a real estate property, as long as the property has increased in value between the date of acquisition and the date of sale. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% the CCS, making it a total of 24%. There are a number of exemptions and specific rules for calculating the amount of the tax.
Capital gains and profits made by corporate entities, regardless of their form, established outside of New Caledonia or without a stable establishment or a head office in New Caledonia, are also subject to the PVI.
## Social security contributions
The New Caledonian social security system is composed of various schemes providing a wide range of benefits. This system includes social security basic coverage, unemployment benefits, complementary retirement plans, death/disability coverage, and complementary health coverage. The contributions are based on the remunerations, and monthly thresholds are applicable to determine the rate, which ranges from 0.2% to 11.67%.
Employers have to pay these social contributions notably to the CAFAT (_Caisse de compensation des prestations familiales, des accidents du travail et de prévoyance des travailleurs de Nouvelle-Calédonie_).
## Training contribution
A training contribution (_contribution des employeurs sur les salaires au titre de la formation professionnelle_) is due on wages at a 0.25% rate.
## Business licence duty
Taxation of the business license (_contribution des patentes_) is compulsory for any natural or legal person who undertakes in New Caledonia the exercise of a trade, an industry, or a profession, for their own account and for profit.
It is calculated annually depending on the type and characteristics of the professional activity and is made up of a fixed fee (composed of a fixed tariff and additional tariffs) and a proportional duty (based on customs). If a company carries out its activity through several establishments, it will have to pay as many licences as it has establishments.
## Insurance premiums tax (IPT)
Companies are required, before starting their operations, to provide the professional tax service or the business formalities center with a declaration of existence stating the nature of these operations.
Any agreement with an insurance company or with any other French or foreign insurer insuring a risk in New Caledonia is subject to IPT (_taxe sur les conventions d’assurance_). The tax rate is set at 7%. The tax is applicable on all the amounts paid to the insurer (premiums and its accessories). Some risks are exempted from IPT, such as life insurances or reinsurance contracts.
Please note that additional contributions should apply based on the French Tax Code.
