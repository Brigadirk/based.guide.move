## Real estate capital gains
The government has implemented a tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI). It is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells a real estate property, as long as the property has increased in value between the date of acquisition and the date of sale. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% for the New Caledonian solidarity contribution (CCS), making it a total of 24%. There are a number of exemptions and specific rules for calculating the amount of the tax.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
Individuals, whether New Caledonian or foreign nationals, who have their tax domicile in New Caledonia are generally subject to personal income tax (PIT) on worldwide income (unless provided otherwise by a tax treaty between France and New Caledonia). Individuals who are not domiciled in New Caledonia (non-residents) are generally subject to tax only on their income arising in New Caledonia.
## Personal income tax rates
### Resident individuals
Each category of income is combined and, after deduction of allowances, is taxed at progressive rates. Total income is split according to family status (i.e. 'the more children you have, the less tax you pay’). Under income-splitting rules, total taxable income is divided by the number of shares awarded to the taxpayer: generally one share for a single person, two shares for a married taxpayer without children, one share and a half for a widow with dependent children, half a share for each dependent child, and one full share for handicapped children or children studying abroad.
However, the tax saved from income splitting is generally limited to XPF 300,000.
For residents, progressive income tax rates are then applied as follows:
Taxable income (XPF) | Rate (%)  
---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 1,000,000 | 0  
1,000,000 | 1,800,000 | 4  
1,800,000 | 3,000,000 | 12  
3,000,000 | 4,500,000 | 25  
4,500,000 | 40  
Certain corrections must be made afterwards in order to determine the net tax liability. For instance, the tax credits must be applied as well as any foreign tax credits.
### Non-resident individuals
Generally, income derived by non-resident individuals is subject to a flat tax rate (_prélèvement forfaitaire_) of 25%. This tax applies to very broad types of revenues, notably employment and business or professional related income, pensions, investment income (unless subject to tax on financial incomes [IRVM]), royalties, and income from immovable property.
A taxpayer is allowed to claim for the application of the progressive tax rate (as for resident) if one is in position to demonstrate that the progressive PIT would have been less than 25%.
## Tax on financial incomes (IRVM)
The IRVM (_impôt sur le revenue des valeurs mobilières_) applies, at a theoretical rate of 11.5%, to the income distributed (or deemed distributed) by companies or entities subject to CIT in New Caledonia.
IRVM is due on all incomes distributed mentioned in Article Lp. 529 of local tax code (e.g. dividends, interest). Some entities are expressly exempted from IRVM.
## Income tax on debts, deposits, and guarantees (IRCDC)
The IRCDC (_impôt sur le revenue des créances, dépôt et cautionnements_) applies at 8% on interest, arrears, mortgage, privileged and unsecured debts having the characteristic of a money loan, cash guarantees, associates' current accounts, deposits of sums of money, on demand or with fixed maturity, whatever the depositary and whatever the use of the deposit (bonds, capitalisation contracts, etc.) There are exemptions provided by Art. Lp. 555 of the local tax code. 
## Caledonian solidarity contribution (CCS)
The CCS is applicable to various kinds of income. It applies on securities products for natural or legal persons subject to the IRVM, on savings products for those subject to the tax on income from debts, deposits, and guarantees (IRCDC), on gaming proceeds for those subject to the tax on gaming proceeds, and on private real estate capital gains for those subject to the tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI).
The CCS rates are as follows:
  * For earned income (_revenus d’activité_): 2% from 1 July 2022.
  * For replacement and solidarity income: 1.3% from 1 October 2021.
  * For income of assets: 4% from 1 January 2023.
  * For savings and investment products: 4% from 1 July 2022.
  * For gaming products: 4% from 1 July 2022.
  * For securities products: 4% from 1 July 2022.
  * For private real estate capital gains: 4% from 12 December 2023.

## Individual - Tax administration
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
## Taxable period
Generally, the New Caledonian tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
## Tax returns
In order to establish income tax, every person with taxable income subject to this tax is required to file and send a detailed declaration of their income and profits from the previous year and their family expenses to the individual or professional income tax office, according to the category of income declared, each year before 1 April.
This declaration is, if necessary, accompanied by various declarations provided for in terms of categorical income.
However, this deadline is extended to 30 April for taxpayers subject to the actual profit regime (_bénéfice réel_) provided for in articles 76, 78, Lp.82, and 105 of the tax code.
This deadline is extended to 30 June for taxpayers who do not have their tax domicile in New Caledonia.
The income declaration filed electronically must reach the administration by 30 June at the latest, according to a schedule and modalities set by a government decree.
## Payment of tax
Individuals must make two preliminary payments, each amounting to one-third of the total tax paid in the last fiscal year. These payments should be made by 31 March and 15 July of each fiscal year. Typically, any remaining tax owed is paid in October, which is when the tax authorities issue a payment notice.
## Tax audit process
The tax administration may conduct an audit of an individual's overall tax situation with respect to income tax. During this audit, the administration may check the consistency between, on the one hand, the income declared and, on the other hand, the taxpayer's assets, cash position, and lifestyle elements.
The audit of an individual's overall tax situation may not extend over a period longer than one year, counted from the receipt or delivery of the notice of review.
## Statute of limitations
For income tax, corporate tax, the solidarity tax on services, the tax on financial transactions, and the TGC, the tax administration's right of recovery is exercised until the end of the third year following the one for which the tax is due. For the solidarity tax on services, the tax on financial transactions, and the TGC, when the fiscal year does not correspond to the calendar year, the recovery period starts from the beginning of the first period over which the right of recovery applies in terms of income tax or corporate tax and ends on 31 December of the third year following the one in which this period ends.

## Individual - Residence
Last reviewed - 24 February 2025
Under domestic law, an individual is considered to be domiciled in New Caledonia if at least one of the following criteria is met:
  * The habitual abode of the person or family is in France or France is the principal place of sojourn.
  * Professional activities are carried out in New Caledonia.
  * New Caledonia is the centre of economic interests.


Under the bilateral tax treaty concluded with France, tax domicile is first determined under the law of the country that asserts the power to tax. If the individual is considered to be resident under the laws of both countries, the treaty provides 'tie-breaker' provisions to determine the country of residence. These tie-breaker tests include as criteria, in descending order, permanent home, personal and economic relations (centre of vital interests), and habitual abode.

The contributions are based on the remunerations, and monthly thresholds are applicable to determine the rate, which ranges from 0.2% to 11.67%.
## Capital gains taxes
Capital gains derived by individuals are generally not taxable. However, the New Caledonian government has recently implemented a taxation on capital gain deriving from real properties.
The tax on private real estate capital gains (PVI) is a tax due when an individual or a partnership (e.g. an SCI) sells real estate, as long as this property has experienced an increase in value between its date of acquisition and that of its transfer. This tax is 20% of the amount of the capital gain, to which must be added 4% of the CCS, or 24% in total. There are a number of exemptions and special rules for calculating the amount of tax.
## General consumption tax (TGC)
The TGC (_taxe Générale sur la consummation_) is a value-added tax (VAT)-like tax that is applied to the consumer prices of goods and services since 1 October 2018 in New Caledonia.
TGC is due on goods sold and services rendered in New Caledonia. There are four rates of TGC:
  * Reduced rate: 3%
  * Specific rate: 6%
  * Normal rate: 11% for all the operations that are not subject to another rate.
  * Higher rate: 22%


Supplies of goods outside New Caledonia and certain specific services invoiced to foreign clients are, in principle, exempt from TGC.
Some transactions are TGC exempted, such as:
  * Exemptions of transactions for reasons of public interest.
  * Some transactions in relation with real property
  * Some transactions subject to other taxation, such as insurance premiums tax, tax on financial operations, etc.


## Net wealth/worth taxes
There is no net wealth tax.
## Inheritance, estate, and gift taxes
New Caledonian inheritance or gift tax may be due by beneficiaries of gifts or inheritance. If the deceased or the donor is a tax resident of New Caledonia, tax will be due in New Caldonia on worldwide assets transmitted. If the deceased or donor is not a tax resident of New Caldonia, tax will be due on new Caledonian assets transmitted.
Inheritance tax is levied on assets at their fair market value, with allowances taking into account the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary. Debts existing at the time of death are generally deductible in full.
No inheritance tax is due for inheritance between spouses (or partner of a _Pacte civil de solidarité_ [PACS]) and for inheritance between brothers and sisters living together under specific conditions.
Progressive tax rates (ranging from 5% to 20%) are applicable after a rebate of XPF 100,000 when beneficiaries are direct dependants (spouse or partner of a PACS).
Between non-related parties or non-direct dependants (siblings), the rate is ranging from 30% to 50%.
Life insurance contract are benefiting from a preferential tax regime when premiums has been paid by the deceased before they are 70.
Gift tax is subject to the same standard rules, but some differences could exist.
## Property taxes
The real estate tax is a tax established on the ownership of land and buildings, which varies according to the municipalities, neighborhoods, and type of construction.
Real estate property tax is levied on:
  * land
  * constructions, including fixed, and
  * industrial equipment and tools.


The principal tax is obtained by successively multiplying the surface area of the land or construction (gross surface area) by the rate per area or m2 (to determine the tax base) then, by the rate of 8.40% for buildings and 0.7875% for land.
## Business licence duty
Taxation of the business license (_contribution des patentes_) is compulsory for any natural or legal person who undertakes in New Caledonia the exercise of a trade, an industry, or a profession, for their own account and for profit.
It is calculated annually depending on the type and characteristics of the professional activity and is made up of a fixed fee (composed of a fixed tariff and additional tariffs) and a proportional duty (based on customs). If a company carries out its activity through several establishments, it will have to pay as many licences as it has establishments.
