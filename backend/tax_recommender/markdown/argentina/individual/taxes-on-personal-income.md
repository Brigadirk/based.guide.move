## Personal income tax (PIT) rates
### Employees with tax applied on highest incomes
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new "cedular regime" that was applied on the "highest incomes", understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum. Under this scenario, employees, retirees, and pensioners (not applicable to directors) should pay income tax only when their gross monthly salary was greater than 15 times the SMVM at the time of tax determination. In addition, a progressive scale was incorporated, whose rates will be established between 27% and 35%. This new regime was applicable since January to June 2024.
From July onwards, the “Cedular regime” was repealed by the Government and the income tax withholding mechanism that was in force up to September 2023 was reimplemented and updated (annual taxable income 35% tax rate over AR$ 41.316.075 after available deductions was reinstated).

## Gross income tax
Gross income tax is a provincial tax applicable to self-employed individuals on gross earnings. The average tax rate is 4% in the Federal Capital (the City of Buenos Aires), and similar rates are applicable in the different provinces. Professionals who do not perform their activity in the form of a company are exempt from the gross income tax in the City of Buenos Aires. The tax is paid by filing monthly tax returns.
## Foreign beneficiary tax
Foreign beneficiaries working temporarily in Argentina for no more than six months during the year, who earn income through either the visual or performing arts or other profession, are subject to income tax on these earnings at the rate of 24.5% (35% on assumed profit of 70% of gross income) to be withheld by the local payer. Other tax rates could apply depending on the type of income to be paid.
