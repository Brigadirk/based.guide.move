## Individual - Deductions
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
## Employment expenses
Social security taxes withheld by the employer are deductible from employment compensation for income tax purposes.
All personal deductions are also deductible from employment compensation. Employees are required to provide employers the information on personal deductions via an electronic Form 572 in order to be considered for income tax withholding calculations.
The annual electronic Form 572 may be filed during the year to update tax deductions when required, but final filing must be done prior to 31 March of the following fiscal year.
For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the government established by Law a new “cedular regime” that was applied on the “highest incomes”, understood as those salaries that exceed the equivalent of 180 times the SMVM (minimum, vital, and mobile salary) as a non-taxable minimum. Under this scenario, employees, retirees, and pensioners (not applicable to directors) should pay income tax only when their gross monthly salary was greater than 15 times the SMVM at the time of tax determination. In addition, a progressive scale was incorporated, whose rates will be established between 27% and 35%. This new regime was applicable since January to June 2024.
From July onwards, the “Cedular regime” was repealed by the Government and the income tax withholding mechanism that was in force up to September 2023 was reimplemented and updated (annual taxable income 35% tax rate over AR$ 41.316.075 after available deductions was reinstated).
## Personal deductions
### Education expenses
Expenses on educational services and the purchase of tools intended for education are deductible. The deduction applies to educational expenses for children, stepchildren, or minors under 18 years of age who are dependents of the taxpayer. It also extends to those over 18 and up to 24 years old who are pursuing regular or professional studies and do not have income exceeding the non-taxable minimum income.
The maximum amount to be deducted is 40% of the non-taxable minimum income for the corresponding fiscal period.

### Medical care contributions and expenses
Contributions to third-party medical schemes are deductible up to a maximum of 5% of net income. Other medical expenses may be deducted up to a maximum of 40% of all corresponding invoices of the fiscal year, provided the deduction does not exceed 5% of net income.

## Personal tax allowances
Residents and non-residents are allowed to deduct the following annual personal allowances regarding FY 2024:
Eligibility for allowance | Annual allowance (ARS)  
---|---  
Basic (provided the individual has been living in Argentina at least six months during the calendar year) |  3,503,688.17  
Spouse |  3299771.52  
Child (each younger than 18)  |  1.664.086.82  
Earned income allowance: Employees |  16,817,703.23  
Earned income allowance: Self-employed workers  |  12,262,908.60

Except for the earned-income allowance, personal and family allowances are applicable only when the taxpayers and their families, if eligible, have been living in Argentina for over six months during the tax year under consideration, and did not obtain income in excess of ARS 3,503,688.17 (FY 2024) during the same period.
## Business deductions
All losses and expenses incurred in obtaining and preserving taxable income are deductible, but living, personal and family expenses are not deductible, except for Pension Fund and other social security contributions. In cases where fringe benefits include lump-sum allowances for relocation expenses, household goods transportation, house hunting trip, and so on, only actual expenses incurred, supported by third-party vouchers, can be treated as a ‘business expense’ and accordingly be borne by the company as corporate expenses.
## Losses
Capital losses can only be deducted from taxable capital gains.
In order for the deduction to be allowed, capital losses must have been suffered in a transaction that, if profitable, would have resulted in taxable income.
Carryback of losses is not permitted.
Tax losses will not be offset with profits that must be taxed under the cedular regime.
