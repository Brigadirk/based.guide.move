Legal entities resident in Argentina are subject to tax on Argentine and foreign-source income. Resident legal entities are able to claim any similar taxes actually paid abroad on foreign-source income as a tax credit. The tax rate applies on net income determined on a worldwide basis.
A withholding tax (WHT) on dividend distributions and branch profit remittances is established at a rate of 7% (applicable for profits as of 2018).
The 2017 tax reform abolished the so-called ‘equalisation tax’ for profits generated in taxable years starting on or after 1 January 2018. The equalisation tax was a WHT levied at a 35% rate on dividend distributions in excess of tax earnings. The equalisation tax, however, remains applicable on dividend and branch profit distributions made out of earnings accumulated prior to 1 January 2018 and which were in excess of tax earnings as of the year-end prior to the relevant distribution.
Argentine-source income (e.g. royalties, interests) received by foreign entities is subject to WHT in full and final settlement at source (_see the section_).
