## Corporate - Corporate residence
Last reviewed - 05 February 2025
Corporate residence is determined on the basis of centres of activity, which may be the location of a companyâ€™s economic activity or management activity.
## Permanent establishment (PE)
Centres of activity in Argentina of non-Argentine corporations are treated as PEs.
As from 2017, Argentine Income Tax Law includes a PE definition aligned to the one included in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) Model Tax Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation, although it is broader as it includes the performance of services by a non-resident provider, including services rendered by consultants, within the National Territory for a total length greater than six months within any 12-month period.
