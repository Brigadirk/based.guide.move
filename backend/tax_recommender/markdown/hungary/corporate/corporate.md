However, no default penalty shall be imposed if the entity required to keep records, supply data, and retain records exculpates its non-compliance or late, erroneous, or incomplete compliance by certifying that it has acted as it may be usually expected in the given situation.
### Violation of the rules with regard to cash registers and customer application
As of 1 January 2024, the tax authority imposes a default fine of up to HUF 10 million on the distributor for the distribution of an e-register or customer application without an authorisation or for the distribution of an e-register or customer application other than an authorised one. Moreover, the tax authority may impose a default penalty of up to HUF 500,000 on natural persons and up to HUF 1 million on non-natural persons in the event of a breach of the statutory obligations relating to the mandatory use, distribution, and operation of registers. The tax authority may impose a default fine of up to HUF 1 million on the distributor if it has not attempted to repair the hardware-based e-register within five days of receiving the operator's notification.
As of January 2025 state tax and customs authority shall impose a default penalty amounting up to ten million HUF on the distributor in the case of distributing e-cash registers, buyer applications without a marketing authorization, continued distribution of e-cash registers, buyer applications after withdrawal of the marketing authorization, distribution of e-cash registers, buyer applications differing from the ones authorized, may impose a default penalty amounting to five hundred thousand HUF on the obliged person in the case of natural persons or up to one million forint in the case of non-natural persons, in the case of a violation of obligations determined by legal regulations with respect to the obligatory use, distribution, operation of e-cash registers.

## Corporate income tax (CIT)
### Global minimum tax
On 1 December 2023, the Hungarian Parliament promulgated the law on the introduction of a global minimum tax (GloBE), which transposes European Union (EU) Directive 2022/2523 into Hungarian law. The law follows to a large extent the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model rules and their commentary, including the Administrative Guidance published so far by the OECD.
The proposed bill contains a full list of Pillar 2 collection mechanisms, including a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax.
The collection mechanisms will come into force according to the following timetable:
  * Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) from 1 January 2024.
  * Undertaxed Payments Rule (UTPR) from 1 January 2025.
  * Qualified Domestic Deduction Top-up Tax (QDMTT) from 1 January 2024.


### Global minimum tax: new notification obligation
Hungarian constituent entities are obliged to submit a notification form to the Tax Authority regarding their Pillar 2 status. The notification form must be submitted within 12 months from the start date of the tax year beginning in 2024 - by December 31, 2024, for calendar year taxpayers – and every year thereafter.
## Local business tax (LBT)
### Change in the subject of the permanent establishment (PE) definition for air passenger transport entrepreneurs
On 1 January 2024, the definition of PE in The Act C of 1990 on Local Taxes was expanded. As a result, entrepreneurs who perform air passenger transport activities are subject to LBT in the jurisdiction of the local municipality where there is an airport from which these entrepreneur's flights depart, irrespective of not having any fixed establishments there. Additionally, due to the PE triggered for local business tax purposes, airlines would also be subject to innovation contribution, which is calculated as 0.3% of the same tax base.
As of 1 January 2025, the scope of affected entrepreneurs has been narrowed. According to the changes, those entrepreneurs who are resident in a state which is a party to the Convention on International Civil Aviation opened for signature in Chicago on 7 December 1944 are excluded from the scope of the PE definition.
## Value-added tax (VAT)
### The introduction of the Deposit Refund System (DRS)
In connection with the DRS, the range of goods to be introduced as of 1 January 2024 will be metal, plastic, and glass beverage packages with a capacity of 0 to 6 litres (with the exception of milk-based beverage products).
According to the VAT Act, unreturned products shall be regarded as supply of goods. The chargeable event shall occur and VAT shall become chargeable on the last day of the calendar year. The taxable amount means the return fees on products not returned by the date of the chargeable event, and the return fees on unreturned products shall be applied as it contains the VAT payable as commensurate.
According to the new provisions, VAT shall be payable by the taxable person operating a binding return fee scheme.
### Changes in VAT rates and VAT exempt cases
  * The definition of infant formulae under the 5% VAT rate was clarified based on the customs tariff number.
  * The supply of dental prostheses will be exempted from the tax.
  * The activity of transporting injured persons and patients by a service provider carrying out this activity with an official licence and using a vehicle specially equipped for this purpose is now exempt from VAT (until now, only taxable persons who were public service providers could carry out this type of activity exempt from tax).
  * Journals published at least once a year are also included in the 5% VAT rate (previously only journals published at least four times a week were included).
  * Journals published at least four times a week (daily newspapers) are under a 0% VAT rate.


### An increase in the maximum amount of the VAT exemption for members of diplomatic missions and professional consular posts
According to the amendment, the exemption provided for private purposes shall be available to the staff of diplomatic missions and consular posts and to officers of international bodies up to the limit determined according to reciprocity for any calendar year, up to maximum HUF 600,000, unless the international convention expressly provides otherwise.
### New reporting obligation on payment service providers
Starting from 1 January 2024, payment service providers shall keep records of certain intra-Community transactions and report this data to the tax authority. The record-keeping requirement shall apply to payment services provided as regards cross-border payments. A payment shall be considered a cross-border payment when the payer is located in a member state of the Community and the payee is located in another member state of the Community, in a third country, or in a territory considered equivalent to a third territory. Payment service providers shall supply data from their records by the end of the month following the given quarter.
### New exemption for military use
As of 1 July 2022, VAT exemption shall be applicable on the importation of goods by the armed forces (and the civilian staff accompanying them) of member states other than Hungary, when such forces take part in defence effort carried out for the implementation of a Union activity under the common security and defence policy.
### Major changes in the Electronic Road Freight Control System (EKAER)
As of 1 January 2021, the range of product to be reported has narrowed since EKAER numbers need to be requested only in case of transportation of risky products on the road. This means that if a product not included on the list of risky products is being transported on the road, EKAER obligation will not arise. Going forward, as of 1 January 2021, simplified reporting could be made on risky products as well.
New rules are coming into force in terms of sanctions: the 40% penalty on the transported goods might only be assessed in case of incomplete reporting or when the reporting is made incorrectly regarding the weight or value of the goods (other mistakes in the reported data results in a default penalty of HUF 500,000).
As of 1 January 2021, reliable taxpayers are not required to provide EKAER risk deposit; furthermore, no risk deposit is required for requesting EKAER numbers for products with the 5% reduced VAT rate.
Also, from 1 January 2021, individual road exemption can be requested for all traffic directions, and the permit will be valid until revoked.
As the Government Decree 403/2021 was published on 8 July, the scope of products subject to the EKAER reporting has been temporarily re-extended. According to the Decree, from 9 July the transport of raw materials and products of strategic importance for the security of supply of the construction industry are also subject to EKAER reporting.
For the sake of clarity, we note that this newly implemented rule has not extended the scope of risky products, but, in addition to them, it has included among the products to be reported the listed raw materials and products for construction. Also, in relation to these new products to be reported, no EKAER guarantee has to be provided. Please note, however, that although the taxable persons concerned are exempted from providing EKAER guarantee, they will still be subject to penalties for failure to submit an EKAER declaration.
The above-mentioned temporarily extended scope shall be applied until the end of October 2022.
### Place of supply of virtual services
As of 1 January 2025, subsection (1) shall not apply to events and programs where participation takes place virtually, instead where the services defined therein relate to activities which are streamed or otherwise made virtually available, the place of supply shall be the place where the non-taxable person to whom the service is provided is established or, in the absence of an establishment, has his permanent address or usually resides.
### Provisions governing access to tax exemption for taxable persons established in Hungary and applying such exemption in any other Member State of the Community as of January 2025
Section 195/A of the law applies to taxable persons who have their business established in Hungary or reside there. These persons can opt for tax exemption like Article 284 of the VAT Directive in another EU Member State. Key terms like "turnover in the Union" and "turnover in a Member State" are defined for clarity. The tax exemption can be chosen if the person's turnover in the Union is below 100,000 euros, both in the preceding and current calendar years, and the Member State-specific threshold is not exceeded.
The taxable person must notify the state tax and customs authority in Hungary of their choice in advance. Upon receipt, an individual identification number with an "EX" suffix is assigned, provided the conditions are met, within thirty-five working days. Any changes to the initial notification must also be communicated, including any new Member States involved. Notifications and amendments contain detailed information about the taxable person and their turnovers.
Section 195/B outlines the quarterly reporting requirements for those who have opted for the tax exemption, including turnover in Hungary and other Member States. Any exceedance of the 100,000 euros turnover limit must be reported within fifteen working days, along with detailed turnover data.
Section 195/C specifies the use of euros for reporting turnovers and exchange rate conversions if needed.
Section 195/D mandates that notifications and data submissions to the tax authority must be done electronically.
If certain conditions arise, such as exceeding the turnover limit or ceasing activities in a Member State, the state tax and customs authority will deactivate the individual identification number given under Subsection (4) of Section 195/A.
Section 195/F states that if the turnover limit is exceeded, the taxable person cannot opt for the tax exemption again until the end of the following year.
For taxable persons not established in Hungary but applying the exemption in Hungary, Section 195/G sets similar rules, with additional requirements for declaring in their home Member State.
Section 195/H specifies the exemption application process in Hungary based on identification from the home Member State.
Section 195/K details the termination conditions for the individual exemption, including options for reapplying after specific periods if the limit is exceeded or other criteria are not met.
## Social tax
The social tax payable by employers after employment income is 13%.
## Advertisement tax
From 1 July 2019, provisionally until 31 December 2025, the advertisement tax rate is reduced to 0%, and taxpayers subject to the advertisement tax do not have to fulfil their reporting and filing obligations during this period.

From 2025, the environmental product fee obligation ceases for products that were subject to both the product fee regulation and the Extended Producer Responsibility system, and in the future only other oil products, other plastic products and other chemical products will be subject to the product fee.
Accordingly, the product fee administrative obligation (i.e. the declaration and registration obligation) ceases for packaging/packaging materials (except for plastic bags), electrical and electronic equipment, tires, batteries, advertising carrier paper and office paper.
For these product groups, the obligations prescribed in the Extended Producer Responsibility system, including data provision and payment of the Extended Producer Responsibility fee, must continue to be fulfilled.
