## Corporate - Branch income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
Rates for Dutch branch (or PE) profits of non-resident companies are the same as for other corporate profits, but no (withholding) tax is withheld on transfers of profits from the branch to the head office. The tax base is, in principle, calculated on the same rules as for Dutch-resident companies.
