## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 16 January 2025
The Netherlands taxes its residents on their worldwide income; non-residents are subject to tax only on income derived from specific sources in the Netherlands (mainly income from employment, directorâ€™s fees, business income, and income from Dutch immovable property).
## Personal income tax rates
In the Netherlands, worldwide income is divided into three different types of taxable income, and each income type is taxed separately under its own schedule, referred to as a 'box'. Each box has its own tax rate(s). An individual's taxable income is based on the aggregate income in these three boxes.
Box 1 refers to taxable income from work and home ownership, and includes the following:
  * Employment income.
  * Home ownership of a principal residence (deemed income).
  * Periodic receipts and payments.
  * Benefits relating to income provisions.


Box 2 refers to taxable income from a substantial interest.
Box 3 applies to taxable income from savings and investment (_see the_ _section for more information_).
