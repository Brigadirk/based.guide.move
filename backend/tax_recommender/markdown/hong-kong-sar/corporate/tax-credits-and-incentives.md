## Foreign tax credits
Foreign tax credits are available if foreign taxes are payable/paid by a Hong Kong tax resident on income derived from a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR and the same income is subject to tax in Hong Kong SAR. Taxpayers are required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR. _See the section for a list of jurisdictions that have entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR_.
For foreign taxes payable/paid by a Hong Kong tax resident on specified foreign-sourced income deemed taxable under the refined FSIE regime, foreign tax credits are available irrespective of whether or not the foreign taxes are paid in a jurisdiction that has entered into a CDTA with Hong Kong SAR. Taxpayers are also required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the foreign tax payable before making a claim for tax credit in Hong Kong SAR.
## Foreign investment incentives
Hong Kong SAR does not have any specific incentives for foreign investment, except that offshore funds may be exempt from profits tax under certain circumstances.
## Other tax incentives
_Please refer to the section for other tax incentives that can be enjoyed by both foreign and Hong Kong companies_.
