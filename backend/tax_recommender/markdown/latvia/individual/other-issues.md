### An individual's indirect income from a partnership
The allocation of a partnership's taxable income to an individual partner should be increased by the corresponding part of the partnership's income from:
  * selling shares in companies that are not resident in a tax haven
  * dividends the partnership receives from companies that are not resident in a tax haven, and
  * selling EU/EEA publicly traded securities that are not central or local government securities (including interest payments received on bonds).


A partnership's tax return for the tax period should detail the allocation of taxable income to each individual partner.
