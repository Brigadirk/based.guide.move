## Foreign tax relief
Taiwan uses the credit method to avoid double taxation of income. Foreign taxes paid on foreign-sourced income may be credited against total Taiwan income tax liability. However, the credit is limited to the incremental taxes derived from the foreign-sourced income.
## Tax treaties
_See the_ _section in the Corporate summary for a list of countries with which Taiwan has a tax treaty._
