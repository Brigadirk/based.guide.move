## Foreign tax relief
Taiwan uses the credit method to avoid double taxation of income. Foreign taxes paid on foreign-sourced income may be credited against total Taiwan income tax liability. However, the credit is limited to the incremental taxes derived from the foreign-sourced income.
## Tax treaties

## Individual - Significant developments
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
## Tax incentives for foreign expatriates
Starting from tax year 2018, the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals provides preferential tax treatment for foreign individuals who have obtained the Employment Gold Card or Foreign Special Professional Work Permit and are approved to reside in Taiwan for the purpose of work for the first time.
If a foreign special professional meets both of the following criteria, 50% of the salary income in excess of 3 million new Taiwan dollars (TWD) is exempt from Taiwan income tax and non-Taiwan source income is excluded from the calculation of the individual’s income basic tax (IBT):
  * The individual stays in Taiwan for 183 days or more in a calendar year.
  * The individual's annual Taiwan-sourced salary income is in excess of TWD 3 million.


The tax incentive can be applied for five consecutive years from the first year that the foreign special professional meets both requirements. 
## Salary deduction
Starting from 1 January 2019 onwards, individuals may elect to use either (i) fixed salary deduction (currently TWD 207,000) or (ii) specific expense deduction to calculate taxable salary income, whichever is more beneficial.
Under the specific expense deduction regime, three prescribed expense categories can be deducted from salary income. The prescribed expense items shall be incurred directly in relation to the provision of services by the individual and should be actually borne by the income recipient. The specific expense deduction is limited to 3% of total salary income for each expense category per person per year.
## Resume taxation on capital gain derived by resident individuals from disposal of shares in non-listed or non-OTC companies effective 1 January 2021
The Legislative Yuan passed amendments to Articles 12 & 18 of the Income Basic Tax (IBT) Act, effective 1 January 2021, to resume taxation of capital gain derived by resident individuals from disposal of shares in non-listed or non-OTC companies (including certificate of entitlement to new shares, payment certificate for share consideration, or document of title to shares, etc.), which shall be included in the IBT tax base and subject to IBT.
However, to foster the development of innovative start-up companies and industrial transformation, disposal of shares in domestic high-risk innovative start-up companies that have been established for no more than five years may be exempt from the aforementioned regulation, subject to approval from the central competent authority.

## Individual - Taxes on personal income
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
Individual income tax (IIT) is levied on Taiwan-sourced income of both resident and non-resident individuals, unless exempt under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and other laws.
## Individual income tax (IIT) rates
A non-resident alien residing in Taiwan for less than 90 days in a calendar year is subject to 18% withholding tax (WHT) on salary remuneration received from a Taiwan-registered entity. Remuneration received from an entity registered outside of Taiwan is tax exempted.
A non-resident alien residing in Taiwan for more than 90 days but less than 183 days in a calendar year is subject to tax at a flat rate of 18% on Taiwan taxable salary income, regardless of where the remuneration is paid.
A resident alien is subject to the following progressive tax rates for 2022 IIT return filing:
Taxable income (TWD) | Tax rate (%) | Less progressive difference (TWD)  
---|---|---  
Over | Not over  
0 | 560,000 | 5 | 0  
560,001 | 1,260,000 | 12 | 39,200  
1,260,001 | 2,520,000 | 20 | 140,000  
2,520,001 | 4,720,000 | 30 | 392,000  
4,720,001 | and above | 40 | 864,000  
## Income basic tax (IBT)
In addition to regular income tax calculations under the Income Tax Act, Taiwan also imposes IBT, at a flat rate of 20%, on individuals who are tax residents in Taiwan (including expatriates who stay in Taiwan for 183 days or more in a tax year). Foreign-sourced income is included in the calculation of IBT if the following criteria are met:
  * The individual is a tax resident of Taiwan.
  * Foreign-sourced income is equal to or more than TWD 1 million with basic income exceeding TWD 6.7 million.


Under the IBT Act, a taxpayer must calculate the amount of IBT due on income subject to IBT after adding back certain items and compare the result with the regular income tax payable. If the IBT payable is greater than the regular income tax payable, the taxpayer has to calculate and pay IBT based on the following formula:
  * Income subject to IBT = Regular taxable income + add-back items
  * IBT = (Income subject to IBT - TWD 6.7 million) x 20%


The add-back items include qualified insurance benefits, income derived from transaction of beneficiary certificates of privately placed securities investment trust funds, non-cash charitable donations, and foreign-sourced income totalling TWD 1 million or more.
Note that although the inclusion of foreign-sourced income increases the IBT burden, any foreign taxes paid on foreign-sourced income may be credited against IBT payable, with certain limitations.

## Taxable period
The tax year is the same as the calendar year, which runs from 1 January through 31 December.
## Tax returns
Husbands and wives must file joint returns if both the husband and wife have resided in Taiwan for more than 183 days in a calendar year. There are three options available for filing a joint return:
  1. A joint return is filed by husband and wife incorporating all types of income to determine the taxes due. 
  2. A spouse can calculate taxes due on that spouse’s salaries/wages separately, with additional taxes calculated on remaining joint income (including income derived by dependants claimed in the tax filing unit). 
  3. A spouse can include other types of income earned by that spouse together with salaries/wages earned to calculate the taxes due, with additional taxes calculated on remaining joint income (including income derived by dependants claimed in the tax filing unit). 


The third option is provided as an alternative so that married couples are not penalised for higher progressive tax rates due to filing of joint return and consolidation of all earnings.
Non-residents who are in Taiwan for less than 90 days in a calendar year are not required to file an income tax return as long as tax is withheld by the local employer on compensation paid in Taiwan.
Individual taxpayers should settle the tax balance due (if any) and file an annual individual income tax return with the Taiwan tax authority before 31 May of the following year, with no extensions available.
## Payment of tax
There is income tax withholding on locally paid salaries. Additional tax due must be paid at the time of filing before 31 May of the following year.
For late payment, interest will be imposed on the outstanding tax balance due on a daily basis from 1 June to the actual date of tax settlement.

  * Special deduction for salaries or wages may be elected to use either: (i) fixed salary deduction (limited to TWD 207,000/person or total salary income reported, whichever is lower) or (ii) specific expense deduction to calculate taxable salary income, whichever is more beneficial. Under the specific expense deduction regime, three prescribed expense categories can be deducted from salary income. The prescribed expense items shall be incurred directly in relation to the provision of services by the individual and should be actually borne by the income recipient. The specific expense deduction is limited to 3% of total salary income for each expense category per person per year. The three prescribed expense categories are listed as follows: 
    * Occupational clothing expense: Expenses incurred for special clothing items or performance dedicated clothing required for one’s occupation, including purchase cost, rental expense, cleaning fee, and maintenance expense.
    * Training expense: Expenses incurred for participating in training courses covering specific skills or expertise delivered by qualified institutions associated with current occupation or work, or required by law.
    * Occupational tool expense: Expenses incurred for purchasing books, periodicals, or other tools that are solely used for one’s occupation. If the useful life of the aforementioned items exceed two years, and the expense incurred exceeds a certain amount, the purchase amount shall be depreciated or amortised annually.
  * Special deduction for long-term care (TWD 120,000 per person, which is only allowed for a taxpayer whose applicable regular income tax rate is less than 20% after deducting the said special deduction, or where the income subject to IBT is less than TWD 6.7 million). 


A non-resident alien is not eligible for any special deductions.
## Personal exemptions

A non-resident alien is not eligible for any personal exemptions.
## Basic living expenses difference
The total basic living expense shall be calculated in accordance with the expenses of basic living for each person announced by the Ministry of Finance multiplied by the number of taxpayer, spouse, and dependants. If the amount of basic living expense is higher than the sum of personal exemption, standard deduction (or itemised deduction), and special deductions (not including deduction for salaries or wages), the difference can be used as an additional deduction from the gross consolidated income.
For tax year 2022, the basic living expenses was TWD 196,000 per person.

## Individual - Income determination
Last reviewed - 19 August 2024
## Employment income
An alien is taxed on salaries, bonuses, and commissions earned for work performed in Taiwan, regardless of where payment is made. Fringe benefits provided to a foreign employee in the form of cash allowances via payroll are taxable regardless of the nature of the benefits. Fringe benefits provided directly by the employer without cash payment to the employee are also taxable unless the foreign employee qualifies for special tax incentives and specific arrangements are made.
However, there is one exception. If an assignee stays in Taiwan for 90 days or less in a calendar year, the assignee’s income received from an employer outside of the territory of Taiwan can be exempted from Taiwan income tax assessment.
## Capital gains
Taiwan does not impose a separate capital gains tax (CGT), as all gains, unless specifically exempted by law, or as otherwise regulated, are assessed as ordinary income and subject to regular income tax assessment. CGT on securities has been abolished effective from 1 January 2016. Please note that capital gains derived from sales of Taiwan-based securities prior to 1 January 2016 are still subject to CGT if certain conditions are met.
