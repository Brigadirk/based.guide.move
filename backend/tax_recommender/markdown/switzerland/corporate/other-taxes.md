## Value-added tax (VAT)
As a matter of principle, proceeds of sales made and services provided in Switzerland are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 8.1%. Goods for basic needs are subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 2.6%. Furthermore, services in connection with the provision of lodging (accommodation) are subject to VAT at the special rate of 3.8%.
Any person, regardless of legal form, objects, and intention to make a profit, is liable to VAT if that person carries on a business and is not exempt from the tax liability. A person carries on a business if the person independently performs a professional or commercial activity with the aim of sustainably earning income from supplies and acts externally under the person's own name. Taxable persons must register with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration of their own accord in writing within certain deadlines. A registered taxpayer generally is entitled (in the course of its business activity) to offset the amount of VAT charged by suppliers or paid on imports against the VAT payable.
The tax liability of foreign companies that supply goods to Switzerland is calculated on their worldwide turnover. Accordingly, if a company generates less than 100,000 Swiss francs (CHF) from the supply of goods to Switzerland, but at least CHF 100,000 in turnover globally, it is liable for VAT in Switzerland from its first Swiss franc of turnover.
Since 1 January 2019, foreign-based mail-order companies are liable for VAT in Switzerland if they generate at least CHF 100,000 annual turnover from small consignments to Switzerland. Such foreign-based mail-order companies are equated with the Swiss companies for VAT purposes.
The VAT rates are dependent on the goods sold or the services provided. Some supplies are exempt from tax without credit (e.g. hospital treatment, cultural services, insurance and reinsurance turnovers, specific turnovers in the field of money and capital transactions), and some supplies are fully exempt from tax (e.g. supply of goods that are transported or dispatched directly abroad / export). The difference relates to the fact that input VAT related to supplies exempt from tax without credit cannot be deducted, whereas supplies exempt from tax are fully eligible for input VAT deduction.
**Upcoming changes in VAT – 2025**
The Federal Council implemented the partial revision of the Value Added Tax Act (VAT Act) in August 2024, which was passed by Parliament in June 2023, and will enter into effect on 1 January 2025. At the same time, the partially revised Value Added Tax Ordinance (VAT Ordinance) will enter into effect as well. An exception is the portal obligation for the areas of net tax rate as well as flat tax rate method, group taxation, and deregistration as a taxable person, which will not be introduced until 1 January 2027. The partially revised VAT Ordinance includes both the implementing provisions for the amended VAT Act and independent adjustments, particularly concerning the net tax and flat tax rate method as well as portal obligations.
Additionally, the amendment to the VAT Ordinance at the level of net tax rates will also enter into effect on 1 January 2025. The review of net tax rates, conducted every seven years, has resulted in tax rate adjustments for approximately 15% of industries and activities.
**Introduction of a tax liability for online platforms**
One of the important elements of the partial revision of the VAT Act is the introduction of platform taxation. Starting 1 January 2025, a ‘deemed supplier concept’ will be introduced for sales of goods conducted through online platforms, thus, the obligation to register for VAT will shift from the supplier to the platform. From a VAT perspective, there are not just one but two deliveries: a first supply of goods is assumed to be between the seller and the platform operator. A second supply of goods is assumed to be between the platform operator and the Swiss customer; thus, the platform has to charge, declare, collect and remit the VAT on the supplies of goods to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (SFTA).
Furthermore, an obligation to provide information is introduced for all online platforms (i.e. upon request by the SFTA, they must provide information on suppliers offering supplies via the platform to an extent that could trigger VAT liability. To enforce the new rules, the SFTA can take administrative measures if mail order platforms or companies have wrongfully failed to register or if they do not meet their billing and payment obligations. The SFTA can impose an import ban on deliveries from the company in question and as a last resort, order the destruction of the items. In addition, the SFTA can publish the names of the companies against which such measures are applied in order to protect customers.
**Simplifying VAT O****b****ligations for SME’s**
Currently, VAT can be settled quarterly, half-yearly or monthly. As of 1 January 2025 SMEs can also voluntarily settle VAT annually (i.e. submitting an annual VAT return), making the settlement process more efficient. This option is only available to VAT-liable persons who generate an annual turnover of a maximum of CHF 5,005,000. Annual settlement is linked to the obligation to pay instalments. The instalments are set by the SFTA, usually based on the tax claim from the last tax period.
**Fiscal representation (platforms)**
The SFTA has the option to waive the requirement for appointing a tax representative, if the fulfillment of procedural obligations is ensured in another way (according to the draft practice publications, this is option is only foreseen for online platforms). Platform operators can confirm in writing to the SFTA that they meet the conditions set by the SFTA. In the event of an inspection by the SFTA or the initiation of administrative or criminal proceedings by the SFTA, the platform operator must provide a domestic correspondence address.
It is not yet clear how often the SFTA will actually waive this requirement. Also, it is not yet clear how the SFTA will determine when a tax representative is still required (e.g. when registering a foreign entity for Swiss VAT).
**Reduction and Exemptions of VAT**
Newly exempt from VAT (without credit) as of 1 January 2025 are:
  * Travel services and related services resold by domestic and foreign travel agencies (foreign travel agencies will therefore not be subject to VAT in Switzerland when organizing travel to Switzerland);


  * Active participation in cultural events;


  * Services related to coordinated care in medical treatments (Managed Care);


  * Provision of infrastructure for attending physicians in out-patient facilities and day hospitals;


  * Care and household services provided by private home care organizations (Spitex);


  * Provision of staff by all non-profit organizations;


  * Offering of investment groups by investment foundations in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on Occupational Old Age, Survivors', and Invalidity Pension Provision (OPA) and the management of investment groups in accordance with the OPA.


**Serial****Defaulters**
As of 1 January 2025, the SFTA can demand a security from individuals responsible for a legal entity (i.e., members of the board etc.) if there is a range of indications that their conduct could endanger taxes, interest and costs (procedural and enforcement costs). It aims at members of executive bodies who deliberately cause serial bankruptcies by robbing companies of their assets and, for example, transferring them to straw men who bring about liquidation. It must be clear from the totality of the circumstances that there is non-compliant behaviour that could give rise to criminal prosecution.
**Acquisition tax on transfer of emission rights**
The acquisition tax (reverse charge mechanism) will apply when trading/transferring emission rights, certificates for reducing emissions, proof of electricity sources, and similar documents as of 1 January 2025. Sales to domestic companies will be subject to acquisition tax, even if the seller is VAT-registered in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. This measure addresses VAT fraud risks in the transfer of such rights and certificates.
**S****ubsidies (legal fiction)**
According to the new provision of the VAT Act, a subsidy always exists if a public authority expressly describes the funds as a subsidy or other public-law contribution (legal fiction).
The VAT ordinance clarifies that public authorities can classify funds as subsidy or other public contribution until the finalization deadline for the tax period in which the payment was made.
## Customs duties
All goods arriving in Switzerland from abroad are generally subject to customs duty and import VAT. The customs duty is calculated on the gross weight of imported goods, where category-specific weight rates apply. Products like alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, food, and textiles are typical categories of higher duty rates. Furthermore, imported goods are subject to import VAT of generally 8.1%. A reduced rate of 2.6% applies on certain goods (e.g. food, non-alcoholic beverages, books, magazines, pharmaceutical products).
## Excise taxes
In Switzerland, various excise taxes are levied. To name a few, the following excise taxes are levied at the federal level:
  * VAT (_see above_)
  * Petroleum tax
  * Performance-related Heavy Vehicle Fee
  * National road tax (motorway tax sticker)
  * Beer excise tax/Tax on alcohol
  * Tobacco excise tax
  * Radio and television fee (corporate fee)


## Property taxes
With regard to the ownership and the transfer of real estate property in Switzerland, property taxes may apply. Depending on the location of the real estate property, ownership-related property taxes are levied at the cantonal and/or communal levels or do not exist at all.
In case of the sale of real estate property, real estate transfer tax and taxes on the capital gain may apply.
At the federal level, capital gain realised on the sale of real estate property is subject to ordinary CIT. At the cantonal and communal levels, depending on the canton concerned, capital gain realised is either subject to the ordinary CIT (dualistic method) or subject to a special real estate capital gain tax (monistic method).
It is at the discretion of the authority of the cantons to decide how real estate capital gains shall be taxed within their territory.
## Securities transfer tax
Swiss securities transfer tax (often known as 'securities turnover tax' or 'transfer stamp tax') is levied on the transfer of Swiss or foreign securities, in which Swiss security dealers participate as contracting parties or as intermediaries. The ordinary tax rate of Swiss securities transfer tax is 0.15% for securities issued by a tax resident of Switzerland and 0.3% for securities issued by a tax resident of a foreign country.
Swiss security dealers are defined as any person professionally engaged in buying or selling of securities for one's own account or for another person, including Swiss banks and other Swiss bank-like institutions. The definition also includes companies holding taxable securities whose book value exceeds CHF 10 million and remote members of a Swiss stock exchange.
Taxable securities include, but are not limited to, shares and bonds. Options and many other derivative instruments are not subject to Swiss securities transfer tax. However, the exercise of such financial instruments or derivatives may result in a taxable transfer of a security.
Various transactions are exempt from the Swiss securities transfer tax. Generally, no Swiss securities transfer tax is levied in the case of a merger or a reorganisation in which a Swiss security dealer is involved, and taxable securities (including participation) are transferred. Furthermore, the like-kind exchange of a participation by a Swiss security dealer is also exempt from the Swiss securities transfer tax. This is particularly important for holding companies, which may qualify as Swiss security dealers.
## Issuance stamp tax
Issuance stamp tax (often known as ‘capital duty’) on equity contributions to Swiss corporations is levied at the rate of 1% on the fair market value of the contribution. An exemption on the first CHF 1 million of equity in exchange for ownership rights applies, whether made in an initial or subsequent contribution.
A multitude of transactions qualify for an issuance stamp tax exemption. In particular, special tax provisions allow for most reorganisations to take place on a tax neutral basis. In addition, an existing non-resident company may generally redomicile to Switzerland without incurring Swiss issuance stamp tax. However, if the company was formed abroad and re-domiciled to Switzerland exclusively or mainly in order to avoid Swiss stamp taxes, issuance stamp tax may apply.
The issuance of Swiss bonds and money market instruments is not subject to Swiss issuance stamp tax.
In addition, the conversion of certain contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) into equity will also not trigger Swiss issuance stamp tax on the newly created equity. In more detail, this relief applies to CoCos according to the Swiss banking law only; other convertible bonds will still trigger Swiss issuance stamp tax if converted into equity.
## Capital tax
Corporate capital tax is only levied at the cantonal and the communal levels (not at the federal level). It is based on a corporation’s equity (i.e. the taxable equity corresponds to the sum of nominal capital, paid in surplus, retained earnings, other equity reserves, and, according to Swiss thin capitalisation rules, potentially existing deemed or hidden equity). The ordinary capital tax rates vary between 0.001% and 0.5%, depending on the company’s location of corporate residence in Switzerland. The Federal Act on the Harmonisation of Direct Taxation at Cantonal and Communal Levels allows the cantons to introduce an adaptation of the capital tax base for participations, patents, and loans to group companies.
The cantons are further allowed to foresee in their tax law that CIT is creditable against a corporation’s capital tax. By now, many cantons have introduced such a credit mechanism.
## Wage tax withholding (tax at source)
Employees meeting certain criteria (e.g. Swiss tax resident foreign nationals without a permanent residence permit, non-Swiss tax resident individuals) are subject to wage tax withholding. In such case, it is the employer’s obligation to withhold the appropriate wage tax on the employee’s gross salary. The wage taxes cover the employee’s federal, cantonal, and communal taxes as well as church tax (if applicable) (_see the section of Switzerland’s Individual tax summary_).
## Social security contributions
Employers, in general, are required to account for social security contributions on the salaries of their employees. If the employee is subject to the Swiss social security system, the following compulsory social security contributions are concerned (_see the_ _section of Switzerland’s Individual tax summary_):
  * Old-age, survivors’, and disability insurance (2024: 10.6%; divided equally between employer and employee).
  * Unemployment insurance (2.2% on income up to CHF 148,200; the employee’s share is one half).
  * Family compensation fund (0.3% to 3.5%; usually fully employer financed).
  * Occupational accident insurance (approximately 0.17%; fully employer financed).
  * Non-occupational accident insurance (generally 1% to 4%, depending on the field of activity and company’s insurance contract; borne by the employee in principle).
  * Occupational pension scheme (2nd pillar) (contributions depend on pension plan; the employee’s share is usually half of the total contribution, whereas the employer bears the other half).
