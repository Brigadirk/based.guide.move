## Transactions with tax havens
Expenses that are paid by Nicaraguan residents to an individual or entity that is a resident of a tax haven are subject to a 30% WHT. For this purpose, a tax haven may be:
  * a foreign territory where the income tax is ‘substantially’ lower than the Nicaraguan income tax
  * a foreign country or territory that has been listed, for the corresponding taxable year, as a non-cooperative jurisdiction by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, or
  * a foreign territory that is listed by the Nicaraguan Public Credit and Finance Ministry.


Note that the Nicaraguan government has not published the list of territories deemed as tax havens.
