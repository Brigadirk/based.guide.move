Last reviewed - 19 December 2024
Taxable income is determined by the sum of all income derived from Nicaraguan sources, less allowable deductions, which generally include all expenses necessary to generate taxable income. Taxable income is computed according to Nicaraguan income tax law.
## Inventory valuation
Last in first out (LIFO), first in first out (FIFO), and the average cost methods are accepted for inventory valuation purposes. The tax authorities must authorise the change of a valuation method.
## Capital gains and losses
Capital income and capital gains and losses are subject to definitive WHT and are not treated as ordinary taxable corporate income. The general rule is that capital income and capital gains are subject to 15% WHT; however, the following exceptions apply:

  * Capital gains derived from the transfer of assets subject to annotation in the public registry (e.g. real estate, vehicles) will be subject to a final WHT based on the amount of the transaction, as follows:  Good value (USD*) | WHT rate (%)
