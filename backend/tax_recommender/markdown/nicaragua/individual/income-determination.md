## Employment income
Income from work includes every kind of compensation and remuneration, whatever their denomination or nature, money or in kind, that is derived from the personal work rendered on behalf of others, such as salaries, variable salaries, seniority bonds, bonuses, allowances, performance recognition, and any other remuneration derived from work. There are no concessions of any kind to foreigners. Total personal gross income can be estimated _ex officio_ by the fiscal establishment.
