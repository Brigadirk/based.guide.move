Do you think empiricism is baloney? Fed up with static cultures and anti-rational memes? Then you're exactly the kind of universal explainer we are looking for. 

Join 60+ other critical rationalists (colloquially: crit-rats), appreciators of the intellectual legacy of philosopher Karl Popper, and David Deutsch, the physicist whose book "The Beginning of Infinity" has unleashed a generation of optimists; a work whose ideas are so powerful, some have categorised their lives in a "before" and "after".

Crit rats flock to Philly from Many Worlds to creatively conjecture and critique the most exciting ideas in philosophy, science, art, morality, and pizza-baking. Discuss with new friends and old whether Deutsch's Four Strands of a scientific worldview could use a fifth, even a sixth. Or connect any one of the four, be it Alan Turing's theory of computation, Hugh Everett's formulation of quantum mechanics, Popper's radical revision of epistemology, or Dawkin's replicators, to your favourite topic, whether that is your favourite composer, poet, or the feasibility of Artificial General Intelligence. 

Watch talks, attend workshops, and join he after-party where some inebriated crit-rats may try to convince you that anarcho-capitalism is the end of history, while another argues that it cannot be so. To keep your and body fueled and ready for such exhaustion, you'll be fed properly and regularly, courtesy of the Cambria's hotel outstanding catering. 

If the above sounds appealing to you; if you're at all curious, intrigued, don't hesitate to get your ticket now or contact us for more information. We appreciate all those interested in big ideas, even confused empiricists. We've reserved 50 bedrooms at the hotel, many of them family-sized. Children are welcome, and taken seriously if they wish to participate in any of the goings-on.
